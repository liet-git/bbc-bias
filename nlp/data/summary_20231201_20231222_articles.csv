Wael Arafat, 28, moved from Deir Al Balah to Bristol when he was young and is calling for a ceasefire. His mother, Patricia Davis-Thomas, said he is ""very unwell"" and that he has 17 family members who have been killed. She explained that seven days after he started the hunger strike, they had to call for an ambulance. Israel says that for the first time since the fighting began in October, aid has entered Gaza through the Kerem Shalom crossing.  Until now there have only been limited deliveries through the Rafah Crossing with Egypt.  An increasing number of countries are calling for a ceasefire. in the Israel-Gaza war. Mr Arafat from Bristol has been refusing food at the Royal United Hospital in Bath. Speaking to BBC Arabic, Mr Arafat said: ""I probably have a week or two before I die.  ""I want the world to do something and not for me, but I want the world to do something for the people of Gaza, for the children, the elderly and the youth. "" Ms Davis-Thomas said: ""He came to this country to be safe.  ""He's been traumatised, but he's always had a very strong link to Palestine, even though he left there when he was very young.  ""He expresses his distress around the children that are being harmed. He remembers himself as a child living in Palestine, under occupation. ""  Mr Arafat told the BBC he did not want to stop the hunger strike until, ""they hear us and know that we are not animals, we are humans and when I see the ceasefire in Gaza. "" Ms Davis-Thomas added: ""I took in a young lad of 14. I brought him up in the way he should have been brought up, in the way that his family would have wanted him to be brought up. "" ""So I learnt about his culture. I knew nothing about Palestine before he came to me. I helped him in his education. I got him to this point. "" ""Now I just feel I'm going to lose my son and nobody has a right to die like that. I'm trying to save my son here. "" She said she wanted people to think about those in Palestine running for their and their children's lives.  Ms David-Thomas said he is ""critical"" in hospital and has managed to encourage him to have a little fluid. She added: ""I tell him every day in hospital - you have a right to protest. We all have a right to protest. But you don't have to take it to the point where you have to die. "" ""He wants to be heard, he doesn't want to die. He's expressed that to the doctors and they are trying to do their best by him. ""But if he doesn't take fluids, if he isn't encouraged to start to eat, then he will die. "" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the Israeli government is still trying to complete the recovery of all the hostages held in Gaza, saying military pressure on Hamas was needed to secure their release. Mr Netanyahu has indicated that talks are happening, and there are reports which suggest both Egypt and Qatar are involved in the discussions. But Hamas has said there will be no negotiations to release hostages ""unless the aggression against our people stops once and for all"". Follow BBC West on Facebook, X and Instagram.

1677,2023-12-04 20:39:35+00:00,/news/world-middle-east-67592794,"The BBC's Rushdi Abualouf, who has reported from Gaza for decades, left the territory with his family on 20 November for the sake of their safety. It was six weeks after the Hamas attacks on southern Israel that has led to weeks of Israeli bombardment within Gaza. He is now in Istanbul, Turkey. Speaking on the BBC's Newshour programme, he described how it felt to leave his home and observe Gaza from the outside. My family and I grew up in Gaza, we were born in Gaza. I really feel sad that I have had to leave in this way.  I have a memory from every corner of my house, and from every corner of my neighbourhood.  The rest of my wife's family - her father, mother and brother - are still there, while my father, brothers and sisters also remain in Gaza. To be honest, it's more difficult for me to watch Gaza from the outside, because when I was there, inside the enclave, I was busy dealing with too many things and not thinking about the situation in the Strip.  Now, when you are out, you have more time to think. And it's very hard for me to imagine that I will no longer see my house or sleep in my bed, and I will no longer see my neighbours and my neighbourhood. Since we left for Istanbul, we were told that our home was destroyed. I mean the whole building, the whole neighbourhood was destroyed.  Some of my BBC Arabic colleagues are still there. I met them all one night before I left because I wasn't sure about the timing, and there was a surprise call in the night telling me to leave.  I told them I would do everything I could to get them out.  ""Be strong and work together, the BBC is very proud of you, the BBC will do everything possible to protect you and try to get you out,"" I told them. I've called them every morning since I left Gaza. I'm always with them, always advising them, helping them solve every problem they are facing in their location or with their family, and hopefully they will be out soon. My family had a chance to leave right at the beginning. When Hamas attacked southern Israel on 7 October, my first call was to the BBC to tell them what happened. The second was to my wife. I said to her: ""Please prepare your bag, you have to leave Gaza now. "" I was expecting a very big retaliation from Israel, and the Rafah crossing was still open for the first couple of days after the Hamas raids. At the beginning, my wife did not realise how big the situation would be and how dangerous it was. I would have to stay to work, and because she didn't want us to be apart, she refused and said: ""We will stay together, live together. "" On the third day we lost this chance - the Rafah crossing was bombed and closed. And then you have to deal with so many things.  You have to deal with your old father who lives far away from you. You have to learn to deal with your family and you have to deal with your job.  You have to report, and all the time in the back of your mind is your father, in the back of your mind is your wife, your kids, your place - whenever they drop a bomb, you think: is it close to your house?   After we were forced to leave Gaza City, we first arrived in Khan Younis and stayed with family for a couple of days.  Then there was a warning that the house would be bombed. So we had to leave and found ourselves with nowhere to go. I decided to put up a tent near a workspace I'd set up in Nasr hospital in Khan Younis. My family stayed there for about a week.  I found a house near the hospital so that they could be close to me, so if something happened I could rush to them.  My flat in Gaza City was 170 sq m, but now everyone was squeezed into one small room. They were worried about me not being with them all the time, and also there was not enough food. My wife was injured that day when she tried to come and see me. The kids were crying that they wanted to see their dad and they decided to go from the house to the hospital.  When they arrived, one of the buildings was hit - that day they almost died. Now that we are out, I know that I will definitely go back. I always say as a journalist that Gaza is the perfect place to be - because you will find a story on every corner.  But for me personally, my family has been suffering for a very long time.  I told my wife when we left Gaza, when we walked out of the gate: ""I will not let you go back under any circumstances.  ""So you have to start establishing your life somewhere else. ""  Now my kids are happy to be out, to go back to a normal life, though they still miss everything. But I am a journalist, and as soon as the situation allows me to go back to Gaza I will, because I'm connected to this story and I think those 2.3 million people in the Strip deserve having somebody to tell their story.

1678,2023-12-01 21:35:04+00:00,/news/world-middle-east-67595798,"""She doesn't deserve to wait for the next deal, just because she's not somebody's mother or grandmother,"" writes Or Neko Maymon on Facebook in Hebrew.  Or is talking about 27-year-old street artist and art student Inbar Haiman, who is his partner's sister.  Inbar was kidnapped by Hamas from the Supernova music festival in Israel on 7 October, and was seen days later in a hostage video circulated on social media, with blood on her face.  She is one of 16 women BBC Verify has identified as still being captive in Gaza, following a seven-day ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. This pause in fighting saw Hamas agree to release 110 hostages (including 78 women and children), in return for 240 Palestinian prisoners being freed from Israeli jails.  Israel's focus on securing the release of female hostages has raised and dashed hopes for the families of the women who are still left behind.  Since her kidnap, Inbar's friends and family have been campaigning for her release, and using the hashtag #FreePink, a reference to her street artist name.  ""I'm really not ready for you to take away my hope to see Inbar come back,"" Or wrote in another post three days ago.  In November, Inbar's boyfriend, 24-year-old Noam Alon, camped for 10 days in front of the central military headquarters in Tel Aviv, calling for the Israeli government to do more to secure Inbar's release.  Of the 237 people taken hostage by Hamas and five other armed Palestinian groups during the 7 October attacks, BBC News has verified that 115 are left in Gaza. An Israeli government spokesman says 135 people remain captive. There is no official published list of hostages, so the BBC has had to confirm names itself.  Among the remaining hostages are at least 16 women and 95 men. This number includes French-Mexican Orión Hernández Radoux, the boyfriend of 22-year-old Shani Louk, who was killed after being kidnapped from the Supernova musical festival.  Soon after the festival was attacked, a video began circulating widely on social media showing the body of a young woman being paraded through the streets. Shani's family was able to identify her in the footage from her dreadlocks and distinctive tattoos. At the end of October, Shani's mother Ricarda said she had been told by the Israeli military that a piece of skull bone belonging to her daughter had been found. Shani's body has not yet been recovered. In November, her boyfriend Orión turned 31 in captivity.  ""Today is Orión's birthday,"" wrote family friend Gabriel De la Fuente on Facebook in Spanish, ""already a month since his kidnapping, may God return you well. "" Orión is believed to have been snatched at the festival, and the Sun newspaper says it has seen threatening messages written in Arabic sent from his phone.  His friends and family join together in prayer each night at 7pm, in a WhatsApp group created to help them support each other.  ""Only by uniting together in prayer will we provide the spiritual strength and support that your soul needs right now, wherever it may be,"" writes Gabriel.  Families waiting for loved ones to come home have become a great source of support to each other, says Gil Dickmann, whose cousin Carmel Gat has been captive since 7 October. ""We became like a real large family of families,"" he told the BBC News channel. ""It feels as though, when their relatives are getting released, so are mine. "" Carmel, a 39-year-old occupational therapist from Tel Aviv, had been visiting parents in Be'eri on 7 October.  Her sister in law, Yarden Roman-Gat, was released by Hamas on Wednesday, and reunited with her husband and three-year-old daughter.  ""I wasn't even sure that she was alive until I saw her,"" Gil says of Yarden.   When the 36-year-old German-Israeli, her husband and daughter were captured, they managed to break out of the gunmen's car near the Gaza-Israel barrier, Gil explains.  The family then began to run away while being shot at. Realising she couldn't run fast enough, Yarden gave her daughter to her husband and surrendered so that the others could make their escape.  ""We were very, very happy to see her,"" says Gil.  But now the ceasefire is over, Gil grows more and more scared for his cousin Carmel, who has not yet come home.  ""We were very, very worried by the fact that the truce is ended,"" Gil says. ""I'm personally very worried for her. ""  Many people whose loved ones remain hostages in Gaza have been using social media to campaign for their release, share feelings and support each other in grief.  The mother of dual US-Israeli hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin has been posting videos of herself talking about her son on his family's Bring Hersh Home Facebook page.  ""I wanted to share with you what happened last night when I woke up at 2:13 in the morning,"" Rachel told the Facebook page's 17,000 followers on Wednesday. ""I started to think about how much pain Hersh must be in. "" According to eye witnesses Rachel spoke with, Hersh lost half of his arm in a grenade explosion before he was kidnapped from the Supernova festival. Eyewitness accounts say the 23-year-old was seen being forced onto a white pick-up truck. The last-known signal from his phone came from just inside Gaza. ""It is really important that we get him home so that he can start the process of learning how to live his life in a very different way than he ever lived it before,"" says Rachel in one of her latest videos.  ""It's just another reason why we are tenaciously and tirelessly fighting for him to come home.

1679,2023-12-08 05:01:29+00:00,/news/world-67592468,"Yael Noy doesn't wear military fatigues, but she describes herself as being in battle right now, after the Hamas assault on 7 October.  ""I'm fighting to be good,"" she tells me. ""I'm fighting to stay moral when both sides are in such terrible pain. I'm fighting to be the same person I was before. ""  Yael heads a charity called Road to Recovery, a group of Israeli volunteers who drive sick Palestinians - mostly children - from checkpoints in the occupied West Bank and Gaza to hospital appointments in Israel.  Or did. The 1,000 or so volunteers can no longer take patients from Gaza, which is governed by Hamas. And four of them are dead - murdered as Palestinian gunmen stormed through their kibbutzim in southern Israel.  They include Vivian Silver, a renowned peace activist; Adi Dagan, who Yael describes as ""funny"" and always ready to step in and ferry patients at short notice in his big car; Tammy Suchman, a much-loved grandmother; and Eli Or-Gad, who loved talking about poetry.  Four other volunteers lost close family members on 7 October. About 1,200 people were killed in the Hamas attack on Israel. Since then, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says more than 17,177 people have been killed in the Israeli offensive which followed. Yael lives in northern Israel, but her parents are from kibbutz Alumim, one of the southern communities which was attacked - and they cowered as the assault unfolded, hour after terrifying hour.  Two of her nephews have been fighting in Gaza, in Israel's military response.     In the immediate aftermath of 7 October, Yael says she was so shaken that she could barely breathe.  ""Something was broken in my heart and I said that I would never talk to people in Gaza again,"" she tells me. But after a few days, she decided that she couldn't allow the atrocities to change her.  She and most of the Road to Recovery volunteers have continued to drive Palestinians from the West Bank to hospitals in Israel for cancer treatment, organ transplants and kidney dialysis. As soon as she can, she says she'll go and collect patients from Gaza again.  Yael refuses to dehumanise them, or equate them with Hamas, which is classed as a terrorist organisation in the UK and other countries. ""Like us they are victims of Hamas, so I think we should keep on helping them, because it's not their fault,"" she tells me over the phone.  ""We can't refuse to help a child with cancer. Our neighbours need help, so we need to help them. "" She worries for the families she knows in Gaza, with winter approaching and so many bombed houses now uninhabitable.   The parent of a 6-year-old child, who'd had an organ transplant, texted one of the Road to Recovery volunteers saying simply: ""We are okay. We are going to die here. "" Yael is also desperately concerned for two Road to Recovery volunteers, Oded Lifschitz and Chaim Peri, who are still being held hostage by Hamas.    Emotionally, she feels like she's being torn apart. She has uncles and cousins who are adamantly opposed to what she's doing and accuse her of helping Hamas.  And it's not just family members who disapprove. ""When I'm driving with Palestinians through checkpoints in the West Bank, soldiers have asked me how I can do what I'm doing,"" she tells me. ""Other people ask the same question. "" ""It's dangerous now to even talk about the suffering of the kids in Gaza - people look at me like I'm the enemy,"" she says, through sobs. ""But I'm not doing it for the Palestinians, I'm doing it because I want to be proud to be Israeli. I believe that whether you're an Israeli or a Palestinian, a Jew or an Arab, people are people. "" Some Palestinian families have reached out to find out how she is. But it's harder than ever now for those few people swimming against the tide by trying to bridge the divide between Israelis and Palestinians. ""Even people on the left say that we should flatten Gaza. Both sides have become more and more radicalised,"" Yael says.  ""I really don't know what will happen in the future. But I know that both of us will still live here, so we must find a solution. "" Since 7 October, some Road to Recovery volunteers have dropped out of driving altogether or decided to focus on taking medicines to displaced Israelis instead, while the war lasts. But other volunteers have stepped in, to make sure that sick Palestinians from the West Bank still get to appointments that are saving their lives. Yael says the charity will need support from the outside world to keep going because donations from within Israel have virtually stopped. But she is sure that, when it becomes possible, Road to Recovery will be collecting child patients from Gaza again - hoping that they will all have survived. ""It may be hard.  But we can't stop,"" she says. ""It's my mission and I have to do it.

1681,2023-12-12 02:16:24+00:00,/news/world-middle-east-67688422,"""When he asks me about his family I can't answer. Instead, I take a deep breath and try to avoid the question in a childlike way by changing the subject. "" Moein Abu Rezk is the only surviving relative of his four-year-old nephew, Omar, who is in a critical condition at Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in Deir al-Balah, in the central Gaza Strip. Omar had to have his left hand amputated and was left with a large, open wound on his right leg, smaller wounds on his chest and face, and a dislocated jaw following an Israeli air strike that Moein says killed 35 members of his family, including his mother, father and grandmother. So far, Moein has decided to not tell Omar about their deaths, in case it causes his condition to deteriorate before he can be medically evacuated from Gaza via Egypt, hopefully as part of an initiative by the United Arab Emirates government and the Emirates Red Crescent. ""He needs to be told the information in a specific way so that he doesn't go into shock or go into a state that I can't control,"" Moein told BBC Arabic in a series of voice notes on Sunday night.  ""He knows that he hasn't seen any of them, and yet he feels the need to ask: 'Where is mum? Where is grandma? Where did they go?'"" However, it is not guaranteed that an ambulance will transport Omar to the Egyptian border because of the intense fighting and heavy bombardment around what is known as Gaza's Middle Area. Israeli ground forces have already divided Gaza in two, fully encircling Gaza City in the first two months of the war with Hamas - which Israel, the UK and other Western powers class as a terrorist organisation.  Tanks and troops are now pushing deep into the southern city of Khan Younis. The main highway from Deir al-Balah has been declared a ""battlefield"", leaving people in the Middle Area with only one supposedly safe evacuation route along the Mediterranean coast. Many Palestinians living in the north of Gaza sought refuge in the Middle Area after the Israeli military ordered them to evacuate their homes and move south of the Wadi Gaza river two months ago.  That order came at the start of the war triggered by a cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October in which 1,200 people were killed and about 240 others were taken hostage. Since then, more than18,200 people have been killed in Gaza according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Omar is among the more than 49,000 other people so far reported injured. The Israeli military says its forces are operating to eliminate terrorists, locate weaponry and destroy terrorist infrastructure, and that more than 22,000 targets have been struck since the start of the war. Moein told BBC Arabic that Omar and his family had been visiting his grandmother's house in Nuseirat camp, just to the north of Deir al-Balah, when it was bombed without any prior warning from the Israeli military.  ""We have never seen missiles like that before. The missile falls and destroys the whole residential area around it,"" he recalled. ""Luckily, the house had an opening through which [Omar] fell. But his left arm was [so badly] injured that it had to be amputated immediately.  ""[On Saturday], he lost about three units of blood and his haemoglobin [concentration] fell from 9.5 to 7.4, so he had to be transferred to surgery for a blood transfer. ""  Moein said the situation at the hospital was so bad that doctors could not find a bed for Omar despite the severity of his injuries, forcing him to wait in a corridor while doctors and nurses treated him as best as they could. ""All medical equipment and tools are so limited to the extent that the we have to deal with the situation in a more practical rather than a healthy way. ""There are no painkillers so we have to joke around and try to make him laugh in order to calm him. "" Moein conceded that this method only worked some of the time but added: ""We don't have any other option. "" He said he hoped that Omar would be transported next Thursday to the Rafah border crossing with Egypt and then taken to a hospital for specialist treatment.  Lena Shakora, her husband and three young sons have so far survived the Israeli bombardment, but she said they were still living a ""nightmare"". They fled their home in the Sheikh Radwan district of Gaza City and are currently sheltering in a house in an agricultural area outside Deir al-Balah with their relatives. ""I wake up every day remembering that we are at war [and] people are starving. Its torture to be displaced from your house and find no food,"" Lena told BBC Arabic on Sunday night.  ""My family and I are sitting with 40 individuals in one room and all the windows are [blown out] because of the bombing. We are basically sitting outdoors. . . and it is very cold and people are humiliated. "" Lena said her sons had hurt their backs because they were having to carry containers of water. And to make matters worse, the water is not clean because treatment plants and pumps are not working because of a lack of fuel. The family was also being forced to eat contaminated food because shops were empty and they had not received any aid, she added.  ""Our greatest hope is to have flour so that we can bake, and even that we can bake it on [clean] wood. ""  ""People go around collecting whatever wood they can find. But the bread comes out contaminated because it is cooked on wood from the scene of a bombing,"" she explained. The UN said on Sunday that it had been unable to distribute outside the southern city of Rafah, on the border with Egypt, in recent days because of the intensity of hostilities and restrictions on movement.

Samer Abudaqa was wounded in the strike on a school in Khan Younis on Friday along with his colleague, Wael Al-Dahdouh. Al Jazeera said Abudaqa bled to death because a heavy bombardment prevented paramedics from reaching him. The Qatar-based network said it had referred the case to the International Criminal Court (ICC). Posting on X, formerly known as Twitter, Al Jazeera referred to Abudaqa's death as an ""assassination"", and said that its legal filing to the ICC would include repeated attacks on network crews working in the Palestinian territories. The network said Abudaqa was its 13th journalist to die on duty since it was created in 1996. Dahdouh, who lost several family members in an earlier Israeli bombing, survived the attack. During his eulogy at this colleague's funeral, Dahdouh said journalists in Gaza would ""continue to do our duty with professionalism and transparency"". He said that journalists in Gaza were carrying a ""human and noble message"" for the world amid the ongoing war and would continue to work despite Israeli attacks. According to Al Jazeera, Dahdouh was hit by shrapnel on his upper arm and managed to walk to Nasser hospital for treatment. Abudaqa also suffered shrapnel injuries, but paramedics struggled reach him as the area was under heavy bombardment from Israeli forces. Al Jazeera said the cameraman was ""left to bleed to death for over five hours,"" adding it held Israel accountable for targeting its journalists and their families. Abudaqa joined Al Jazeera in June 2004, working as a cameraman and editor.  He had three sons and a daughter, and lived in the town of Abasan al-Kabira near Khan Younis. Al Jazeera's managing editor, Mohamed Moawad, described Abudaqa as ""a skilled professional but a compassionate soul who understood the power of visual storytelling"".  ""His unwavering commitment to truth and storytelling has left an indelible mark on our team,"" he said on X. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), at least 64 journalists - mostly Palestinians - have been killed since the Israel-Gaza conflict began on 7 October. The Foreign Press Association (FPA), which represents several hundred journalists working for international news organisations, said it grieved the cameraman's death. saying he was the first FPA member to be killed in the Israel-Gaza conflict.

Azaiza, who has more than 17 million Instagram followers, was recently named ""man of the year"" by GQ Middle East for his work covering the Israel-Gaza war. Akse P19, who painted the mural in Manchester, said it was ""dedicated to all journalists reporting from Gaza"".  Ali Yousef, who commissioned the work, said it had had ""positive"" reactions. The restaurant owner said Greater Manchester's Palestinian community had been ""left helpless and quite hopeless"" by what was happening, so ""got together and said we needed to commend those who are conveying news from within Gaza"". He said the restrictions on communication in Gaza meant that ""without them, we would have zero journalism, because there is no internet"". He added that he had developed a respect for Akse P19 after seeing his murals around Manchester and he and his wife approached the artist to design a mural ""thinking he was not going to respond, but he got back and agreed"". Akse P19, who declined to be interviewed, has previously created murals of footballer Marcus Rashford and suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst and painted the work in Burnage over a depiction of Uma Thurman he created at the same site in 2018. In a post on Instagram, he said the war had been ""the deadliest period for journalists covering conflicts since [Committee to Protect Journalists] records began in 1992"". ""This mural is dedicated to all journalists reporting from Gaza right now,"" he added. At least 64 media workers have been killed while covering the conflict, which began in October.

It's another night in the tense gloom outside the accident and emergency department.  Medical personnel in scrubs are poised to receive more casualties. Voices are raised and men crowd around. Public order is starting to break down - people are traumatised and exhausted. A car pulls up, its horn blaring and lights flashing. A young man is pulled out and put onto a stretcher, then rushed inside.  Then another car arrives, covered in dust, and a child who is only four or five is helped out. He is able to walk. Hospitals in Khan Younis - the Gaza Strip's second largest city - have been overwhelmed since the Israeli air force intensified its bombardment of the south on Friday. Israeli tanks and troops have also now entered the city, after the ground offensive was widened following the collapse of a temporary truce with Hamas. Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says at least 1,200 people have been killed across the territory since the fighting resumed. That has brought to more than 16,000 the total number killed in Gaza during the war, which was triggered by Hamas's attacks on southern Israel on 7 October.  Gunmen from Hamas - a proscribed terrorist organisation in Israel, the UK, US and EU - killed at least 1,200 people and took more than 240 back to Gaza as hostages. Many of Gaza's 2.3 million residents sought refuge in the south after the Israeli military ordered civilians to leave the north in the early days of the war. But with the fighting spreading to Khan Younis, they're running out of places to flee to. Thousands of displaced people are crammed inside the grounds and corridors of the city's European Hospital. ""When we are playing and there is bombardment, we immediately run to the tents near the walls and [pretend to be] asleep,"" says one of the children there as the sounds of explosions fill the air. ""We are afraid. The glass of windows shatters above us. "" A woman at the hospital says she fled to al-Fakhari, an area east of Khan Younis, after receiving phone calls telling them that it was a ""safe zone"". But now, she says, the area is being bombarded and the situation is ""very bad"". ""I don't see any area being safe when it comes to us, nor is any area habitable. "" A 75-year-old man agrees that nowhere is safe. ""The situation is indescribable. There are children and women. We, as elderly, can withstand what is happening,"" he says. ""Listen to the ongoing sounds - how could someone sit and wait for the opportunity to leave a safe zone? Where is the safety? We can't sense it. Every place we go to, they say it is safe but we can't find that. "" In downtown Khan Younis, Samah Ilwan waves two empty water bottles in the air and says her six children - five girls and one boy - are thirsty. ""We have become like cats and dogs. Perhaps cats and dogs get shelters. We don't have any. We're stranded in the street. "" Life is also closing in on me.  Despite everything that has happened to me and my family since the start of the war, this is the first time that I feel completely lost. All willpower and control have been ripped from me.  I'm used to keeping my family safe and secure, coming up with a plan. Now, I am torn by indecision.  I'm originally from the north but I fled south with my family after being ordered to do so by the Israeli army, who said the south was ""safe"". Currently, I am alone in Khan Younis, while my family is in central Gaza.  I was able to travel up to see them every few days. But now, the Israelis have shut one road and the second one is very dangerous. Should I go south to Rafah, keep working and hope that my family will be ok?  Or should I try to get back to them, stop reporting, and if it comes to the worst, then at least we die together? I hope no-one else ever has to face this awful choice, which is not a choice at all.",BBC reporter in Gaza: People here are traumatised and exhausted,BBC reporter in Gaza: People here are traumatised and exhausted,"israel,israel-gaza_war,hamas",http://bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-67643746,articles/article_1684.txt,results/article_1684.txt.json
1685,2023-12-18 22:27:45+00:00,/news/business-67748605,"Oil giant BP will pause all shipments of oil through the Red Sea after recent attacks on vessels by Houthi rebels. The firm blamed the ""deteriorating security situation"" in the region as Iran-backed Houthis target ships they believe are bound for Israel. Many freight firms have suspended journeys as the attacks continue. Following BP's announcement the US said it would lead an international naval operation to protect ships along the route. Countries joining the security group include the UK, Canada, France, Bahrain, Norway and Spain.  In a statement, US defence secretary Lloyd Austin said: ""The recent escalation in reckless Houthi attacks originating from Yemen threatens the free flow of commerce, endangers innocent mariners, and violates international law. "" BP said it would keep its ""precautionary pause under ongoing review"" and monitor the region. Analysts suggested that if other large oil firms follow suit, oil prices could rise. Oil prices were higher on Monday, with international benchmark Brent trading up 2.6% to almost $79 a barrel. ""Right now it's unclear how significant the impact will be,"" said Gregory Brew, an oil historian and analyst at Eurasia Group. ""Though if more shipping companies divert their traffic, and if the disruption lasts more than a week or two, prices are likely to climb further. "" The Red Sea is one of the world's most important routes for oil and liquefied natural gas shipments, as well as for consumer goods. Analysis by S&P Global Market Intelligence found that nearly 15% of goods imported into Europe, the Middle East and North Africa were shipped from Asia and the Gulf by sea. That includes 21.5% of refined oil and more than 13% of crude oil. ""Consumer goods will face the largest impact, though current disruptions are occurring during the off-peak shipping season,"" said Chris Rogers from S&P Global Market Intelligence. On Monday, one of the world's largest shipping firms said it would no longer carry Israeli cargo via the Red Sea. In an update seen by the BBC, Evergreen Line, said: ""For the safety of ships and crew, Evergreen Line has decided to temporarily stop accepting Israeli cargo with immediate effect, and has instructed its container ships to suspend navigation through the Red Sea until further notice. "" The Houthi rebels are targeting ships travelling through the Bab al-Mandab Strait - also known as the Gate of Tears - which is a channel 20 miles (32km) wide, and known for being perilous to navigate. The rebels have declared their support for Hamas and have said they are targeting ships travelling to Israel, using drones and rockets against foreign-owned vessels. Instead of using the Bab al-Mandab Strait, ships will now have to take a longer route navigating around southern Africa, potentially adding about 10 days to the journey and costing millions of dollars. Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza following the 7 October attacks by Hamas that killed 1,200 people. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said more than 18,700 have been killed since the start of the war. It is not clear if all the ships Houthi rebels have attacked were actually heading to Israel. In the most recent reported assault, the owner of the MT Swan Atlantic said the ship was hit by an ""unidentified object"" on Monday while in the Red Sea off Yemen despite there being no links to Israel.  Inventor Chemical Tankers said: ""For the record, there is no Israeli link in the ownership (Norwegian), technical management (Singapore) of the vessel nor in any parts of the logistical chain for the cargo transported. "" Attacks on ships have intensified in recent days, leading to shipping firms suspending travel through the strait which sits between Yemen on the Arabian Peninsula and Djibouti and Eritrea on the African coast. It is the route by which ships can reach the Suez Canal from the south - itself a major shipping lane. Maersk, the world's second-biggest shipping firm, described the situation as ""alarming"" on Friday after a ""near-miss"" incident involving Maersk Gibraltar and another attack on a container ship. It was followed by Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC), the world's largest shipping group, which said it would also divert its ships from the area. Its container ship, MSC PALATIUM III, was attacked on Friday as it was transiting the Red Sea. There were no injuries to the crew, but the ship has been taken out of service. CMA-CGM has also stopped shipments through the region, and Reuters has reported that Belgian oil tanker firm Euronav and Norway-based tanker group Frontline would both avoid Red Sea routes. On Monday, Inventor Chemical Tankers confirmed that the MT Swan Atlantic was targeted while travelling from France to Réunion Island in the Indian Ocean. The company said there were no injuries to its Indian crew, adding that the ""crew and the ship are now assisted by the US navy and will be brought to safety under protection by naval forces"". Germany's Hapag-Lloyd said it was re-routing several ships via the Cape of Good Hope, until passage through the Red Sea ""will be safe again for vessels and their crews"".  Evergreen Line said that any container ships on longer journeys between Asia and the Mediterranean, Europe or the east coast of the US would also be diverted around the Cape of Good Hope. Peter Sand, chief analyst at freight rate data company Xeneta, said shipping firms would now be contacting customers to let them know that cargo was being delayed, adding that there was ""definitely a price to pay for a situation like this"". He said the industry would also face knock-on effects such as higher insurance premiums, but he said that it was in a much better position to deal with an unfolding crisis than it was when the huge Ever Given ship blocked the Suez Canal in 2021, with Covid-related supply chain issues having eased up. Sue Terpilowski of the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport also pointed out that in addition to extra fuel costs and time, the war-risk insurance costs are going up ""exponentially"", with customers facing higher prices being passed on to them too.

1686,2023-12-13 23:40:22+00:00,/news/world-us-canada-67711250,"The families of US hostages held by Hamas say they believe President Joe Biden is doing everything he can to secure the release of their loved ones.  The administration is ""completely committed"" to getting them home, one relative said after meeting Mr Biden. There are believed to be eight Americans still held in Gaza. The meeting came a day after Mr Biden said Israel is starting to lose global support over its ""indiscriminate bombing"" of the enclave. This was the first in-person meeting family members of US hostages had with the president after a first virtual meeting in October.  Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Deputy National Security Adviser Jon Finer were also in attendance.  After the meeting, thirteen relatives held up photos of their loved ones as they spoke to the press outside the White House.  Jonathan Dekel-Chen, father of 35-year-old hostage Sagui Dekel-Chen, said they came away with the feeling that they ""could have no better friend in Washington or in the White House than President Biden himself and his administration"".  The meeting came as Mr Biden faces scrutiny over his strongest criticism yet of Israel's leadership, made on Tuesday during a fundraising event.  The president said that while Israel ""has most of the world"" supporting it, ""they're starting to lose that support by the indiscriminate bombing that takes place"". He also said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu must ""change"", adding that ""this government in Israel is making it very difficult"". Mr Biden has offered unwavering public support to the country since Hamas launched its attacks on 7 October. His remarks align with his administration's recent approach to the war, with officials urging Israel to ""put a premium on human life"". On Wednesday, the White House said Mr Biden's remarks ""reflected the reality of global opinion"".  ""Our support for Israel is not diminished,"" White House security spokesman John Kirby said at a press conference.  ""But we have had concerns and we have expressed those concerns about the prosecution of this military campaign, even while acknowledging that it's Hamas that started this. "" Mr Kirby added: ""It's reflective of our constant efforts to urge the Israelis to be as precise and careful as possible"". Hamas broke through Israel's heavily guarded perimeter on 7 October, killing 1,200 people and taking 240 hostages - some of whom were released during a brief truce The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says 18,600 people have been killed and 50,000 injured in the enclave since the start of the war. Mr Kirby did not go into detail on what Mr Biden meant when he said Mr Netanyahu must ""change"", saying: ""It's not for us to to dictate terms to a foreign sovereign government. "" On Tuesday, Mr Netanyahu said Israel had received the ""full backing"" of the US for its ground war as well as its goal of destroying Hamas and recovering hostages. ""Yes, there is disagreement about 'the day after Hamas' and I hope that we will reach [an] agreement here as well,"" he said. Meanwhile, families of some other Americans detained abroad stood outside the White House on Wednesday as the president hosted relatives of hostages in Gaza.  They said the administration has ignored repeated pleas for a meeting. ""We're glad the president is meeting with the [families of] the Gaza hostages, but when he tells all of our families - or his staff tells all of our families - that we're the highest priority, these actions clearly don't point to that,"" Harrison Li, whose father, Kai Li, has been detained in China since 2012, told CBS News, the BBC's US partner.

1687,2023-12-01 16:15:23+00:00,/news/world-us-canada-67586033,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has clearly laid out benchmarks for the protection of civilians in Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza.  In the strongest and most specific US remarks yet, Mr Blinken said he'd told the Israeli government that it must avoid further mass displacement of Palestinians and damage to critical infrastructure, like hospitals, power stations and water facilities.  He did not, however, appear to set down red lines that would trigger US actions.  The secretary of state travelled to Israel to deliver the message - his fourth visit since the conflict began - at a time when hostilities have been paused by a deal to release hostages captured by Hamas.  Mr Blinken accepted that Israel planned to resume its military operation, but he also ""underscored the imperative for the United States that the massive loss of civilian life and displacement of the scale that we saw in northern Gaza not be repeated in the south"". Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October killed 1,200 people with around 240 others taken hostage. Since then, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says Israel has killed more than 14,800 Palestinians in its retaliatory campaign, including about 6,000 children.  Israeli military strikes have hit hospitals and schools and rendered northern Gaza a moonscape of destruction.  The unfolding devastation has shifted the approach of President Joe Biden's administration, from unequivocal support for Israel right after the attack, to a growing emphasis on civilian protection and a focus on alleviating the desperate humanitarian conditions in Gaza.   That evolution has been propelled by anger from Arab allies, and significant dissent to Mr Biden's policies within the administration itself. Senior officials had been previewing Mr Blinken's message for a more surgical approach when Israel focuses its offensive on southern Gaza, where more than 1.5 million Palestinians have fled to escape bombing in the north.  Further displacement of Palestinians would be ""beyond the capacity of any humanitarian support network to cope with"", said one.  He clarified that safe zones needed to involve multiple places near UN facilities and shelters, not a single area for the mass relocation of civilians, as initially proposed by the Israeli government.  They will be more like neighbourhood de-confliction zones, said another official after Mr Blinken's meetings.   The secretary of state also underlined that there must be room to sustain and build on the humanitarian assistance getting into Gaza.  But he avoided a question about whether he'd imposed a timeline for the military operation, stating instead that Israel agreed with the US approach.  He said Washington supported Israel's goal to neutralise the threat posed by Hamas, and highlighted the complexity of such a task when the Palestinian militants are embedded amongst the civilian population.  Earlier this week the administration clarified that it was not prepared to use its ultimate leverage - placing conditions on America's massive military assistance to Israel - which is powering the war.  This is what a dozen or so Democratic senators were told when they questioned whether Israel's use of the weaponry complied with American law, according to one who attended a meeting with the National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan.  A senior US official said threatening aid to Israel was not an effective approach, but its leaders pay attention to what the US says.   The emphasis has been for President Biden to use his influence as Israel's strongest ally to privately push Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on humanitarian issues.  Mr Blinken has been unusually public about this.  The next phase of the war will reveal whether Israel has got the message.

1688,2023-12-02 00:59:38+00:00,/news/world-middle-east-67579364,"In the end it was a diplomatic achievement that the ceasefire lasted as long as it did. Now, after a seven-day pause, Israel and Hamas are facing their greatest military and political challenges.  For Hamas, it is the fight to survive. As long as a Hamas gunman can pull a trigger or launch a rocket into Israel it will claim to be undefeated.  For all its overwhelming military power, Israel's task is more complicated.  Its Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu swore ""mighty vengeance"" after Hamas breached the border and killed around 1,200 people, mostly Israeli civilians, on 7 October.  In the first hours after the Israeli military went back on the offensive, the government recommitted itself to its war aims in a WhatsApp post: ""Releasing the hostages, eliminating Hamas and ensuring that Gaza never again constitutes a threat to the residents of Israel. "" How it does that and what happens next are now the number one preoccupations of Mr Netanyahu, his political allies and enemies in Israel and Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state who has made four trips to Israel and the region since the war started. Perhaps Mr Blinken knew that his attempt to prolong what he called the ""humanitarian pause"" would fail.  On the evening before the fighting resumed, he repeated America's support for Israel's right to defend itself, and once again condemned Hamas.  Mr Blinken repeated his insistence ""that Israel act in accordance with international humanitarian law and the laws of war, even when confronting a terrorist group that respects neither"". Then Mr Blinken made his starkest public statement yet about how Israel should fight the war.  It is worth quoting at length, because it is a checklist of what the US expects from its closest ally.   Mr Blinken said that it meant ""taking more effective steps to protect the lives of civilians, including by clearly and precisely designating areas and places in southern and central Gaza where they can be safe and out of the line of fire"". ""It means avoiding further significant displacement of civilians inside of Gaza.  It means avoiding damage to life-critical infrastructure, like hospitals, like power stations, like water facilities. "" ""And it means giving civilians who've been displaced to southern Gaza the choice to return to the north as soon as conditions permit.  There must be no enduring internal displacement. "" At the beginning of the war Joe Biden, the US president, came here. While trying to wrap Israel in a warm and powerful embrace he also warned his allies not to be blinded by rage as they sought justice, as America had been after the al-Qaeda attacks of 11 September, 2001.  Mr Blinken's remarks suggest Joe Biden believes that Mr Netanyahu, with whom he has had a difficult relationship, did not listen.  Israel's war aims require that the next phase of its offensive is aimed at Hamas in southern Gaza. When it invaded northern Gaza, it ordered Palestinian civilians to head to the south for their own safety.  While not as lethal as the north, much of which Israel has turned into a wasteland, nowhere in Gaza is safe.  A few hours after hostilities resumed, Palestinians in Rafah, in the far south of Gaza on the border with Egypt, were being killed in Israeli air strikes.  Israel cannot claim to have eliminated Hamas without destroying its infrastructure in the south, where it believes Yahya Sinwar and the other leaders are lying low in tunnels under the civilian population, along with an unspecified number of fighting men. If Israel is going to use the same tactics as it did in northern Gaza, thousands more civilians will be killed. Antonio Guterres, the UN secretary-general, already calls the plight of the people of Gaza ""an epic humanitarian catastrophe"".  Egypt, and others, fear that extreme military pressure on approaching two million civilians in the south could mean thousands of desperate people forcing their way over the border into the Sinai Desert. A new Palestinian refugee crisis would be another dangerous and desperate moment for the Middle East.  Let us assume that Israel has promised the US that Palestinian civilians will be told to move to specific areas where they will be safe. In a high-intensity war of the kind that Israel has been waging, with tanks, air strikes and heavy artillery, it is far easier to see how that plan might go wrong, rather than how it might succeed. If Israel shifts to lighter counter-insurgency tactics, with troops moving without a blanket of heavy protection, it will most likely suffer many more battle casualties than it has so far. Israel's next moves are also a significant moment for Joe Biden, who is facing strident criticism of his support for Israel from the progressive wing of his own Democratic party.  Biden's chief diplomat, Antony Blinken, has spoken clearly, in public, about the way the US wants Israel to fight Hamas. If Israel kills anything like as many Palestinian civilians as it did in the north, in defiance of the stated will of Joe Biden, the US president will have to decide whether he can continue to give Israel so much support, not just on the battlefield but also in the United Nations Security Council, where the US has used its veto many times to protect Israel.   Hamas is not beaten. Its remaining hostages give it a powerful lever that it can use to disrupt Israel's military campaign, and to inflict more psychological pressure on the home front. The Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and his men will also try to exploit opportunities that open up if and when Israel's generals follow American instructions to use less firepower.  This war is in a new phase. So is the whole region. Many Palestinians and Israelis, including those far from the battles in Gaza, seem beaten down by the weight of a dangerous and uncertain future.",Bowen: US sets clearer red lines for Israel as ceasefire ends,Bowen: US sets clearer red lines for Israel as ceasefire ends,"israel,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-67579364,articles/article_1688.txt,results/article_1688.txt.json
1689,2023-12-08 20:54:29+00:00,/news/world-middle-east-67664804,"UN secretary general António Guterres has spoken about the ""serious risk to the maintenance of international peace and security"" in the Gaza conflict, citing the spillover of hostilities in ""the occupied West Bank, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen"". He triggered Article 99, prompting a UN Security Council vote on Friday, because he believes this is a very urgent matter which must be brought to the attention of the council.  The Israeli government detests the UN and they detest the secretary general.  The Israelis rejected his description, claiming Mr Guterres is in fact the threat to world peace because he is pandering to Hamas by trying to end the fighting now, before their mission to destroy the group has been concluded.  That ill-feeling will not have improved after the secretary general also mentioned that one of the risks is that the situation in Gaza could get so bad that there would be a mass displacement of Palestinians over the border into Egypt - which is also of huge concern to the Egyptian government.  There was, Mr Guterres said, a high risk of the ""total collapse of the humanitarian support system in Gaza"". And the Palestinians say that is exactly what Israel wants because it wants to get all Palestinians out of Gaza.  Journalists are not permitted by Israel to enter Gaza so I can't report from there myself, but what the secretary general is saying sounds pretty accurate from the pictures and video we can see and the people we speak to.  By all the measures you can think of, the situation there for civilians is absolutely catastrophic, as they are subjected to a remorseless military campaign. Israel says they are doing what they can to save civilian lives but insists Hamas holds responsibility for using them as human shields. At the UN, the Americans duly vetoed this resolution calling for a ceasefire. For those concerned about the significant loss of life, that does sound a bit hollow - the Americans claim the Israelis are saying they will stick to the rules of war and avoid unnecessary civilian deaths. But, they say, there is a gap between what Israel says and what it does.  I think the strategy behind the secretary general's decision to bring a vote - which he knew would probably get vetoed - was to hurry up the inevitable moment when the Americans will say to Israel: ""Enough is enough, you've had enough time and killed enough people and it's time for a ceasefire. "" Some diplomats I have spoken to have said they might give the Israelis another month - I think Mr Guterres's strategy is to try and shorten that, partly by increasing international pressure and also partly by shaming the Americans into thinking that they cannot continue to hold this position as it becomes less and less tenable.  That pressure has also increased today with the publication of footage of prisoners in Gaza, held by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), stripped to their underwear and being driven away in trucks. It's a cruel image of war seeing these men, which local reports on social media suggest could be as many as 700.  Those same sources, including family of some of the men, say that they were taken from a UN school where they were sheltering, and where others tried to get away and were killed.  A horrendous video circulated yesterday of six people lying dead in the street - said to be from that same area and near that same school - and one of them was a bloody corpse lying on top of a white flag he had apparently been carrying.  The IDF say they are trying to work out who is a suspect and who is responsible for those terrible attacks on 7 October - and that they are all the while observing the international law on conflict.  But for those who have little sympathy for what Israel is doing, or have lost sympathy because of the level of killing that has been carried out in Gaza, those people are saying that this is another sign of Israeli indifference to the dignity and the health of Palestinians.  The weather is chilly here now, so being forced to walk around in underwear in streets, some blindfolded as we saw in the video, and some with their hands tied behind their back, is undoubtedly unpleasant.  The Israelis say they can't avoid it - others say it's pretty savage.",Bowen: US uses veto but pressure for Gaza ceasefire is building,Bowen: US uses veto but pressure for Gaza ceasefire is building,"israel,israel-gaza_war,hamas",http://bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-67664804,articles/article_1689.txt,results/article_1689.txt.json

Beyond it, comfortable sofas piled with cushions are screened off from the rest of the room. It's a safe, private corner where survivors of the Nova music festival can be with others who went through the same ordeal on 7 October, and get the mental health support many of them desperately need. More than 360 young partygoers were shot, beaten or burnt to death by Hamas attackers, who stormed the festival site near the Israel-Gaza perimeter fence early that morning. Another 40 were taken hostage.  First, social media posts showed panicked crowds fleeing from rockets fired from Gaza and gunmen on the ground. Later, distressing videos from first responders began to confirm the scale of the massacre, as they filmed scores of murdered partygoers. In the following days, Dr Lia Naor realised that - unlike those who'd been evacuated from their nearby kibbutzim - the young people from the festival who lived through the ordeal didn't have a community already around them to give support.  So she built one.  ""I just wanted them to be held,"" Dr Naor explains.  ""They were so fragmented and so frozen. Then there was the brokenness of faith that they that had felt - there'd been nobody there for them, not their parents, not the army, not the police. Nobody was there to save them. So the first thing was just getting them to feel secure and in a healing space. ""  The outdoor setting in Rishpon, north of Tel Aviv, is sheltered and peaceful. The early December days have been warm in Israel, and people sit on colourful beanbags scattered across the grass. A timetable is propped up showing the range of workshops that day, from mosaic making to sound baths. There's massage, group music, and singing sessions.  A few placid dogs roam through the group, waiting to be stroked or begging for food. One tiny, black-haired crossbreed chihuahua has a pair of silver wings on its back, drawing coos of appreciation. It's a different scene from the early days. ""Even though their bodies were whole, we saw how broken they were and that their eyes were hollow,"" Lia remembers. ""They didn't look alive. They couldn't look at us. They would shake, they couldn't eat, they couldn't drink. The evil that these people met is incomprehensible.  ""I told them early on, 'As dark the darkness is that you saw, we're going to bring the light. We're going to help you believe in yourselves and in others again. '"" This place is a huge collective effort, but it hasn't been driven by the state.  Everybody here is a volunteer giving their time for free and hoping to heal themselves too. The homemade food spread out on low tables is donated by charities and businesses. Everyone wants to do something to help in the aftermath of one of Israel's darkest moments. Lior Gelbaum is a Nova survivor. I compliment her on the tiny jewels she's stuck under each eye, sparkling in the light, and she tells me they make her feel festive again. The 24-year-old from the city of Petah Tikva is coming here regularly to get support and give out handmade silver necklaces to others who were there that day.  She remembers it well. ""At 06:30 in the morning, we started hearing rockets flying above our heads,"" she tells me. ""We know the drill, so we got into our car and started driving away, but there was a traffic jam. We started hearing gunshots above our heads, so we got out and just started running towards the open field. We didn't know where we were going or what was happening, we just heard automatic gunshots all around us. Two people, Yehuda and Galit, had a big car and got us inside it and away. They saved us. "" Lior also talks about the importance of music to her healing process.  ""Everyone that was at the Nova festival, we love to dance, we love to be together.

Beyond it, comfortable sofas piled with cushions are screened off from the rest of the room. It's a safe, private corner where survivors of the Nova music festival can be with others who went through the same ordeal on 7 October, and get the mental health support many of them desperately need. More than 360 young partygoers were shot, beaten or burnt to death by Hamas attackers, who stormed the festival site near the Israel-Gaza perimeter fence early that morning. Another 40 were taken hostage.  First, social media posts showed panicked crowds fleeing from rockets fired from Gaza and gunmen on the ground. Later, distressing videos from first responders began to confirm the scale of the massacre, as they filmed scores of murdered partygoers. In the following days, Dr Lia Naor realised that - unlike those who'd been evacuated from their nearby kibbutzim - the young people from the festival who lived through the ordeal didn't have a community already around them to give support.  So she built one.  ""I just wanted them to be held,"" Dr Naor explains.  ""They were so fragmented and so frozen. Then there was the brokenness of faith that they that had felt - there'd been nobody there for them, not their parents, not the army, not the police. Nobody was there to save them. So the first thing was just getting them to feel secure and in a healing space. ""  The outdoor setting in Rishpon, north of Tel Aviv, is sheltered and peaceful. The early December days have been warm in Israel, and people sit on colourful beanbags scattered across the grass. A timetable is propped up showing the range of workshops that day, from mosaic making to sound baths. There's massage, group music, and singing sessions.  A few placid dogs roam through the group, waiting to be stroked or begging for food. One tiny, black-haired crossbreed chihuahua has a pair of silver wings on its back, drawing coos of appreciation. It's a different scene from the early days. ""Even though their bodies were whole, we saw how broken they were and that their eyes were hollow,"" Lia remembers. ""They didn't look alive. They couldn't look at us. They would shake, they couldn't eat, they couldn't drink. The evil that these people met is incomprehensible.  ""I told them early on, 'As dark the darkness is that you saw, we're going to bring the light. We're going to help you believe in yourselves and in others again. '"" This place is a huge collective effort, but it hasn't been driven by the state.  Everybody here is a volunteer giving their time for free and hoping to heal themselves too. The homemade food spread out on low tables is donated by charities and businesses. Everyone wants to do something to help in the aftermath of one of Israel's darkest moments. Lior Gelbaum is a Nova survivor. I compliment her on the tiny jewels she's stuck under each eye, sparkling in the light, and she tells me they make her feel festive again. The 24-year-old from the city of Petah Tikva is coming here regularly to get support and give out handmade silver necklaces to others who were there that day.  She remembers it well. ""At 06:30 in the morning, we started hearing rockets flying above our heads,"" she tells me. ""We know the drill, so we got into our car and started driving away, but there was a traffic jam. We started hearing gunshots above our heads, so we got out and just started running towards the open field. We didn't know where we were going or what was happening, we just heard automatic gunshots all around us. Two people, Yehuda and Galit, had a big car and got us inside it and away. They saved us. "" Lior also talks about the importance of music to her healing process.  ""Everyone that was at the Nova festival, we love to dance, we love to be together. After the massacre happened, it was important for the community to get back together and to strengthen each other, to be with each other and talk and feel our emotions. "" But she says she's been struggling to enjoy something which is a huge part of her identity.

1693,2023-12-15 09:28:24+00:00,/news/uk-67720176,"British-Palestinian families have urged the government to create a visa scheme for stranded relatives in Gaza. A letter, sent to Foreign Secretary David Cameron on behalf of 80 families, calls for a scheme similar to the Ukraine Family Scheme visa. A petition on Parliament's website calling for a new visa scheme also has more than 22,700 signatures. The government said it was ""working around the clock"" to get those ""who want to leave"" out of Gaza. More than 270 British nationals and their dependants have left Gaza so far, it added in a statement to the BBC.  British nationals currently need to apply for visas for their spouses, partners and children who are in Gaza through the existing family visa route, before they come to the UK. British children under the age of 18 can also sponsor their parents for a visa.  This visa route carries fees - someone outside the UK wanting to join their British spouse, for example, generally needs to pay £1,840. There is also a health surcharge to pay on top of that, which is at least £1,560 for adults.  Relatives such as siblings, parents of adult children and extended family, are not eligible in most cases. The Ukraine Family Scheme was set up in March 2022 after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, to allow people fleeing the war in Ukraine to move to the UK to join family members. This can be either an immediate or extended family member, including a parent of an adult child.  It is free to apply to the Ukraine Family Scheme, and additional fees such as the health surcharge are waived. About 71,400 visas have been issued under the scheme so far.  The letter, co-written and signed by British citizens and residents with family members in Gaza, calls for an equivalent scheme to be set up for Palestinians. ""While acknowledging the complexities of each conflict, it is disheartening for us, as British citizens and UK residents, to witness the disparity in our government response,"" it said. Not having a specific visa scheme for Palestinians, the letter said, ""stands in stark contrast to the swift and supportive actions taken in similar circumstances, such as in the Ukrainian conflict"". Palestinians in the UK ""are currently feeling a profound sense of abandonment and neglect"" as a result, it said. One of the people who signed the letter, Ibrahim Assaliya, told BBC News that his 71-year-old mother is trapped alone in Jabalia refugee camp in Gaza. ""It's a horrible situation,"" he said. ""The shelling and bombardment. . . she's been asked two times to leave her house to go to another place. But she can't do it, because she's disabled. "" He added that ""it's miserable there - there's no food, no water. They're starving"". Dr Assaliya, his wife and five children - all British nationals - were visiting his mother in Gaza when the war broke out.  They were eventually able to evacuate through the Rafah crossing last month, but this meant leaving Dr Assaliya's mother behind.  In a statement sent to the BBC, the government said: ""We are working at pace to support British families who have crossed the border into Egypt, making sure any dependants who need a visa can apply for one and that appropriate checks are carried out in a timely manner.

1694,2023-12-08 10:24:04+00:00,/news/uk-england-lancashire-67658194,"A council has passed a motion calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. Burnley Council voted for the move to ""stop the mass killing of civilians in the Israel-Gaza conflict"".  A seven-day truce, which had seen humanitarian assistance reaching the Gaza Strip, ended on 1 December. Council leader Afrasiab Anwar said: ""This is not a Muslim issue. It is a humanitarian issue. Every single one of us needs to speak out. "" Eleven councillors quit Labour over Sir Keir Starmer's decision not to push for a ceasefire in Gaza and formed a coalition with the Greens and Lib Dems in November.  Burnley Council's motion to call for a ceasefire was proposed by councillor Lubna Khan and seconded by Green group leader Scott Cunliffe. The Conservative group abstained, while Labour councillors had a free vote, with some, including group leader Mark Townsend abstaining.  Former council executive members Sue Graham and John Harbour voted against the motion.  Hamas attacked Israel in October, killing 1,200 people and taking 240 hostages, some of whom were released during a short-lived truce. Hamas officials in Gaza said Israel has killed more than 17,000 people in its retaliatory campaign, including about 7,000 children. The council motion also called for the opening of aid corridors into Gaza, the United Nations and International Criminal Court appointing arbitrators to assess evidence of war crimes and the establishment of a recognised and sovereign Palestine alongside a secure and sovereign Israel. Former councillor Bea Foster, who was on a Burnley Women for Peace pilgrimage to the Holy Land when the conflict broke out, told the meeting before the debate: ""To challenge the Israeli government on the issue of the illegal occupation is not anti-Semitic. "" Councillor Shah Hussain said: ""Everyone has seen footage of what can only be described as genocide and wiping out a particular race of people. ""There are extremists on both sides. When we call out Hamas, and rightly so, we need to call out the Israeli terrorists who are killing Christians and Muslims on the West Bank,"" he added. Councillor Gordon Lishman said he believed there was an ""unspoken alliance between Hamas and [Israel's Prime Minister] Benjamin Netanyahu"" because both of them ""have an interest in maintaining conflict"". Labour member Gail Barton questioned the motion's wording asking the government to ""guarantee"" the prompt opening of aid corridors into Gaza. She said: ""As a British government we have no power to do that whatsoever. Words are important. "" Ms Khan responded: ""I don't think any of these people would forgive us for being pedantic about a word.  ""These are real people. Nobody will silence us on this. Every human life matters.

Mohammed Rangzeb, who represents Ravensthorpe on the city council, said he would now sit as an independent councillor. He has called for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas - something the Tories nationally have ruled out backing. The Conservatives national leadership has said they are steadfastly committed to Israel's right to defend itself. Mr Rangzeb said: ""I decided to leave the party on Friday and sent my resignation. I can't support the party's national stand on the Gaza conflict.  ""Too many innocent lives lost and yet the party won't call for a ceasefire. That's why I decided to leave the party.

"" The Conservative MP for Peterborough, Paul Bristow, was sacked from his junior government post in October after also calling for a permanent ceasefire. Responding to Mr Rangzeb's resignation, a spokesperson for the party said: ""The Conservative Party is steadfastly committed to supporting Israel and its right to defend itself, whilst recognising this must be in line with international law.  ""We have also called for humanitarian pauses to allow aid into Gaza.  ""Cllr Rangzeb has indicated he does not agree with this position and therefore resigned. We wish him well for the future.

Lord Cameron also warned ""too many civilians have been killed"" in Gaza.  More than 18,000 people have been killed, including thousands of children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. His intervention in a Sunday Times article marks a shift in tone from the UK government, but stops short of calling for an immediate ceasefire.  Penning a joint article with Germany's Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, Lord Cameron said he supported a ceasefire only if it was sustainable in the long term.  He said: ""Our goal cannot simply be an end to fighting today. It must be peace lasting for days, years, generations.  ""We therefore support a ceasefire, but only if it is sustainable. "" Earlier this week the UK and Germany abstained over a United Nations resolution, backed by 153 countries, demanding an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza. On Sunday France, which was among the countries which voted for the resolution, called for an ""immediate and durable truce"" in the conflict, ahead of a meeting between the French and Israeli foreign ministers in Tel Aviv.  Seeking to explain the UK's position, Lord Cameron wrote: ""We do not believe that calling right now for a general and immediate ceasefire, hoping it somehow becomes permanent, is the way forward. "" He added: ""Would Hamas stop firing rockets? Would it release the hostages? Would its murderous ideology change? An unsustainable ceasefire, quickly collapsing into further violence, would only make it harder to build the confidence needed for peace. "" Instead the UK and Germany are pushing for further humanitarian pauses to get more aid in and more hostages out.  Lord Cameron's comments amplify Rishi Sunak's line set out at Wednesday's Prime Minister's Questions.  ""We have been consistent that what we support is a sustainable ceasefire, which means Hamas must stop launching rockets into Israel and release all the hostages,"" Mr Sunak said.  Appearing on the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden said: ""In order for a ceasefire to be sustainable, we have to ensure we remove the threat of Hamas from Israel. . . ""So, that's why we continue to support Israel in its right to self-defence, to remove the threat of Hamas, and at the same time to get those hostages back. "" Asked if he thought Israel had gone too far, Mr Dowden said: ""I wouldn't characterise it as Israel going too far. Israel is dealing with a very difficult situation. "" He said the UK continued to urge Israel to exercise restraint but added: ""If you're going after an enemy that literally hides underneath hospitals, hides amongst the civilian population, you are going to sustain high levels of civilian casualties. "" The offensive into Gaza, triggered by Hamas's deadly 7 October attack on Israel which killed 1,200 people, has led to vast areas of the territory being flattened.  In a sign attitudes are shifting, in the article, the UK and German foreign ministers warned that Israel ""should do more to discriminate sufficiently between terrorists and civilians"".  They also said more aid must reach Gaza, amid warnings from the United Nations of a humanitarian catastrophe due to widespread shortages of basic supplies. Israel's main ally the US has also expressed unease over the failure of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's administration to reduce civilian casualties.  Deflecting that pressure on Saturday, Mr Netanyahu said: ""Military pressure is necessary both for the return of the hostages and for victory. Without military pressure. . . we have nothing.

1703,2023-12-17 12:17:31+00:00,/news/world-middle-east-67740979,"France has called for an ""immediate and durable truce"" in the Israel-Hamas war, saying that it is deeply concerned about the situation in Gaza.   Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna added that too many civilians were being killed.  Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen said a ceasefire would be an error, describing it as a gift to Hamas.  The UK and Germany earlier called for a ""sustainable ceasefire"", but stopped short of saying it should be immediate. Ms Colonna arrived in Tel Aviv on Sunday for a meeting with her Israeli counterpart Eli Cohen. A statement released by the French Foreign Ministry before her visit said she would call for a truce, which should ""lead to a lasting ceasefire with the aim of releasing all hostages and delivering aid to Gaza"".  During the meeting with Mr Cohen, the French foreign minister added that the victims of the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October should not be forgotten.  Mr Cohen repeated the Israeli government's position that there would be no ceasefire.  But he said that France could play an important role in preventing the escalation of regional tensions.  He added that while Israel ""has no intention to start another front"" on its northern border with Lebanon, it would do ""whatever it takes"" to protect Israeli citizens.   Israel has been engaged in regular cross-border exchanges of fire with armed groups in southern Lebanon, most notably with the Iran-backed Hezbollah.  Earlier on Sunday, UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron and German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock called for a ""sustainable ceasefire"" in the conflict.  In a joint article in the Sunday Times, Lord Cameron said he supported a ceasefire only if it was sustainable in the long term. Although this marks a shift in tone from the UK government, it does not go as far as calling for an immediate ceasefire. On Tuesday, the UK and Germany abstained over a United Nations resolution to this effect, backed by 153 countries. ""We do not believe that calling right now for a general and immediate ceasefire, hoping it somehow becomes permanent, is the way forward,"" Lord Cameron wrote seeking to explain the UK's decision.

Would it release the hostages. . . an unsustainable ceasefire, quickly collapsing into further violence, would only make it harder to build the confidence needed for peace. "" Instead the UK and Germany are pushing for further humanitarian pauses to get more aid in and more hostages out. Catherine Colonna is also scheduled to meet the families of French hostages still being held by Hamas during her visit to Israel. Referring to allegations of sexual assault during the 7 October attacks, Ms Colonna said France ""believed the words of the victims"" and those who witnessed the alleged attacks.  Earlier this week, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) recovered the body of 28-year-old French-Israeli hostage Elya Toledano.  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the Israeli government is still trying to complete the recovery of all the hostages held in Gaza, saying military pressure on Hamas was needed to secure their release.  Mr Netanyahu has indicated that talks are happening, and there are reports which suggest both Egypt and Qatar are involved in the discussions.  But Hamas has said there will be no negotiations to release hostages ""unless the aggression against our people stops once and for all"". On Friday, the IDF accidentally killed three Israeli hostages during its operations in Gaza.  Yotam Haim, 28, Samer Talalka, 22, and Alon Shamriz, 26 were shot at whilst holding a white cloth - the IDF said the incident was ""against our rules of engagement"" and that it was investigating the incident.  There are still more than 120 people still being held in Gaza, and the accidental killing has added pressure on Israeli authorities to reach a deal for their release.  France's Foreign Ministry has also demanded Israel explain an airstrike which killed one of its staff in Rafah this week.  The employee died of his injuries as a result of the strike in Rafah, which the foreign ministry said also killed other civilians. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 18,700 people have been killed and over 50,000 injured in the territory since the start of the war.

1704,2023-12-08 14:44:48+00:00,/news/world-middle-east-67646964,"As Israel presses its military offensive across Gaza, the army has been repeatedly advising some two million civilians to move to a ""humanitarian zone"" smaller than London's Heathrow Airport. Al-Mawasi is a narrow strip of land by the Mediterranean Sea. It has few buildings and largely consists of sandy dunes and agricultural land. The zone designated as safe by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), is just 8.5 sq km (3.3 sq miles). Reem Abd Rabu has spent the last few weeks sleeping on the ground and sharing a tent with four other families in the area. She is one of the 1.8 million Palestinians who have been displaced since the war began on 7 October after Hamas's attack on Israel. She first travelled to Khan Younis after fleeing northern Gaza, but after nearby houses were bombed, she said she felt she had to go to the place the Israeli army identified on the map as safe. Reem told the BBC al-Mawasi was an abandoned place, ""not a place for human beings"". She thought it would be safe from the intense bombardment and fighting, but when she arrived, she found little to no basic services. ""Water comes one day and not for the next 10 days, even in the bathrooms. And it's the same thing for electricity,"" she told the BBC. The IDF has urged civilians to move to al-Mawasi on at least 15 occasions on social media, the last on 2 December. The first mention of the humanitarian zone was on 18 October, when the IDF's Arabic spokesperson posted on X: ""The IDF orders Gaza residents to move to the humanitarian zone in the area of al-Mawasi, to which international humanitarian aid will be directed if necessary. "" Another post, from 21 October, stated: ""If your life and the lives of those you love are important to you, head south of Wadi Gaza. We advise you to arrive at the humanitarian area in Mawasi according to our instructions. "" Little to no internet connectivity has made it difficult for people to find safe areas in other parts of Gaza.  However, even the IDF instructions on al-Mawasi have changed several times. Civilians say the changing messaging has made it difficult for them to know exactly where to find safety there too. Each IDF post has been accompanied by a map pinpointing a small area within al-Mawasi that Gazans should evacuate to.  But different areas in al-Mawasi have been designated as ""humanitarian zones"" by Israel on different dates. On 18 October, the IDF designated the humanitarian zone marked in purple below. But three days later, the IDF declared a different area - shown in blue. Then, on 30 October, the area changed again - to the one marked in green.  Mona al-Astal, who has also fled to al-Mawasi, says she is kept awake all night by the sound of shelling. She is a doctor who says she was forced to leave Khan Younis after her neighbour's home was bombed. Mona also describes a lack of water, electricity and supplies in the humanitarian zone. She said she had been forced to buy a tent and other supplies for $300 (£238).  Mona said that she had seen people breaking into a UN agency storehouse because ""they were so hungry, they have nothing to eat"". To make matters worse, diseases including lice, chicken pox and intestinal infections have become widespread among children, she says. ""With every day that passes, the danger for us here increases,"" Mona added. Mohammed Ghanem fled from an area near al-Shifa hospital in northern Gaza where he said more than 25 strikes occurred next to his house. He said he came to al-Mawasi because ""the Israeli army has been directing people here"" but said the area was ""neither humane nor safe"". He described seeing Israeli tanks less than a kilometre away and said there had been strikes on an area just 500 metres (1,640ft) from the humanitarian zone. The BBC has identified at least one area of damage approximately 500m away from the designated area of al-Mawasi since the IDF began directing people there.  The BBC has contacted Israeli forces, but has not received a response.  The IDF does claim that on 6 December Hamas ""launched a rocket from a humanitarian zone toward Israel"", and released a map with al-Mawasi marked. The BBC has not been able to independently verify this. International agencies have been voicing concerns about the viability of humanitarian zones in Gaza when fighting and air strikes extend across so much of the territory. In mid-November the World Health Organization (WHO) said that the plan for al-Mawasi was ""a recipe for disaster"".  WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: ""Attempting to cram so many people into such a small area with such little infrastructure or services will significantly increase risks to health for people who are already on the brink. "" The United Nations also has wider concerns about the plan. ""The situation in Gaza is catastrophic; no one and no place is safe,"" Andrea de Domenico, the head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) told the BBC. ""Safe zones declared unilaterally cannot protect civilians"", he added.

Syed Muhammad Faisal Sami, head of the Birmingham-based Faizen Global Relief Foundation, called for more essential supplies to be sent. He said: ""They don't have any shelters, they don't have any food, they are running out of water and now the winter is starting as well. ""Many of Gaza's 2.3 million residents are sheltering in the south after being previously ordered to leave the north by Israel. Israel's military has been expanding its ground offensive against Hamas. It said it would operate with ""maximum force"" in the south, as it had done in the north - where there has been widespread destruction over the past eight weeks. Mr Sami was in the region for three days and said aid agencies were trying their best to help those who had been forced to leave their homes. He estimated his charity's containers, sent from Turkey, had fed about 41,000 people in Gaza so far. Israel launched a full-scale campaign in Gaza in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on 7 October, in which at least 1,200 people were killed and about 240 others taken hostage. Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says almost 15,900 people have been killed in the territory since the war began, while the UN says a humanitarian catastrophe is unfolding.

1706,2023-12-10 18:10:50+00:00,/news/world-middle-east-67676982,"Israel's bombardment of Gaza is ""narrowing the window"" for a new truce, the Qatari prime minister has said.  Speaking at the Doha Forum, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani said Qatar would continue its efforts to pressure both sides into a ceasefire.  The Gulf state played a key role negotiating the week-long pause in violence at the end of November, which allowed the release of hostages.  Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday ""the war is in full swing"". He said in recent days ""dozens of Hamas terrorists"" had surrendered, and were ""laying down their weapons and handing themselves over to our heroic fighters"". ""This is the beginning of the end for Hamas,"" he said. The comments come as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza continues to worsen. On Sunday afternoon, the Hamas-run health agency in Gaza said almost 18,000 Palestinians had now been killed.  In an audio message to Al Jazeera, Hamas's armed wing said the temporary ceasefire had ""proved its credibility"" and that no more hostages would be freed until Israel engaged in talks.  In the message, spokesman Abu Ubaida also said Hamas fighters had fully or partially destroyed 180 military vehicles and killed ""a large number"" of Israeli soldiers, and that it is still inflicting blows on Israel, and ""what is coming is greater"". At the conference in Doha, Philippe Lazzarini, the head of UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, said the area had become ""hell on earth"" and was ""definitely the worst situation I have ever seen"".  Also speaking at the conference, Palestinian PM Mohammad Shtayyeh said Israel ""should not be allowed to keep violating international humanitarian law"", and called for international sanctions.  Mr Shtayyeh represents the Palestinian Authority, the organisation which operates in the West Bank and which is separate to the Hamas government operating in Gaza.  As the meeting took place in Doha, in the south of Gaza fighting continued to rage.  The city of Khan Younis, the place people were told to head to to escape the fighting in the north, is now under heavy bombardments - with Israel asking civilians to leave its centre.  Speaking to BBC News, senior Israeli adviser Mark Regev said there was going to be ""difficult fighting"" in Khan Younis, and urged civilians to ""move to safe zones"" - with Israeli tanks reaching the centre of the city on Sunday evening.   Civilians in the city have been pictured collecting bodies and mourning family members killed in fighting. When asked about the situation in what Israel calls safe areas, Mr Regev said his country has made a maximum effort to try to safeguard civilian lives. Civilians in Gaza have formerly been advised to make their way to a ""safe zone"" at al-Mawasi. Measuring just 8.5 sq km (3.3 sq miles), the area is smaller than London's Heathrow Airport, has few buildings and largely consists of sandy dunes and agricultural land. Meanwhile, Israel has also been engaging in international diplomacy - calling out its allies for an inconsistent approach.  ""You cannot on the one hand support the elimination of Hamas and on other pressure us to end the war, which would prevent the elimination of Hamas,"" said Mr Netanyahu while briefing his cabinet. He was speaking two days after 13 members of the UN Security Council supported a resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire, with the US vetoing the move and the UK abstaining.  Israel also denied a claim by UNRWA chief Mr Lazzarini that it was trying to force Gazans out of the region and into Egypt - something previously reported in Israeli media.   The World Health Organization has also taken the unusual step of passing a resolution calling for immediate medical access to Gaza, with its director-general earlier calling the situation in the area ""catastrophic"".

1707,2023-12-14 15:02:29+00:00,/news/world-middle-east-67714515,"""The situation in the Gaza Strip and especially in Rafah is deadly. "" Dr Marwan al-Hams is the director of Rafah's Martyr Mohammed Yusuf al-Najjar Hospital, which has 63 beds but is currently caring for 145 patients. The hospital is operating at more than twice its capacity because Rafah, which lies on the border with Egypt, is now home to about one million displaced Palestinians, on top of the pre-war population of 300,000. ""The lack of medicine is catastrophic and there is no space in hospitals,"" Dr Hams told the BBC. After nine weeks of war between Israel and Hamas, only 11 out of Gaza's 36 hospitals are partially functional and able to admit new patients, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Only one of them is in the north. The hospitals have been overwhelmed by casualties, with the Hamas-run health ministry reporting that at least 18,600 people have been killed and 50,500 wounded.  Communicable diseases are also spreading in overcrowded shelters, schools and houses, and hospitals are receiving patients with severe diarrhoea, fatigue and a high temperature.  Such infections are spread through contaminated water and food, as well as close contact with other people.  The WHO says there is on average one shower per 700 people and one toilet per 150 people in Gaza. People trying to survive the Israeli bombardment. It is almost impossible for them to find soap or detergent, and everything else is secondary. ""The number of people coming to hospitals and health centres with chickenpox was around 4,593. . . five days ago,"" said Dr Hams.  Measles is also an issue, with five cases so far recorded.  Dr Hams said meningitis was another serious disease and that 115 cases had been recorded across the Gaza Strip. Skin diseases and rashes have also been spreading, with 35,300 cases at the territory's hospitals last Friday. ""We've also seen 17,511 cases of people coming to hospitals and clinics with parasites,"" he said. ""We can't find the medication for them. "" In addition, there have been 19,350 cases of scabies - an itchy rash caused by tiny mites that burrow into the skin - which is spread through close contact. Health authorities in Gaza have registered 350 cases of dysentery, an infection of the intestines which causes diarrhoea containing blood or mucus, as well as vomiting and painful stomach cramps. It is highly infectious. ""This is all in addition to food poisoning,"" said Dr Hams. ""Due to the shortage of food, people are resorting to eating old bread. They wash it, dry it in front of a fire or over a heater and then eat it. "" People are also presenting with jaundice, when your skin or the whites of your eyes turn yellow. It can be a sign of liver disease. More than 4,100 cases of hepatitis, a term used to describe inflammation of the liver, have been registered. There are five main types of hepatitis caused by specific viruses, with Hepatitis A usually caught by consuming food and drink contaminated with the faeces of an infected person. Dr Hams called for all wells to be opened so that displaced people could get clean water. ""Still water sources or swamps, which spread disease through mosquitoes and parasites, should be shut,"" he added.  He was also sure that all the medical supplies that had entered the Gaza Strip have been used up. ""We are also now at the start of the cold weather. If flu or respiratory diseases spread, we will not be able to cope as a health ministry, especially in Rafah city,"" he warned. ""We used to get 1,500 daily cases every day at the reception area only. Now, we are already getting over 2,000 people coming in. "" ""If it spreads more and becomes an epidemic, it will really be catastrophic. ""    Dr Hams ended with a plea for more fuel, which hospitals need for their generators. Fuel deliveries have been heavily restricted by the Israelis, who say Hamas could use it for military purposes. ""We are calling on officials to open the Rafah crossing to let fuel in, which is our life blood,"" he said. ""All hospitals from north to south should get access.

1708,2023-12-18 17:04:33+00:00,/news/world-middle-east-67749557,"At least 110 people have been killed in Israeli air strikes in northern Gaza's Jabalia area, the Hamas-run health ministry says, as fighting continues across the Palestinian territory. Fifty people were reportedly killed and dozens trapped under rubble when three homes in Jabalia refugee camp were hit. Videos showed the bodies of small children lined up at a medical centre. The Israeli military said it had been conducting operations against Hamas ""terrorist infrastructure"" in Jabalia. It came as the US defence secretary arrived in Tel Aviv for talks with Israeli leaders that were expected to focus on how to lower the intensity of the fighting to protect civilians. The UN Security Council was also expected to vote later on a resolution calling for an ""urgent and sustainable cessation of hostilities"", amid reports of discussions on a potential new deal to secure the release of more Israeli hostages held by Hamas. Gaza has been devastated by 10 weeks of war triggered by an unprecedented attack by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October, in which at least 1,200 people - mostly civilians - were killed and about 240 taken hostage.  Since then, more than 19,400 people have been killed in Gaza, about 70% of them women and children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Witnesses and local journalists said Israeli missiles struck a block of houses in Jabalia refugee camp where three families had been living on Sunday night. On Monday morning, Palestinian media cited the Hamas-run health ministry's director general as saying that at least 50 people had been killed when the homes of the al-Bursh and Alwan families were bombed. He added that it brought to 110 the death toll in the wider Jabalia area since Sunday. Local journalists also posted videos on social media showing what they said were the bodies of nine children on the floor of the Jabalia Medical Centre. One identified the children as members of the al-Bursh and Suleiman families.   Another 20 to 30 people were reportedly trapped beneath the rubble of the destroyed homes. BBC Gaza correspondent Rushdi Abu Alouf, who is currently in Istanbul, says verifying reports from the north is very difficult because of communication and access problems. But, he adds, Jabalia refugee camp has been a focus of Israeli ground operations over the past few weeks. And air strikes have intensified since Israeli tanks reportedly pulled out of the camp two days ago. When asked about the Jabalia strikes by AFP news agency, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stressed that it went to great lengths to avoid civilian casualties. ""When planning a target, the IDF devotes significant time and resources to preparing the attack and where feasible, uses various tools, including advance warnings, roof knocking, street knocking, target clearing operations and a variety of professional calculations,"" it said. The IDF separately announced that its troops had been conducting operations in Jabalia and that they had uncovered cash worth almost $1.4m (£1.1m) in suitcases alongside weapons in the home of a senior Hamas figure. Gaza's health ministry also said that a 13-year-old girl was killed when an Israeli tank shell hit the maternity building of Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis on Sunday night.  The girl, Dunia Abu Mohsen, had been receiving treatment after losing a leg in a previous strike in al-Amal that killed her parents, brother and sister. Another eight people, including journalist Haneen al-Qashtan, were reportedly killed in a strike in Nuseirat refugee camp, in central Gaza. US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin was expected to tell Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and war cabinet in their meetings on Monday that Israel had to move away from its major combat operations to a more limited conflict targeting Hamas while shielding civilians. At a news conference with Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, Mr Austin said protecting Palestinian civilians in Gaza was ""both a moral duty and a strategic imperative"". Asked about a transition to lower intensity warfare, he stressed: ""This is Israel's operation, and I'm not here to dictate timelines or terms. "" The UK, Germany and France added to the growing global pressure for a ceasefire over the weekend, saying that too many civilians had been killed. European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell echoed those comments on Monday, saying: ""We are witnessing an appalling lack of distinction in Israel's military operation in Gaza. "" In Israel, there are calls for any pause in the fighting to be linked to a new hostage release deal, after last week's mistaken killing by Israeli forces of three men who had been held captive in Gaza. In another development on Monday, Human Rights Watch accused Israel's military of ""using starvation of civilians as a method of warfare"". ""Israeli forces are deliberately blocking the delivery of water, food and fuel, while wilfully impeding humanitarian assistance, apparently razing agricultural areas, and depriving the civilian population of objects indispensable to their survival,"" it alleged. Israeli government spokesman Eylon Levy called the report ""a lie"". ""Israel has excess capacity to inspect more than twice as many aid trucks as are entering Gaza. We're still pumping water into Gaza through two pipelines and have placed no restrictions on entry of food and water.

The campaign group said it had also blockaded defence factories in Dorset, Brighton and Lancashire. It is urging BAE Systems to end ties with Israel and cease all weapons, defence and supplies trading. Protesters with Palestinian flags also said they wanted the UK Government to back a permanent ceasefire in Gaza. BAE Systems said it respects ""everyone's right to protest peacefully"". Workers for a Free Palestine said BAE Systems produces components of weapons sold to Israel - including the F35 combat aircraft and the Mk 38 Mod 2 machine gun. The activists blocked one entrance to the BAE site with a large banner stating ""Stop Arming Israel"". Police Scotland officers were in attendance at the demonstration. Protester Bint Sanna, who did not want to give her real name, told BBC Scotland News the group wanted to ""put a stop to UK government support for Israel"".  She added: ""They are supporting them to commit genocide to kill thousands of innocent children, thousands of innocent women and men and destroying homes. "" Another campaigner, Hex, said he travelled from Edinburgh to attend after a call to action from Palestinian trade unions.  He said: ""While we can shut down this door and we can prevent the factory from running for a day, it's really the guys in there that have the real power. "" Protester Oli said the group was not targeting yard workers with the action. He added: ""We're here to blame the managers who decide to produce and sell arms to Israel.

""We operate under the tightest regulation and comply fully with all applicable defence export controls, which are subject to ongoing assessment.

1713,2023-12-14 19:11:54+00:00,/news/world-us-canada-67717040,"Israel's war in Gaza may take ""more than several months"", the country's defence minister has told US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan.  Mr Sullivan arrived in Israel earlier on Thursday to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other top officials.  Earlier this week, Joe Biden said Israel's ""indiscriminate bombing"" of Gaza was costing it support globally.  The UN this week warned of a dire humanitarian situation in Gaza. During a meeting with Mr Sullivan on Thursday, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said that ""Hamas is a terrorist organisation that built itself over a decade to fight Israel"".  ""They built infrastructure under the ground and above the ground and it is not easy to destroy them,"" Mr Gallant said. ""It will require a period of time - it will last more than several months, but we will win and we will destroy them. "" While the US has repeatedly pledged its support to Israel and sent billions of dollars worth of military aid, alarm is growing over the mounting civilian death toll of the war.  President Biden is also facing increasing domestic calls - including some from within his own party - to do more to pressure Israel to exercise restraint during operations in Gaza.  In a brief speech on Thursday, Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said that US credibility is ""on the line"", as is the ""credibility of our commitment to human rights"" as a result of the Gaza conflict and a perception that Palestinian human rights are ""conditional"".  ""We cannot allow ourselves to set that precedent,"" she said. ""There is a human cost that is too high and we have reached it. That's why we must join together and call for a ceasefire now. ""  Mr Sullivan's visit to Israel comes just days after Mr Biden said that Israel was ""starting to lose"" international support because of the ""indiscriminate bombing that takes place"" in Gaza.  On the same day, Prime Minister Netanyahu said in a statement that Israel had ""the full backing"" of the US, which had blocked ""international pressure to stop the war"". Citing two unnamed US officials, CBS - the BBC's US partner - has reported that Israeli officials have told the US that the current phase of military operations would last two or three more weeks, but would be followed by a prolonged campaign of targeted strikes aimed at Hamas leadership targets.  The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has said more than 18,400 people have been killed by Israeli bombing since 7 October, when a Hamas attack into Israel left about 1,200 people dead.  At a news conference in Geneva on Thursday, the head of the UN's agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA)  said that conditions were becoming increasingly difficult, both for Palestinian civilians in Gaza and those who have successfully crossed into Egypt.  ""We meet more and more people who haven't eaten for one, two, or three days,"" he said.

1714,2023-12-01 19:07:37+00:00,/news/world-middle-east-67587999,"The resumption of fighting between Israel and Hamas has been met with a mixture of fear and anger in Gaza, with the UN calling it a ""nightmare"". A temporary ceasefire expired at 07:00 (05:00 GMT) with both warring sides blaming each other. Since then, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says 178 people have been killed in Israeli attacks. A UN official said much-needed aid had stopped coming through the Rafah crossing since the ceasefire ended. On Friday morning, the sound of heavy gunfire could be heard in areas of northern Gaza infiltrated by the Israeli military, with clashes breaking out between Israeli soldiers and Hamas fighters.  There seemed to be no let up in the pace of fighting after the ceasefire, with jet fighters and reconnaissance planes deployed.  Areas targeted by air strikes included north-western Gaza and Khan Younis in the south - where hundreds of thousands of people fled earlier in the war to escape fighting in the north. Houses in the city were targeted - including one house in close proximity to Nasser hospital, where the BBC Arabic team was based. ""Around 06:30 the drones started flying,"" Mohammad Ghalaiyini, a Briton who is currently in Khan Younis with his family, said in a voice message sent to the BBC. ""Around 07:30, I think, the bombings started and there's been like non-stop bombing every 10, 15, 20 minutes. "" Leaflets dropped by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) warned that areas east of Khan Younis and Salah al-Din were ""dangerous"" combat zones and urged people in some parts to head to shelters further south in Rafah, close to the Egyptian border. Meanwhile, Hamas and other groups fired rockets at Israel, which deployed its Iron Dome defence system to intercept them. The renewed clashes were ""catastrophic for the people of Gaza,"" James Elder, a spokesman for the UN children's agency, Unicef, told the BBC. Mr Elder said Nasser hospital - which he said was now Gaza's biggest functioning medical facility - was ""wildly overflowing with children and people with wounds of war recovering from the last attack"". He said many families had been sleeping on mattresses at the hospital for weeks. ""This hospital cannot possibly cope with a surge in wounds from the battlefield with more children with burns, with those horrendous shrapnel injuries,"" he said. Other UN aid agencies have described similar conditions at other hospitals.  The situation at al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City was ""like a horror movie"" even before the bombing started again, World Health Organization (WHO) senior emergency officer Rob Holden said. His team - who visited the site earlier in the week - reported patients with ""the most horrific injuries"" lying on floors ""running with blood"", while the bodies of those who had been killed were lined up in the car park outside. The WHO says only 18 of Gaza's 36 hospitals are ""minimally to partially functional"".  ""Gaza's health system has been crippled by the ongoing hostilities,"" Richard Peeperkorn, the WHO's representative in the Palestinian territories, said. ""We are extremely concerned about the resumption of violence. "" There is also major concern over the wider humanitarian situation in Gaza, which is likely to worsen as fighting resumes. As supplies of cooking gas, food and water are dangerously low, shops are empty and there is not enough aid to distribute to displaced people. Many are sleeping in tents and have told the BBC they are struggling to cope with the cold weather conditions. They are desperately urging for more aid including warm clothing to be delivered.  They also say very little water, food and medicine is reaching hospitals. Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the UN's relief agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, said he was beyond mere concern that ""no humanitarian aid has been allowed into Gaza today including fuel"". Hundreds of trucks carrying aid were able to enter Gaza during the seven-day ceasefire but they were still fewer in number than the roughly 500 trucks that entered Gaza every day before the war. On Friday Mark Regev, senior adviser to the Israeli prime minister, said Hamas could have ensured the pause in fighting was extended if they had freed more hostages. ""They have close to 20 women [eligible for release] in the framework of the existing agreement, yet they chose not to do so,"" Mr Regev told the BBC. Asked whether those women were civilians or Israeli soldiers, Mr Regev said some of the women were in their 20s and had finished their military service. For its part, Hamas says it did make several offers regarding further hostage releases - all of which were rejected by Israel. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said its military strikes on Friday had hit Hamas command centres, underground sites and groups of Hamas fighters. Officials in Gaza say more than 14,800 people including about 6,000 children have been killed since Israel began its military campaign against Hamas there, with thousands more believed to be dead under rubble. It follows Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October during which it killed about 1,200 people and kidnapped 240 others.

Fifi Saba, whose sister is trapped inside the Holy Family Church, said people were scared to move out of fear of being shot. A mother and her daughter were killed inside the church by sniper fire on Saturday, the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem said. Pope Francis condemned the attack. ""A mother, Mrs Nahida Khalil Anton, and her daughter, Samar Kamal Anton, were killed, and others were wounded by the shooters while they were going to the bathroom,"" he said on Sunday. ""Some say, 'This is terrorism. This is war. ' Yes, it is war. It is terrorism,"" he added. Ms Saba, a Catholic from Gaza who now lives in the US, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that she was worried about her sister, her brother-in-law and their two children aged 9 and 12, who were trapped there. She said she was receiving news about them through a family member, who was able to speak to her sister once a day.  ""They are locked in,"" she said. ""They can't really see the street very much, and most of the time they're cut off from the world. They don't have their phones, they don't have internet, they don't have the news. "" She said her sister often asked for news about what was happening outside, and was able to hear bombs overhead.  ""The fear they have been living is unreal,"" she said.  Ms Saba said she received a message in which her sister said the ""situation is really difficult"".  ""I found out later that day that when she said the situation is very difficult, she was witnessing the killing of the two people - the two women in the church,"" Ms Saba said.  Ms Saba added that the family had spent ""a couple of hours"" hiding on the ground in the church compound, because ""they believed the Israelis were shooting anything that moves"".  ""They were terrified to go to the bathroom, because the women were shot trying to get to the toilet,"" she said, adding that the water to the church had been cut off for a few days.  Food was also scarce, she said, with those trapped living off boiled spaghetti for three weeks.  ""And I think the past couple of days they have had no food,"" she said.  On Saturday, the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem said two Christian women - named as Nahida and her daughter Samar - were shot and killed while walking to a building in the church complex known as the Sister's Convent.  ""One was killed as she tried to carry the other to safety,"" a statement said. Seven more people were shot and wounded as they ""tried to protect others inside the church compound"" on Saturday. The patriarchate said no warning had been given and added: ""They were shot in cold blood inside the premises of the parish, where there are no belligerents. "" The patriarchate said that earlier on Saturday an Israeli tank fired on part of the church compound with 54 disabled people inside. It caused a fire that destroyed the building's generator, the only source of electricity, and some of the disabled people can no longer use their respirators, the statement said. In response to the church's letter, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), said it took ""claims regarding harm to sensitive sites with the utmost seriousness"". It said an incident with its troops took place near a church in the Shejaiya area, and that an ""initial review suggests that IDF troops"" were operating against a Hamas ""threat that they identified in the area of the church"". ""The IDF is conducting a thorough review of the incident,"" it said.  The BBC has contacted the IDF for further comment on the accusations of indiscriminate shooting.   It is unclear why the church is allegedly being targeted, but Ms Saba said she did not believe Hamas fighters were inside, and that her sister had not mentioned their presence.  ""We've seen in the past 72 days how hospitals are attacked, schools are attacked, libraries are attacked, markets are attacked, bakeries are attacked. ""I find it hard to believe if that's the narrative they're using,"" she said.  Layla Moran, a UK member of parliament, also told the BBC that members of her extended family, who are Christian Palestinians, were trapped in the church, having sought refuge after their home was bombed in the first week of the war. ""I'm now no longer sure they are going to survive until Christmas,"" she said, adding that they no longer had access to food or water.  The family members said soldiers had entered the church compound in the last 24 hours and had taken over a room in a building.  The family has sent a photo, seen by the BBC, of two bodies lying in a street outside the church building. Ms Moran's relatives say the bodies have been decaying for days.  Ms Moran said there had been no explanation as to why Israeli soldiers might target the church and no warnings or leaflets were sent to people sheltering there. ""It does feel like it's making a mockery of keeping civilians safe,"" she said.  Israel says it is carrying out military operations in Gaza to ""eradicate"" Hamas and rescue hostages taken by the group in its 7 October attacks. The Israeli military has repeatedly said it does not target civilians.  The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 18,700 people have been killed and 50,000 injured in the enclave since the start of the war.",Gazans trapped in church 'fear being shot',"Gazans trapped in church fear being shot, says relative","israel,israel-gaza_war,gaza",http://bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-67746432,articles/article_1715.txt,results/article_1715.txt.json

1718,2023-12-10 01:56:00+00:00,/news/world-middle-east-67670679,"A senior UN aid official has warned that half of Gaza's population is starving, as fighting there continues. Carl Skau, deputy director of the UN World Food Programme, said only a fraction of supplies needed have been able to enter the Strip - and nine out of 10 people cannot eat every day. Conditions in Gaza have made deliveries ""almost impossible"", Mr Skau said.  Israel says it must continue air strikes on Gaza to eliminate Hamas and bring Israeli hostages home. Israel Defence Forces spokesman Lt Col Richard Hecht told the BBC on Saturday that ""any death and pain to a civilian is painful, but we don't have an alternative"". ""We are doing everything we can to get as much as possible inside the Gaza Strip,"" he said. Herzi Halevi, chief of staff of the IDF, was filmed telling soldiers the army has to ""press harder"" because ""we're seeing terrorists surrendering. . . a sign their network is collapsing"". Meanwhile, the Biden administration has used an emergency law to bypass Congress and authorise the sale of some 14,000 rounds of tank ammunition worth more than $106m (£85m) to Israel. Movement in and out of Gaza has been heavily restricted since 7 October, when Hamas fighters broke through Israel's heavily-guarded perimeter fence - killing 1,200 people and taking 240 hostages.  In response, Israel closed its borders with Gaza and began launching air strikes on the territory, restricting aid deliveries which Gazans heavily relied on. The Hamas-run health ministry says Israel has killed more than 17,700 Gazans in its retaliatory campaign, including more than 7,000 children. Only the Rafah crossing bordering Egypt has been open, allowing limited quantities of aid to reach Gaza. This week Israel agreed to open the Kerem Shalom crossing from Israel into Gaza in the next few days - but only for the inspection of aid lorries. The trucks would then go to Rafah to cross into Gaza. Mr Skau said nothing had prepared him for the ""fear, the chaos, and the despair"" he and his WFP team encountered during their trip to Gaza this week.  They witnessed ""confusion at warehouses, distribution points with thousands of desperate hungry people, supermarkets with bare shelves, and overcrowded shelters with bursting bathrooms,"" he said.  International pressure and a temporary seven-day ceasefire last month had allowed some badly-needed aid to enter the Gaza Strip, but the WFP insists a second border crossing is now needed to meet demand. Nine out of 10 families in some areas are spending ""a full day and night without any food at all"", according to Mr Skau.  People in Khan Younis in the south of Gaza, a city now surrounded on two fronts by Israeli tanks, say the situation there is dire.  Dr Ahmed Moghrabi, head of the plastic surgery and burns unit in the city's only remaining health facility, Nasser hospital, fought back tears as he spoke to the BBC about the lack of food.  ""I have a daughter, three years old, always she ask me (for) some sweets, some apple, some fruits. I can't provide. I feel helpless,"" he said. ""There is not enough food, there is not enough food, only rice, only rice can you believe? We eat once, once a day, only. "" Khan Younis has been the focus of heavy air strikes in recent days and the boss of Nasser hospital there said his team had ""lost control"" over the numbers of dead and wounded arriving at the facility. Israel says Hamas leaders are hiding in Khan Younis, possibly in an underground network of tunnels, and that it is fighting house to house and ""shaft to shaft"" to destroy the group's military capabilities.  Speaking on Saturday, the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, accused the United States of being complicit in war crimes, after it vetoed a UN Security Council resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.   Out of 15 of the Security Council members, 13 countries voted in favour of the resolution calling for a ceasefire. The UK abstained from the vote and the US was the only country to vote against the resolution. Mr Abbas, the leader of the Palestinian Authority, said he held Washington responsible for ""the bloodshed of Palestinian children, women, and elderly in Gaza at the hands of [Israeli] occupation forces"".  The US ambassador to the UN, Robert Wood, defended the veto, and said the resolution was calling for an ""unsustainable ceasefire"" which ""would leave Hamas in place able to repeat what it did on October 7"". Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said on Saturday he appreciated the ""correct stance"" the US had taken at the security council.  A seven-day temporary ceasefire ended just over a week ago. Under the truce, 78 hostages were released by Hamas in exchange for 180 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.  There are still more than 100 hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza.  On Saturday, it was confirmed that Israeli hostage Sahar Baruch, 25, had been killed, his kibbutz and a hostages' group said in a statement. It comes after the armed wing of Hamas released a video on Friday which it said showed the bloody aftermath of a failed IDF operation to free an Israeli hostage.","Half of Gaza's population is starving, warns UN","Israel-Gaza war: Half of Gaza's population is starving, warns UN","israel,israel_and_the_palestinians,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-67670679,articles/article_1718.txt,results/article_1718.txt.json
1719,2023-12-08 22:08:08+00:00,/news/world-middle-east-67664854,"The armed wing of Hamas has released a video which it says shows the bloody aftermath of a failed Israeli operation to free an Israeli hostage. In the footage, a man says he has been held for 40 days, suggesting the video may have been recorded in mid-November. A lot of blood is seen on a tiled floor, as well as military equipment, which Hamas claims to have captured.  The video ends with gruesome images of a bloodied body that appears to be that of the same hostage seen earlier. We are withholding the man's name - he says this and his age in the video.  A script in Arabic says that Israeli soldiers ""failed to reach"" the hostage, leading to his death, and that the Israeli team ""quickly fled the place"".  It claims that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) used an ambulance to reach the place where the hostage was being held.  The BBC has not verified the video and has no confirmation of the claims made by Hamas in it. At a briefing on Friday evening, chief IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari confirmed that two Israeli soldiers were seriously wounded during operations in Gaza to free hostages.  He said ""terrorists who participated in the kidnapping and holding of hostages"" had been killed, but he said no hostages had been released. It is not clear if he was talking about the same incident described in the Hamas video or something else. The IDF launched its military operation in Gaza after a deadly Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October. Israel says 1,200 people were killed and 240 taken hostage in the Hamas attack. A number of hostages were later released during a short-lived ceasefire - but not those who Hamas claims to be linked to the Israeli military.

1720,2023-12-04 17:43:46+00:00,/news/world-middle-east-67613153,"Hamas had a premeditated plan to use sexual violence as a weapon of war, an Israeli women's rights campaigner and lawyer has said. Prof Ruth Halperin-Kaddari said she saw footage of women in several locations whose condition left her in ""no doubt"" that they had been raped. There has been anger over the delay of some UN bodies to acknowledge claims of Hamas's sexual atrocities on 7 October. Israel has been exploring evidence of sexual crimes during the attacks. Warning: This article contains graphic details which some readers may find upsetting Israeli police say they have so far gathered more than 1,500 testimonies from witnesses and medics. Hamas has denied the group carried out sexual violence during the 7 October attacks.  Pictures and live footage streamed by the militants pointed to the gruesome nature of the attacks at the Supernova festival. A range of violence from gang rape to the sexual mutilation of murdered victims are being investigated by police. ""I saw a number of first-hand, eyewitness accounts, for example of one survivor who hid in the bushes and saw a woman next to her being raped by several men,"" Prof Halperin-Kaddari told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. She said she also spoke to a paramedic who treated a woman who lost a life-threatening amount of blood after reporting being raped by four men. ""I saw footage and pictures from numerous locations of bodies whose condition were all exhibiting the same pattern of mutilation and leaving no doubt that rape was performed on these women before they were executed,"" she said. Prof Halperin-Kaddari added that the the concentration of cases, all in one day but in several locations left her in ""no doubt"" that there was a ""premeditation to use sexual violence as a weapon of war. "" Hamas said it ""rejected and strongly denounced"" the reports of abuses. In a post on the messaging app Telegram, it said that such claims were ""lies"" by Israel that sought to distort the ""humane"" way Hamas has treated Israeli hostages. Hamas took some 240 people hostage on 7 October - 110 were released last week as part of a truce with Israel. Israeli women's rights and legal activists had been calling on key international organisations to publicly acknowledge reports of gender-based violence, including sexual violence, in the wake of Hamas's attacks. On Monday, dozens of demonstrators gathered outside the UN headquarters in New York, protesting over what they said was its inaction over the rape, abduction and mistreatment of Israeli women. Prof Halperin-Kaddari, who spent 12 years as a member of a UN convention on discrimination against women, said she and others have been calling on UN bodies to acknowledge these ""crimes against humanity"". ""Regrettably, until a week ago, none of them said the explicit word 'sexual violence'. It took them more than seven weeks,"" she said. The UN has yet to respond to accusations of a delay, but Prof Halperin-Kaddari visited the UN in Geneva just a week ago to draw attention to the violence. UN Women issued a statement - eight weeks after the attacks - acknowledging accounts of gender-based atrocities. ""This took them too long, much too long,"" Prof Halperin-Kaddari added. Yael Sherer from the Lobby to Combat Sexual Violence advocacy group told Today that men were also victims of sexual violence on 7 October. She said evidence is being gathered from some survivors of the attacks, as well as eyewitnesses and first responders, who have been detailing the violence. ""Hamas terrorists made sure to disgrace these people and dishonour them in many ways,"" she said.  This included violence carried out on the victims' bodies after they had died, Ms Sherer added.  ""We also saw people who were bleeding. . . [and] people who were tied down to furniture with zip-ties, and were not clothed, of many ages. "" An ongoing UN commission of inquiry investigating alleged war crimes on both sides of the Israel-Hamas conflict will include a focus on sexual violence carried out during the attacks on 7 October. However, Israel has not so far co-operated with the commission, viewing it as biased.  Navi Pillay, who chairs the inquiry, said if Tel Aviv did not want to co-operate, her team could still take evidence from survivors and witnesses outside the country. ""All they [Israel] have to do is let us in,"" she told the BBC, adding that survivors of the attacks should be able to get a UN hearing. Ms Pillay also rejected claims that the UN delayed acknowledging that sexual violence had taken place during Hamas's attacks and said ""every effort"" was being made as part of her team's investigations. The Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October killed 1,200 people. Since then, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says more than 15,500 people have been killed in Israel's military campaign which it launched in response.",Hamas planned rape as weapon of war - Israeli lawyer,Hamas planned sexual violence as weapon of war - Israeli campaigner,"israel,israel-gaza_war,hamas",http://bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-67613153,articles/article_1720.txt,results/article_1720.txt.json
1721,2023-12-05 17:15:49+00:00,/news/world-middle-east-67629181,"The BBC has seen and heard evidence of rape, sexual violence and mutilation of women during the 7 October Hamas attacks. WARNING: CONTAINS EXTREMELY GRAPHIC DESCRIPTIONS OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE AND RAPE Several people involved in collecting and identifying the bodies of those killed in the attack told us they had seen multiple signs of sexual assault, including broken pelvises, bruises, cuts and tears, and that the victims ranged from children and teenagers to pensioners. Video testimony of an eyewitness at the Nova music festival, shown to journalists by Israeli police, detailed the gang rape, mutilation and execution of one victim. Videos of naked and bloodied women filmed by Hamas on the day of the attack, and photographs of bodies taken at the sites afterwards, suggest that women were sexually targeted by their attackers. Few victims are thought to have survived to tell their own stories.   Their last moments are being pieced together from survivors, body-collectors, morgue staff and footage from the attack sites. Police have privately shown journalists a single horrific testimony that they filmed of a woman who was at the Nova festival site during the attack. She describes seeing Hamas fighters gang rape a woman and mutilate her, before the last of her attackers shot her in the head as he continued to rape her. In the video, the woman known as Witness S mimes the attackers picking up and passing the victim from one to another. ""She was alive,"" the witness says. ""She was bleeding from her back. ""  She goes on to detail how the men cut off parts of the victim's body during the assault. ""They sliced her breast and threw it on the street,"" she says. ""They were playing with it. "" The victim was passed to another man in uniform, she continues. ""He penetrated her, and shot her in the head before he finished. He didn't even pick up his pants; he shoots and ejaculates. "" One man we spoke to from the festival site said he heard the ""noises and screams of people being murdered, raped, decapitated"". To our question about how he could be sure - without seeing it - that the screams he heard indicated sexual assault rather than other kinds of violence, he said he believed while listening at the time that it could only have been rape.  A statement he made through a support organisation describes it as ""inhuman"".  ""Some women were raped before they were dead, some raped while injured, and some were already dead when the terrorists raped their lifeless bodies,"" his statement says. ""I desperately wanted to help, but there was nothing I could do. "" Police say they have ""multiple"" eye-witness accounts of sexual assault, but wouldn't give any more clarification on how many.  When we spoke to them, they hadn't yet interviewed any surviving victims. Hamas has rejected Israel's accusation that its men sexually assaulted women during the attacks. Israel's Women's Empowerment Minister, May Golan, told the BBC that a few victims of rape or sexual assault had survived the attacks, and that they were all currently receiving psychiatric treatment. ""But very, very few. The majority were brutally murdered,"" she said. ""They aren't able to talk - not with me, and not to anyone from the government [or] from the media. "" Videos filmed by Hamas include footage of one woman, handcuffed and taken hostage with cuts to her arms and a large patch of blood staining the seat of her trousers. In others, women carried away by the fighters appear to be naked or semi-clothed. Multiple photographs from the sites after the attack show the bodies of women naked from the waist down, or with their underwear ripped to one side, legs splayed, with signs of trauma to their genitals and legs.   ""It really feels like Hamas learned how to weaponise women's bodies from ISIS [the Islamic State group] in Iraq, from cases in Bosnia,"" said Dr Cochav Elkayam-Levy, a legal expert at the Davis Institute of International Relations at Hebrew University. ""It brings me chills just to know the details that they knew about what to do to women: cut their organs, mutilate their genitals, rape. It's horrifying to know this. "" ""I spoke with at least three girls who are now hospitalised for a very hard psychiatric situation because of the rapes they watched,"" Minister May Golan told me. ""They pretended to be dead and they watched it, and heard everything.  And they can't deal with it. "" Israel's police chief Yaacov Shabtai said that many survivors of the attacks were finding it difficult to talk and that he thought some of them would never testify about what they saw or experienced.  ""Eighteen young men and women have been hospitalised in mental health hospitals because they could no longer function,"" he said. Others are reportedly suicidal. One of those working with the teams around survivors told the BBC that some had already killed themselves. Much of the evidence has come from the volunteer body-collectors deployed after the attacks, and those who handled the bodies once they arrived at the Shura army base for identification. One of the body-collectors volunteering with the religious organisation Zaka described to me signs of torture and mutilation which included, he said, a pregnant woman whose womb had been ripped open before she was killed, and her foetus stabbed while it was inside her. The BBC has not been able to independently verify this account, and Israeli media reports have questioned some testimony from volunteers working in the traumatic aftermath of the Hamas attacks. Another, Nachman Dyksztejna, provided written testimony of seeing the bodies of two women in kibbutz Be'eri with their hands and legs tied to a bed.  ""One was sexually terrorised with a knife stuck in her vagina and all her internal organs removed,"" his statement says.    At the festival site, he says small shelters were ""filled with piles of women. Their clothing was torn on the upper part, but their bottoms were completely naked. Piles and piles of women. […] When you took a closer look at their heads, you saw a single shot straight to the brain of each. "" Hundreds of bodies were collected from the attack sites by volunteers.   Investigators admit that in those first chaotic days after the attacks, with some areas still active combat zones, opportunities to carefully document the crime scenes, or take forensic evidence, were limited or missed. ""For the first five days, we still had terrorists on the ground in Israel,"" May Golan said. ""And there were hundreds, hundreds of bodies everywhere. They were burned, they were without organs, they were butchered completely. "" ""This was a mass casualty event,"" police spokesman Dean Elsdunne told journalists at a briefing.   ""The first thing was to work on identifying the victims, not necessarily on crime scene investigation. People were waiting to hear what happened to their loved ones. "" It was staff at the army's Shura base, where bodies arrived for identification, who have provided investigators with some of the most crucial evidence. This evidence emerged from a makeshift hub of tents and refrigerated shipping containers set up at the base to identify the bodies. When we visited, hospital trolleys, their iron skeletons topped with khaki stretchers, stood neatly lined up in front of the containers that housed the dead; the white plastic overalls of those on shift translucent under the floodlights. Fighter jets roared overhead, drowning out the cicadas, as Israel's bombardment of Gaza continued. Teams here told us they'd seen clear evidence of rape and sexual violence on the bodies coming in, including broken pelvises from sustained violent abuse. ""We see women of all ages,"" one of the reservists on the forensic team, Captain Maayan, told the BBC. ""We see rape victims. We see women who have been through violation. We have pathologists and we see the bruises, we learn about the cuts and tears, and we know they have been sexually abused. "" I ask her what proportion of the bodies she's handled show signs of this. ""Abundant,"" she said. ""Abundant amount of women and girls of all ages. "" The number of victims is hard to define, partly because of the state of the bodies. ""It's definitely multiple,"" said another serving soldier who asked us to use only her first name, Avigayil. ""It's hard to tell. I've dealt with more than a few burned bodies and I have no idea what they went through beforehand. And bodies that are missing the bottom half - I also don't know if they were raped. But women that were clearly raped? There are enough. More than enough. ""  ""Sometimes we are left only with a very small part of the body,"" Dr Elkayam-Levy tells me. ""Maybe it's a finger, a foot or a hand that they're trying to identify. People were burned to ashes. Nothing was left. […] I want to say that we'll never know how many cases there were. "" Privately some of those working on this talk in terms of ""dozens"" of victims but quickly caution that evidence is still being gathered and pieced together. The civil commission headed by Dr Elkayam-Levy, to collect testimony on sexual crimes, is calling for international recognition that what happened on 7 October was systematic abuse, constituting Crimes Against Humanity. ""We see definite patterns,"" she told me. ""So it wasn't incidental, it wasn't random. They came with a clear order. It was […] rape as genocide. "" Avigayil agrees there were similarities in the violence visited on the bodies that arrived at the Shura base. ""There are patterns in that groups of women from the same place were treated in a similar manner,"" she said.   ""There might be a set of women who were raped in one way, and we're seeing similarities in the bodies; and then a different set that were not raped but shot multiple times in the exact same pattern. So it seems that different groups of terrorists had different forms of cruelty. "" ""This was a premeditative, systematic event,"" police chief Yaacov Shabtai told journalists. David Katz from Israel's cyber crime unit which is involved in the investigation, told journalists that it was too early to prove that sexual violence was planned as part of the attack, but that data extracted from the phones of the Hamas attackers suggested that ""everything was systematic"". ""It would be reckless to say we can already prove it […] but everything that was done there was done systematically,"" he said. ""Nothing happened by coincidence. Rape was systematic. "" Israel's government points to documents it says were found on Hamas fighters that appear to support the idea that sexual violence was planned. It's released clips of interrogations with some captured fighters in which they appear to say that women were targeted for this purpose. Last week, UN Women put out a statement saying it ""unequivocally condemn[ed] the brutal attacks by Hamas"" and was ""alarmed by the numerous accounts of gender-based atrocities and sexual violence during those attacks"". Dr Elkayam-Levy said before the statement that international women's rights organisations had taken far too long to respond to her call for support. ""This is the most documented atrocity humanity has known,"" she told me. ""Israel on 7 October is not the same country that woke up the following morning,"" said police chief Yaacov Shabtai. Amid the horror of what happened to women here, Captain Maayan from the Shura identification unit says the hardest moments are when she sees ""the mascara on their eyelashes, or the earrings they put on that morning"". I ask where that lands in her, as a woman. ""Terror,"" she replied. ""It terrorises us.

The video shows Chaim Peri, 79, Yoram Metzger, 80, and Amiram Cooper, 85. Mr Peri can be seen addressing the camera and calling for their release. About 120 hostages are believed to still be in captivity in Gaza after a deadly Hamas attack on 7 October. Israel's military described the footage as a ""criminal terror video"". ""It testifies to Hamas' cruelty towards innocent, very elderly civilians who are in need of medical care,"" said Daniel Hagari, a spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).  ""The world must act in order to deliver medical aid and check on the state of the hostages. We are morally obliged to make every and all efforts in order to bring the hostages back home,"" the spokesman added. The footage was released on the Telegram messaging app. The hostages taken in October are believed to be held by Hamas and allied Palestinian groups. Prisoners of war and hostages are protected under international humanitarian law and so the BBC does not broadcast the full details of material which may have been filmed under duress. A spokesperson for Kibbutz Nir Oz, where the men were abducted from, urged US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, who is currently visiting Israel, to secure their release. ""We appreciate any sign of life from the hostages, but time is running out,"" the spokesperson said. ""The immediate release of all those abducted, through any potential negotiation avenue, is urgently required. ""Each passing day exacerbates their situation. Recent events sadly illustrate that the hostages' situation is deteriorating with each passing day, particularly for older individuals. "" An estimated 240 hostages were taken to Gaza during Hamas's 7 October attacks that killed about 1,200 in southern Israel. Israel has launched a massive retaliatory operation it says is aimed at destroying Hamas. More than 18,000 people have been killed in Gaza since, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, with hundreds of thousands displaced. During a six-day ceasefire at the end of November, 105 hostages were released in exchange for Palestinians held in Israeli jails.  On Friday, three Israeli hostages mistakenly killed by Israeli soldiers in Gaza were shot dead while holding a white cloth, an Israeli military official said. The hostages - Yotam Haim, 28, Samer Talalka, 22, and Alon Shamriz, 26 - were killed in the Shejaiya neighbourhood of Gaza City. According to an Israeli military official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, the men emerged shirtless from a building, with one carrying a stick with a white cloth. One of the soldiers, the official added, felt threatened, as the men were at a distance of tens of metres, declared them ""terrorists"" and opened fire. Two were immediately killed while the third, wounded, returned to the building. A cry for help was heard in Hebrew and the battalion commander ordered the troops to cease fire. The wounded hostage later re-emerged, and was shot and killed, the official said. It is not clear if the hostages had been abandoned by their captors or escaped. An IDF official said the case was ""against our rules of engagement"" and an investigation was happening at the ""highest level"". Families of the remaining hostages have urged the Israeli government to reach a new truce for at least some of the captives to be freed.  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has deflected the calls, insisting ""military pressure is necessary both for the return of the hostages and for victory"". Speaking to reporters on Monday, US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby addressed rumours of a possible new hostage deal, and said talks were not at a point where an agreement was imminent.",Hamas shows video of three elderly Israeli hostages,Israel Gaza: Hamas releases video showing three elderly Israeli hostages,"israel,israel-gaza_war,hamas,gaza",http://bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-67752611,articles/article_1722.txt,results/article_1722.txt.json
1723,2023-12-13 16:07:47+00:00,/news/world-middle-east-67695861,"Since the war in Gaza began, Israel's military operations in the occupied West Bank have become more frequent, and more forceful. The northern city of Jenin - the epicentre of these raids before the Hamas attacks - is now a weekly battleground. The Palestinian teenagers I met who were running from the army there on Tuesday had the sceptical dismissive attitudes of much older men - mocking the Palestinian president and his appeals to the world for protection against Israel's occupation. Behind them, Israel's armoured bulldozers and military jeeps moved around the entrance to Jenin refugee camp, explosions and gunfire from across the city echoing along the deserted, shuttered streets.   The walls of this city are covered with the pictures of young men killed by Israeli forces - some of them members of armed groups like Hamas, proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the UK and others. The posters and the faces are refreshed, year after year.  Six men were killed in the operation here on Tuesday; four of them in a drone strike, witnesses said.   Israel says its operations in the West Bank are targeting members of armed groups, often those with Israeli blood on their hands. But the director of Jenin's hospital, Wissam Bakr, said a chronically ill 13-year-old child also died after being blocked from reaching medical care. ""The persistence of the incursions into Jenin, and the killing of young people - this will make the people more and more angry, because every day we lose one of our friends,"" he said.  ""This will not bring peace for Israel - this will bring more and more resistance. "" On 7 October, Hamas gunmen from Gaza attacked southern Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking 240 others hostage. More than 18,400 people are said to have been killed in Gaza during the war that followed. Here in the West Bank, 271 Palestinians, including 69 children, have been killed since the attacks - more than half the total number for the year. Almost all of them have been killed by Israeli forces, according to the United Nations. Since the Hamas attacks, support for armed resistance has risen in many parts of the West Bank - in places like Nablus and Jenin. ""I see it in the voices of people, in the music they play in their cars, from Facebook or social media posts, from my debates with my students,"" said Raed Debiy, a political scientist and youth leader for the West Bank's ruling party, Fatah, which dominates the Palestinian Authority (PA). He told me the attacks were ""a turning point"" for Palestinians, just as they were a shocking turning point for Israelis.  ""The people, especially the new generation, are backing Hamas now, more than at any other moment,"" he told me. ""In the previous 30 years, there were no models, no idols for the new generation; now they see there is something different, a different story is being created. ""  Even his 11-year-old nephew, he said, had little respect for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, but idolises Hamas military spokesman Abu Obeida - ""because he protects us"". ""Palestinian youth had priorities and wish lists about owning a house, or getting a degree,"" explained West Bank political scientist Amjad Bushkar.   ""But after 7 October, I think these priorities have totally changed. There are rising voices for full liberation of the homeland through resistance - whether that resistance is peaceful or armed. "" Dr Bushkar told me that he had spent a total of nine years in Israeli jails, and had been a member of Hamas's student wing in the past. Seven members of his family had been arrested since the 7 October attacks, he added. Hamas members in the West Bank have regularly been targeted by Palestinian security forces - not just Israeli ones - since the group took control of Gaza by force in 2007, a year after it won parliamentary elections.  But now, Dr Bushkar said, something had changed. ""Both Fatah and Hamas are well aware that they are complementary to each other, and I think we'll see real integration between the two movements. "" ""The Palestinian Authority realised that targeting Hamas would not eradicate it because it's an ideological movement rooted within the Palestinian people; and Hamas is fully aware that it cannot establish an independent [Palestinian] state without the help of Fatah. "" Some senior figures in the Palestinian administration - though not President Abbas - are now openly talking about the benefits of a united political front.  Earlier this month, Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh said in an interview with Bloomberg that the Palestinian Authority's preferred outcome of the war in Gaza would be for Hamas to join a unity government led by the PA. Qossay Hamed, an expert in Hamas at Al-Quds Open University in Ramallah, says the crisis in Gaza could end up strengthening the movement's political wing, at the expense of its military one. ""In any revolutionary movement, there should be a political harvest to [military] actions,"" he said.   ""There are so many trends within Hamas. And there are internal clashes. I think there will be more room for the political trend within Hamas, especially after this war, when the whole world will not be tolerant towards them. "" Israel says its goal in Gaza is to destroy Hamas, and has ruled out a role for either it or Fatah in Gaza's future government. ""I will not allow the entry into Gaza of those who teach terrorism, support terrorism and finance terrorism,"" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday.  ""Gaza will be neither Hamas-stan nor Fatah-stan. "" Some Palestinians privately say the price paid by Gaza for the Hamas attacks is too high. But others say the group's brutal tactics worked in forcing Israel to release Palestinian prisoners - and contrast its impact sharply with that of the Palestinian Authority, set up 30 years ago after the Oslo Accords to work with Israel on a future Palestinian State. An opinion poll carried out between 22 November and 2 December by a respected Palestinian think-tank, the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research (PSR), found that support for Hamas had more than tripled in the West Bank compared to three months ago.  Supporters of Hamas were still in a minority, but 70% of the respondents said armed struggle was the best means of ending the Israeli occupation.   By contrast, support for President Abbas had dropped sharply following the Hamas attacks, the survey found, with more than 90% of Palestinians in the West Bank calling for his resignation. Since the Hamas attacks, said Amjad Bushkar, ""the world and the international community have put the Palestinian cause on its list of priorities. "" Widely seen as corrupt and ineffective, the PA has also been unable to pay its civil servants or police since the Hamas attacks, because the war in Gaza caused a rift over the tax revenues transferred by Israel each month. While Hamas flags and slogans multiplied here in the wake of each busload of Palestinian prisoners released by Israel in exchange for Israeli hostages held in Gaza, the PA's president and security forces were conspicuously absent.  Israel may be determined to deny Hamas power in Gaza, but here in the West Bank its influence is already spreading.",Hamas support grows among Palestinians in West Bank,Support for Hamas grows among Palestinians in West Bank,"israel,israel_and_the_palestinians,israel-gaza_war,hamas",http://bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-67695861,articles/article_1723.txt,results/article_1723.txt.json
1724,2023-12-16 00:21:05+00:00,/news/world-middle-east-67708116,"There was speculation over whether another uprising was brewing in the West Bank, even before the Hamas attacks on Israel in October. Frequent raids by the Israeli army, emboldened by a hard-right Israeli government - following deadly attacks by Palestinians, and violent attacks on Palestinians by settlers - had already increased pressure on Palestinians there. Since the war in Gaza, those pressures have spiralled: Israeli raids into West Bank towns have become more frequent and more forceful, and many families are suffering economically after Israel withheld tax revenues used to pay public servants in the West Bank, and banned Palestinian workers from entering Israel too. There is anger at almost 20,000 Palestinians killed in Gaza, and support for Hamas is rising. But despite all this, calls by the armed group for an uprising in the West Bank over the past couple of months have come and gone. Support for Hamas - and armed resistance more generally - has risen sharply since the war in Gaza began.   An opinion poll by the Centre for Policy and Survey Research in Ramallah found that support for Hamas in the West Bank had more than tripled. Meanwhile, support for the West Bank's ruling party, Fatah, had dropped significantly. More than 90% of respondents thought Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas should resign. But it seems that support for armed resistance, and disillusion with politics, is not translating into action on the ground. Since the war began, weekly demonstrations have been held in West Bank cities. The slogans chanted there are against Israel - but also against the Palestinian Authority. But they're usually held in city centres where there is much less risk of confrontation with Israeli soldiers, rather than at checkpoints - as happened during the last Palestinian uprising in the early 2000s. And the numbers turning out for these weekly demonstrations are smaller than they were during previous moments of tension.   ""People hesitate to come when Hamas calls for demonstrations, because there is a clear security price to be paid from the Israeli response,"" said Raed Debiy, a political scientist and youth leader in Fatah. But they also don't come when Fatah calls for them, Debiy says, because ""people have lost hope in political parties"". As the actions of Israel's army in the West Bank have become harsher, and the Palestinian security services more efficient, many people fear that becoming an active member of a militant group could make them a target for arrest or assassination. More than 270 people have been killed by Israeli forces in the West Bank since Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October - including 70 children - according to the UN.  That's more than half the total number killed this year. Four Israelis - including three from the armed forces - have been killed by Palestinians there in the same period. An operation to arrest Palestinian gunmen in the Jenin refugee camp this week lasted several days, with frequent bursts of heavy gunfire, rocket attacks and air strikes. Hundreds of people were detained, with 60 of them handed over to the security services for further questioning. The Israeli army has also been trying to destroy infrastructure used by armed groups. This time, it claimed to have found more than a dozen underground tunnel shafts in the camp, as well as facilities for making explosives and ""observation control rooms"" to monitor Israeli forces. One young man from the camp, who was among those detained this week and released after questioning, said the reason people ignored calls by Hamas to rise up in solidarity was that the group did not supply the West Bank with enough equipment to fight the Israeli army. ""Hamas in the West Bank has not done a good job of organising itself over the last decade,"" said Khalil Shikaki, head of the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research in Ramallah.   ""The Israelis have been arresting a lot of their members. Hamas is just incapable right now in the West Bank of mobilising and organising an eruption of violence that would be sustainable. "" But previous uprisings here did not rely on Hamas. The second intifada (uprising), which began in 2000, was led by members of the West Bank's ruling party, Fatah.  The current leader of Fatah, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, is widely seen as trying to avoid an escalation in violence against Israel - a major shift in position from his predecessor, Yasser Arafat. His security services co-operate with Israel to arrest members of armed groups - something that is widely criticised by Palestinians. Sabri Saidam, a member of Fatah's Central Committee, denies that the party's position is at odds with public feeling in the territory, or that the Palestinian Authority (PA) is somehow avoiding a fight. ""To say that Fatah is in control and keeping the calm, [it's] as if you are hinting that there is a forceful implementation of a state of calm,"" he said. ""Nobody is forcing anything on anyone. "" ""People in the West Bank know that Netanyahu is throwing down bait, through persistent attacks every night against the people of Palestine regardless of their political affiliation - because he wants to provoke the Palestinians into a confrontational mood that he will use as an excuse to escalate the situation. "" The US is pushing Israel to allow a ""revitalised"" PA to govern Gaza once the war there ends. Israel has so far said it will not consider it.   But the chance to govern a unified Palestinian bloc for the first time since 2006 is another incentive for the Fatah-dominated PA to prove its credentials and stop the situation in the West Bank from spiralling out of control.  ""It's very clear that Fatah don't want any intifada,"" explained Raed Debiy, the party youth leader. ""They are still very keen to keep the status quo. But the grassroots of Fatah will not be controlled forever. How can you stay silent under daily assassination, daily invasion, daily violation of settlers - this will definitely lead to explosion. "" In 2000, the spark for the second intifada was a visit by then-Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon to a contested holy site in Jerusalem, known to Muslims as the al-Aqsa compound and to Jews at the Temple Mount. Sharon's visit happened amid smouldering Palestinian frustration at the failure of the Oslo peace process - and, Dr Shikaki says, was ""exploited"" by Fatah's young guard to launch the uprising. A small event like this could still trigger something significant, but the situation has shifted since 2000.   Now, far-right ministers in the Israeli government visit the compound, and make inflammatory claims about Israeli control of the site, without triggering a major response - at least not in the West Bank. ""We told the American administration many times that the pressure would definitely lead to some sort of reaction,"" said the senior Fatah leader, Sabri Saidam.  ""But no-one anticipated that the reaction would come from Gaza. "" Where the West Bank goes from here depends partly on what follows the war in Gaza.  That transition is likely to be a precarious time for the West Bank, with hopes of a unified Palestinian leadership - possibly opening the door to talks on a future Palestinian state - clashing with the opposition of Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. And lifting restrictions imposed by Israel after the attacks - separating Palestinian and settler vehicles on some roads, for example - could prompt a spike in friction. But a sustained uprising, of the kind seen two decades ago, will likely require a change in the policy of the West Bank's main political movement - and possibly even a change in its leader. ""It seems Fatah remains critical for an uprising to happen,"" Dr Shikaki told me. ""And as long as Fatah and the security services are not directly involved in the preparation for such an intifada, it seems highly unlikely we'll see one emerging. ""I don't yet see Fatah or the security services on the verge of a turning point,"" he continued. ""But we're moving in that direction. "" Others point to the dwindling faith in Palestinian politics to provide peace, a state, or just a better life. ""If we had anything on the political agenda, things could go quiet,"" Raed Debiy told me. ""But I'm not sure with this right-wing [Israeli] government whether there is anything solid on the table - so the only scenario I see is explosion.  It's just a matter of time.

1725,2023-12-07 19:42:19+00:00,/news/uk-england-london-67636667,"The story of Hanukkah will be ""more pertinent than ever before"" this year, the president of the Union of Jewish Students has said. Edward Isaacs said the union was asking students to light an extra candelabra used on the festival for Jewish people still being held in captivity by Hamas. Hanukkah, or the Festival of Lights, runs from 7 to 15 December this year. Events will be held in London, including in Golders Green and Trafalgar Square, to mark the festival. Mr Isaacs said: ""We have facilitated a hostage campaign, themed around Hanukkah, with every other youth movement within the British Jewish community. ""We are quite literally distributing thousands of Hanukkah candles, all of which come with a picture of a hostage on them, with the slogan, 'We light for those who can't', and hashtag 'Bring them home now'. Hanukkah or Chanukah is the Jewish Festival of Lights. It dates back to two centuries before the beginning of Christianity. The festival begins on the 25th day of Kislev, a month which occurs in November and December on the Gregorian calendar, and is celebrated for eight days.  In the western calendar Hanukkah is celebrated in November or December. The word Hanukkah means rededication and commemorates the Jews' struggle for religious freedom. ""While it is normally a joyous time, I think the focus on Jewish pride and resistance will still be there,"" said the 21-year-old, who is based in London. He added that Jewish students across the country were dealing with an ""unprecedented rise of antisemitism on campus"" and urged people to recognise it and call it out. Gary Mond, chairman of the National Jewish Assembly, said it was ""hard to say"" how many people would attend public events as the Gaza war continues. Mr Mond said the ""traditions of Hanukkah will continue to be observed"" but ""many Jews in this country are very fearful at the moment"". ""A lot of Jews feel very much alone in that they don't believe that they have had a lot of support from non-Jews and that they are facing higher levels of antisemitism than ever before,"" the 64-year-old said. ""I know that some of the chabads are organising celebrations and public menorah lightings,"" he said. ""It will be interesting to see how well attended they are. "" Reflecting on his own plans, he said: ""I think we'll probably go to the Golders Green chabad at least once during Hanukkah, maybe twice. ""The National Jewish Assembly is organising a Hanukkah party in the House of Lords and around 150 of our members and guests are coming. "" In Trafalgar Square, a giant menorah will be on display for a week from Thursday, with one of the lights lit at 16:00 GMT each day apart from on Saturday, when the lighting will be at 17:15. Speaking at the event, Rabbi Yossi Simon from Chabad Golders Green said: ""Hanukkah is all about light overpowering the darkness. . . one little candle can dispel a lot of darkness. "" He said lighting more candles each day reminds Jews to focus on ""increasing positive energy"", for example by ""uplifting someone"" or giving a smile. He added with current world events, this year ""there is an incredible effort"" going into Hanukkah celebrations including ""giant menorahs going up throughout the United Kingdom and across the world"" because ""people around the world are getting depressed, are feeling low, and we can uplift people"".

1726,2023-12-08 20:35:27+00:00,/news/world-us-canada-67662871,"Harvard's president has apologised for controversial remarks she made at a congressional hearing about antisemitism on US college campuses. When asked whether calls for the genocide of Jews constituted harassment under university policy, Dr Claudine Gay said it depended on the context. Dr Gay, and two other university presidents who gave similar answers, have since faced fierce criticism. ""I am sorry,"" she said in an interview with The Crimson student newspaper. ""Words matter. When words amplify distress and pain, I don't know how you could feel anything but regret,"" she added. Addressing the criticism in her interview with The Crimson, Dr Gay said she had ""got caught up in what had become at that point, an extended, combative exchange about policies and procedures"". It is the second time Harvard's first black president has sought to clarify comments that have drawn national condemnation, including from the White House. Some have since called for her resignation. The Ivy League school is one of several in the US accused of failing to protect its Jewish students following the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war two months ago. Jewish groups have reported an alarming rise in antisemitic incidents in the US since the conflict began.  At Tuesday's hearing before the Republican-led House Education and Workforce Committee, Dr Gay - along with the presidents of the University of Pennsylvania and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) - was challenged on university policies and procedures to combat antisemitism. Near the end of the nearly six-hour hearing, New York Republican Elise Stefanik asked the three women: ""Does calling for the genocide of Jews violate [your university's] code of conduct or rules regarding bullying and harassment? Yes or no?"" Each witness evaded a direct answer, saying ""it depends on the context"".  Dr Gay further added that Harvard only takes action when the speech ""crosses into conduct that amounts to bullying, harassment, intimidation"". Ms Stefanik had previously asked about contentious phrases commonly used by some members of the Pro-Palestinian movement, which Dr Gay said she found personally ""abhorrent"".  Dr Gay and the other college presidents also stated their support for Israel and opposition to antisemitism, but Dr Gay said her comments during the now viral exchange with Ms Stefanik were a mistake. ""What I should have had the presence of mind to do in that moment was return to my guiding truth, which is that calls for violence against our Jewish community — threats to our Jewish students — have no place at Harvard, and will never go unchallenged,"" she said in her interview with the Harvard Crimson. Dr Gay and the other leaders' testimony has since sparked growing backlash both on and off campus. Harvard Hillel, a Jewish campus organisation, said in a statement on Tuesday that the testimony ""calls into question [Dr Gay's] ability to protect Jewish students on Harvard's campus"". And on Thursday, Rabbi David Wolpe - who had only weeks earlier joined a Harvard advisory group to combat antisemitism - resigned citing Dr Gay's ""painfully inadequate testimony"". Rabbi Wolpe told BBC Newshour that ""an ideology of wokeism and attendant antisemitism is deeply rooted"" in the culture of Harvard and other elite institutions. He noted that these colleges had spoken out against racism in recent years but retreated to ""transparently hypocritical"" defences of free speech on more contentious issues.  Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania and MIT now all face official congressional investigations on their efforts to address antisemitism. University of Pennsylvania President Elizabeth Magill is also facing a call to resign by an advisory board to the university's influential Wharton business school. A top donor at the school has vowed to withdraw a $100m donation because of her comments.

1727,2023-12-18 14:34:30+00:00,/news/world-middle-east-67745092,"Three Israeli hostages mistakenly killed by soldiers in Gaza on Friday had used leftover food to write signs pleading for help, Israel says. The men had been staying at the building next to where they were shot ""for some period of time"", according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).  The head of the IDF told troops that they are ""absolutely not"" permitted to shoot those surrendering.   ""The IDF doesn't shoot a person who raises their hands,"" said Herzi Halevi. He said Gazans with a white flag must be arrested and not shot ""if they lay down their arms and raise their hands"".  About 120 hostages are believed to be still in captivity in the Gaza Strip, held by Hamas and allied Palestinian groups. Israel is under increasing pressure for a deal to free more hostages. Israeli officials have admitted that killing the three men who were holding a white flag was a breach of ""rules of engagement"".  They were seized and taken to Gaza during the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed around 1,200 in southern Israel. Israel has launched a massive retaliatory operation it says is aimed at destroying Hamas.  More than 18,000 people have been killed in Gaza since, according to the local health authorities, with hundreds of thousands of others pushed out of their homes.  The Israeli hostages - Yotam Haim, 28, Samer Talalka, 22, and Alon Shamriz, 26 - were killed in the Shejaiya neighbourhood of Gaza City on Friday as Israeli troops face stiff resistance. According to an Israeli military official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, the men emerged shirtless from a building, with one carrying a stick with a white cloth. One of the soldiers, the official added, felt threatened, as the men were at a distance of tens of metres, declared them ""terrorists"" and opened fire. Two were immediately killed while the third, wounded, returned to the building. A cry for help was heard in Hebrew and the battalion commander ordered the troops to cease fire. The wounded hostage later re-emerged, and was shot and killed, the official said. It is not clear if the hostages had been abandoned by their captors or escaped.  On Sunday, the IDF said a search of the building was carried out, revealing the messages ""SOS"" and ""Help, 3 hostages"" written on fabric. Officials believe the hostages had been there for some time. Since the end of a temporary ceasefire between Israel and Hamas earlier this month, families of the hostages have urged the Israeli government to reach a new truce for at least some of the captives to be freed. The initial deal led to the release of more than 100 hostages, in exchange for Palestinians held in Israeli jails. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has deflected the calls, insisting ""military pressure is necessary both for the return of the hostages and for victory"". Amid mounting Palestinian civilian casualties, Israeli authorities have come under growing international pressure, including from the country's main ally, the US. On Sunday, France's Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna went to Israel calling for an ""immediate and durable truce"".   Her Israeli counterpart Eli Cohen said a ceasefire would be an error, describing it as a gift to Hamas.  The UK and Germany have also called for a ""sustainable ceasefire"", whilst stopping short of saying it should be immediate. Vast areas of the Gaza Strip have been destroyed by the Israeli bombardment, and the United Nations has warned of a humanitarian catastrophe amid widespread shortages of basic supplies. Images on social media on Sunday showed Gaza residents climbing on aid lorries. With no let-up in the fighting, the IDF published images of what it said was Hamas's largest attack tunnel so far.  The tunnel - in some places wide enough for cars to pass through - was some 400m from the Erez border crossing with Israel, the IDF said.",Hostages shot by IDF used food to write 'SOS' sign,Israel Gaza: Hostages shot by IDF put out 'SOS' sign written with leftover food,"israel,israel-gaza_war,hamas,gaza",http://bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-67745092,articles/article_1727.txt,results/article_1727.txt.json

The wait of their families has gripped Israel, as the military carries out its offensive against Hamas. Speaking at a news conference, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said there would be no let-up in the Israeli operations. ""Military pressure is necessary both for the return of the hostages and for victory. Without military pressure. . . we have nothing,"" he said. Hamas, for its part, said it had told mediators there would be no negotiations to release hostages ""unless the aggression against our people stops once and for all"".

A building with a message SOS was found in the area, and the authorities were investigating whether it was linked to the killed hostages. Meanwhile Wichian Temthong, a freed Thai hostage who was held with the three men, recalled his time with them, saying that, as they had no common language they used hand signals to communicate and give each other moral support. He was ""very shocked"" and ""saddened"" to learn of the deaths of the men he spent nearly 50 days in captivity with, he said.

1730,2023-12-15 06:00:15+00:00,/news/world-middle-east-67600015,"In a family home in Bethlehem, in the occupied West Bank, Yazen Alhasnat was sitting next to his mother rubbing sleep from his eyes.   The 17-year-old had been released from prison the night before, nearly five months after being arrested in a 4am Israeli military raid on the home.   Yazen had been held under ""administrative detention"" - a longstanding security policy, inherited from the British, that allows the Israeli state to imprison people indefinitely without charge, and without presenting any evidence against them.  ""They have a secret file,"" Yazen said. ""They don't tell you what's in it. ""  He was back at home because he was among the 180 Palestinian children and women released from prison by Israel in the recent exchange for hostages held by Hamas in Gaza.   But at the same time the Palestinian prisoners were being released, Israel was detaining people at its highest rate in years. In the weeks since 7 October, the number of people in administrative detention - already at a 30-year high of 1,300 - has shot up to more than 2,800.  When Yazen was released, his family was told not to publicly celebrate in any way or to talk to the media. The same instructions were given to the families of two other teenagers who spoke to the BBC about their experiences. But all three families said they wanted to highlight the issue of administrative detention.  Israel says that its use of the policy is compliant with international law and a necessary preventative measure to combat terrorism. Maurice Hirsch, a former director of military prosecutions for the West Bank, from 2013 to 2016, told the BBC that Israel was ""not only meeting international law but far surpassing it"", by allowing detainees to appeal and ensuring that their detentions were reviewed every six months. But human rights groups say Israel's expansive use of the measure is an abuse of a security law not designed to be employed at such scale, and that detainees cannot effectively defend themselves, or appeal, because they have no access to the evidence against them. ""Under international law, administrative detention should be a rare exception,"" said Jessica Montell, the executive director of HaMoked, an Israeli human rights organisation that monitors detention of Palestinians.   ""You are supposed to use it when there is a present danger and no other way to prevent that danger than detaining someone. But it is clear Israel is not using it that way. It is detaining hundreds, thousands of people, without charge, and using administrative detention to shield itself from scrutiny. ""  Palestinians have been subject to administrative detention in this region since 1945, first under the British Mandate and then in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The law has in some very rare instances been used against Israeli settlers, but it is overwhelmingly used to detain West Bank Palestinians, including children.   Administrative detainees are granted a hearing - at a military court, in front of an Israeli military judge - but the state is not required to disclose any of its evidence to the detainees or their lawyers. The detainees can then be sentenced to up to six months. But the six months can be extended indefinitely by the military court, meaning that administrative detainees have no real idea at any point how long they are going to be locked up.    ""What really gets to you is the uncertainty,"" Yazen said, sitting in his living room. ""Will you finish your six months and leave? Or will you be extended for a year, for two years?""   The detainees can mount an appeal, all the way up to Israel's Supreme Court, but with no access to the evidence against them, they have nothing to base it on. Palestinians who are formally tried in the military courts have more access to evidence, but the courts boast a roughly 99% conviction rate.   ""Defending Palestinians in the military courts is an almost impossible task,"" said Jerusalem-based defence lawyer Maher Hanna.   ""The entire system is designed to limit a Palestinian's capacity to defend himself. It imposes harsh constraints on the defence and relieves the state prosecutor of the burden of proof. ""   Israel's use of the policy in the West Bank had ""crossed all lines - red, green, every colour"", Yazen's mother Sadiah said.   ""We are living under a parallel system of justice. ""  When 16-year-old Osama Marmesh was detained, he was pulled off the street and into an unmarked car, he said. So for the first 48 hours of Osama's detention, his father Naif had no idea where he was. ""You call everyone you know to ask if they have seen your son,"" Naif said. ""You don't sleep. ""   Osama asked repeatedly during his arrest for the charges against him, he said, but was told each time to ""shut up"". When 17-year-old Musa Aloridat was arrested, in a 5am raid on his family home, Israeli forces pulled apart the bedroom he shared with his two younger brothers and fired a bullet into the wardrobe, smashing the glass, he said. ""They took him away in his underwear,"" Musa's father Muhannad said, holding up a picture on his phone. ""For three days we knew nothing. "" Neither Yazen, Osama nor Musa, nor their parents or lawyers, were shown any evidence against them during their months of detention. When Israel published lists of the detainees to be released in the recent exchanges, in the column detailing the charges, against Yazen, Osama and Musa's names there was only the vague line, ""Threat to the security of the area"".  Another version of the list said Yazen and Musa were suspected of being affiliated with Palestinian militant groups. When Osama was released, he was handed a brief charge sheet which said that on two occasions, months earlier, he had thrown a stone, ""half the size of his palm"", towards Israeli security positions.   Maurice Hirsch, the former director of military prosecutions, said that it would be wrong to draw any conclusions from the limited information available. ""There's a very stark difference between the openly available evidence against these terrorists and what the intelligence information carries,"" he said.   ""We see administrative detention being used by the Americans in Guantanamo, so we know that this measure is internationally recognised and accepted,"" he added. ""And since this is an internationally accepted measure, why should it be only Israel that is prevented from using it, when we are dealing with probably the highest terror threat that anyone has ever seen?""   In the end, Yazen, Osama and Musa spent between four and seven months in prison. All three said that conditions had been relatively comfortable until the Hamas attack on 7 October, when their bedsheets, blankets, extra clothes and most of their food rations were removed, and all communication with the outside world was cut off, in what they described as collective punishment for the attack.  Other detainees have alleged that they were beaten, tear-gassed or had dogs set on them.   The Israeli Prison Service confirmed that it had put the prisons into emergency mode and ""reduced the living conditions of the security prisoners"" in response to the Hamas attack.  Yazen, Osama and Musa were all released early, because the exchange for Israeli hostages prioritised women and children. But, according to the most recent numbers from the prison service, there are still 2,873 people being held under administrative detention in Israeli jails. The day after he got home, Musa was back in his room, where he had been grabbed from his bed by the Israeli military four months earlier. The wardrobe doors, smashed by a bullet, had been taken off to be replaced, but the room had otherwise been put back together carefully by his parents. Musa had expected to be in prison much longer, he said. His lawyer had told him there was a 90% chance his detention would be extended.   All three boys said they wanted to try to finish school. But living under the constant threat of being locked up again was its own ""kind of psychological detention"", Musa said.   ""They released us into a bigger prison"", Yazen said.   ""There is no peace,"" Yazen's mother said, looking over at him. ""They can take you at any time. ""   Muath al-Khatib contributed to this report.

1731,2023-12-06 15:53:39+00:00,/news/world-middle-east-67635670,"It is well over 1,000 miles from the coast of Yemen to the Gaza Strip, and yet what happened last Sunday at the southern end of the Red Sea has the potential to dramatically escalate the war between Israel and Hamas. According to US Central Command, the division of the US Department of Defence that covers the Middle East, Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen carried out four attacks on three commercial ships operating in international waters. The attacks involved a combination of explosive drones and anti-ship ballistic missiles. The US Navy already had a guided missile destroyer in the vicinity, the USS Carney, which managed to shoot down three of the drones. Others hit their targets, causing some damage but no casualties. ""These attacks"" said the Pentagon, ""represent a direct threat to international commerce and maritime security. "" In a further statement it added that it believed the attacks from Yemen were ""enabled by Iran"".  The location of the attacks is significant. They took place just north of the strategic chokepoint of the Bab El Mandeb Strait, a 20-mile wide channel that separates Africa from the Arabian Peninsula and through which about 17,000 ships and 10% of global trade pass every year. Any ship passing through the Suez Canal and heading on south to the Indian Ocean has to pass this strait, close to the coast of Yemen. So what was behind these attacks and what exactly is the link to Gaza? Most of the populated parts of Yemen, including its Red Sea coast, have been under the control of a tribal militia known as the Houthis which overthrew the legitimate, elected Yemeni government in late 2014. They are backed by Iran which has allegedly been supplying them with weapons and training, including drone and missile technology, just as it has with Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. The Houthi coup triggered a catastrophic civil war that has dragged on for more than nine years, causing thousands of casualties and triggering a humanitarian disaster. While Iran backs the Houthis, Saudi Arabia and the UAE went to war against them in 2015, backed by the US and UK, in an unsuccessful bid to restore the internationally recognised government. During this war the Houthis have fired numerous long-range missiles and drones at targets in Saudi Arabia, the UAE and inside Yemen, hitting civil airports, towns and petrochemical infrastructure as well as military targets. Following the outbreak of the latest Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza on 7 October, the Houthis declared their support for what they called ""their brothers in Gaza"" and have fired missiles and drones towards Eilat and other targets in Israel. These were intercepted by the US Navy's USS Carney which shot them down.  But the Houthis have also targeted any shipping which they suspect of having Israeli connections. In November they landed troops by helicopter on the deck of a cargo ship, the Galaxy Leader, and seized it. They have vowed to prevent any Israeli vessels from passing their coast and in a statement on Sunday their military spokesman said the vessels they fired missiles at were attacked because they were ""Israeli"". Israel's military denied any connection between its government and the ships but media reports say there are some private commercial links with wealthy Israeli businessmen. The US has said subsequently it is ""considering all appropriate responses in full coordination with its allies and partners"".  In practice, Washington will be reluctant to raise tensions any further in a region already nervous about spill-over from the war in Gaza. But if the Houthis in Yemen continue to fire missiles beyond their borders, then eventually the US may decide it needs to retaliate by targeting those missile launch sites. If that happens then there follows the risk that Iran, which supports the Houthis, could also retaliate, potentially leading to the nightmare scenario of a direct conflict between Iran and the US. For now, this is something both sides wish to avoid.",How missiles from Yemen could escalate Israel-Gaza war,How missiles from Yemen could escalate Israel-Gaza war,"israel,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-67635670,articles/article_1731.txt,results/article_1731.txt.json
1732,2023-12-01 11:50:06+00:00,/news/world-middle-east-67565872,"Satellite images commissioned by the BBC reveal the extent of destruction across Gaza, showing that nearly 98,000 buildings may have suffered damage. The satellite images were taken last Thursday - before the start of a seven-day suspension of hostilities, which has now ended.  Drone footage and verified video also show buildings and entire neighbourhoods reduced to rubble after Israeli air strikes and on-the-ground fighting. While northern Gaza has been the focus of the Israeli offensive and has borne the brunt of the destruction, widespread damage extends across the entire strip.  Israel says northern Gaza, which includes the major urban centre of Gaza City, was a ""centre of gravity of Hamas"", the group behind the deadly 7 October attacks on Israel. The Israeli military says its bombing campaign has successfully targeted Hamas commanders and fighters and accuses the group of embedding itself in civilian areas. Satellite data analysis suggests that almost 98,000 buildings across the whole Gaza Strip may have suffered damage, mostly in the north - as shown in the above map.  Analysis of the data was carried out by Corey Scher of City University of New York Graduate Center and Jamon Van Den Hoek of Oregon State University. It is based on comparisons of two separate images, revealing changes in the height or structure of buildings which suggests damage. We have analysed satellite imagery from several areas with extensive damage.  The cities of Beit Lahia and Beit Hanoun in the north and north-east of the Gaza Strip were among the first to be targeted by air strikes after the 7 October attacks by Hamas. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the area was a hideout for Hamas.  Parts of Beit Lahia, which overlooked olive groves and sand dunes stretching towards the border with Israel, were flattened. The satellite image below shows an area in the north-east of Beit Lahia, where a significant block of buildings was destroyed.  Bulldozers appear to have cleared roads through the rubble and the Israeli military cleared land and set up defensive positions in surrounding fields. The IDF also struck the small nearby city of Beit Hanoun, less than 1.6km (1 mile) from the border. It said 120 targets were hit in the area on the first day of air strikes. As the images above show, a skyline of multi-storey buildings and a mosquewas gradually reduced to rubble between 14 October and 22 November. After weeks of air strikes on Gaza, Israel moved in on the ground - tanks and bulldozers going through areas which had been heavily bombarded. The IDF worked its way southwards along the coast towards Shati (Beach) refugee camp, in the Gaza City area.  As the image below shows, a whole series of craters are visible in what was once a residential area. Some of the buildings on the beach front, which boasted Gaza's first five-star hotel, the Al-Mashtal, as well as huts and restaurants, appear to have been partially destroyed.  About a week after the air strikes began, the IDF warned Palestinians in northern Gaza to move south of a river known as Wadi Gaza for their own safety.  Despite the warning and hundreds of thousands of people fleeing Gaza City, areas in the south continued to be targeted.  Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza was hit several times before the temporary pause in hostilities began. The camp was said to be home to about 85,000 people, according to the UN. In this verified video, which emergedonline, people are seen picking through the rubble of collapsed and damaged buildings. The distinctive black chimney stacks of the Gaza Power Plant, situated just north of the camp, are visible in the background. The BBC has approached the IDF for comment.  In Khan Younis, in southern Gaza, thousands of people are living in tents or the rubble of bombed-out buildings.  Although the damage was not as widespread as in the north, up to 15% of buildings across the city may have been damaged, according to Corey Scher and Jamon Van Den Hoek's analysis.  As well as pushing down from the north, Israeli forces also cut across the Gaza Strip westwards, isolating Gaza City from the south. In this image below, taken to the south of Gaza City, we can see that a previously populated residential area was cleared by the IDF with heavy machinery and a road bulldozed towards the western Mediterranean shoreline. You can also see dozens of military vehicles, including tanks, grouped behind fortifications made from earth. Satellite images also show an open square of land with a Star of David carved into the earth by vehicle tracks in Gaza City, near al-Azhar University.  Images online from before the war showed children playing there and suggested it was a park, but IDF spokesman Rear Adm Daniel Hagari said the ground was used by Hamas as a parade square near a base. The area was taken over by the IDF's Golani Brigade.  A Star of David - which is used as a Jewish and Israeli symbol - was made by armoured vehicles in a ceremony in memory of Israeli soldiers who had been killed since the war began, according to a post by Rear Adm Hagari on X.

In the video, verified by the BBC, much of the Great Omari Mosque appears to be reduced to rubble, with only its minaret still intact. Hamas officials accused Israel of committing a ""heinous, barbaric crime"". The Israeli military has not commented. The mosque opened in the 7th Century on the site of a Byzantine church. Located in Gaza City's old town, the mosque was destroyed several times in various conflicts and once by an earthquake, but was rebuilt each time. It is named after Omar, Islam's second caliph. Gaza's Hamas-run antiquities ministry has accused Israel of bombing the enclave's historical and archaeological sites, urging the UN's cultural agency Unesco to help protect such sites. Israel has accused Hamas of using mosques, schools and other civilian infrastructure to hide its fighters. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) launched its military operation in Gaza after a deadly Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October. Israel says 1,200 people were killed and 240 taken hostage in the Hamas attack. A number of hostages were later released during a short-lived ceasefire.

The Iran-backed group hijacked the Galaxy Leader in the Red Sea in November, saying it was Israeli.  Houthi militia members had earlier threatened to target Israeli ships over its war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Israel denied the claim, while Japan's government said it was operated by Nippon Yusen. Images taken by Reuters and EPA news agencies appear to show people exploring the large vessel. Nippon Yusen, also known as NYK Line, has said the ship was carrying 25 crew members when it was seized near Hodeida in Yemen on its way to India. Those on board are believed to include Bulgarian, Mexican, Filipino and Ukrainian nationals. Japan's government said in November that its ministries and agencies were working with the relevant countries for the early release of the vessel and its crew. Galaxy Leader is owned by Galaxy Maritime Ltd, which is registered in the Isle of Man. It is owned by Ray Car Carriers, which is co-owned by Israeli businessman Abraham Ungar, according to documents from the Isle of Man government's companies registry. Images from on board have shown large groups of people entering and leaving the ship by motor boat, as well as several Yemenis armed with rifles walking the deck.

1735,2023-12-04 16:19:23+00:00,/news/world-middle-east-67614139,"Medics working in the Gaza Strip are using a specific phrase to describe a particular kind of war victim.  ""There's an acronym that's unique to the Gaza Strip, it's WCNSF - wounded child, no surviving family - and it's not used infrequently,"" Dr Tanya Haj-Hassan who works with Doctors Without Borders told BBC News. The expression captures the horror of the situation for many Gazan children. Their lives change in a second - their parents, siblings and grandparents are killed, and nothing is the same ever again. The war began after Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October killing 1,200 people and taking around 240 others hostage, and Israel launched its military campaign. More than 15,500 people have been killed in the conflict, including about 6,000 children, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. Ahmed Shabat is one of those children who was described as a wounded child, with no surviving family, when he arrived injured and crying at the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza. The three-year-old survived an air strike on his home in Beit Hanoun, in mid-November. But his father, mother and older brother were killed. Miraculously, at the time he had only minor injuries. Later it was revealed his younger brother Omar, aged two, had also survived the strike and they were reunited after an adult member of the wider family was located. ""After the bombing, we learned there was a child in the Indonesian hospital with no-one accompanying him, so we went there immediately,"" Ahmed's uncle Ibrahim Abu Amsha explained. ""Ahmed was with a stranger. He said Ahmed had been blown into the air and was found injured about 20m (65ft) from the house. ""  Ahmed and Omar were now orphans, homeless, with no shelter to protect them from continuous shelling, so Ibrahim decided to look after them, along with his own family. He initially took them to Sheikh Radwan city but said they left after ""Ahmed was hit by glass fragments"" from an explosion. They then went to Nuseirat camp to stay in a UN-affiliated school. But even in their new location, they were hit again, with devastating consequences for Ahmed. ""I ran out of the school's door and saw Ahmed in front of me on the ground, both legs gone. He was crawling towards me, opening his arms, seeking help. "" A family member, who was with Ahmed at the time of the blast, was killed. Ibrahim, who is still displaced with his own family as well as his sister's children, says he dreams of being able to send Ahmed for treatment outside Gaza.  ""He wanted to be many things,"" his uncle said sadly. ""When we went out together to attend football matches, he said he wished to become a famous football player. "" Like Ahmed, Muna Alwan is also a war orphan and was described as WCNSF when she arrived at the Indonesian Hospital. The two-year-old constantly cries ""Mama"", but her mum is dead. Muna was pulled from under the rubble after an air strike hit a neighbour's house in the Jabal al-Rais area of northern Gaza. Muna's parents, brother and grandfather were killed. Muna's eye was badly injured and her jaw fractured.  Muna was transferred to another hospital where she was tracked down by her aunt Hanaa. ""We knew through the internet that Muna was at Nasser Hospital. We came, and we recognised her,"" Hanaa explains. But she says her niece is suffering terribly.  ""She just wants to scream, always afraid, especially if someone approaches her,"" Hanaa adds. Muna does have older sisters who are alive but they are in Gaza City. ""They are stuck and there is no way to bring them to the south,"" Hanaa says, adding: ""I constantly ask myself, what will we do? How do we compensate for her mother?"" On a metal bed in the corner of a room at Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis, southern Gaza, 11-year-old Dunya Abu Mehsen looks at what remains of her right leg wrapped in white bandages. The girl, with long curly hair, sits at the edge of the bed, wearing a velvety red dress, silent most of the time, appearing deeply sad. Dunya survived an air strike with her brother, Yusuf, and her younger sister that hit when they were all sleeping at their home in the al-Amal neighbourhood in Khan Yunis, southern Gaza.  But her parents, brother and sister were killed. She also lost her right leg. ""When I saw my dad, I was scared because he was covered in blood and stones. People were standing around us, and my sister was screaming,"" Dunya recounts. ""I looked at myself and I didn't have a leg. I felt pain and my only thought was: 'How did I lose my leg?'"" ""Dunya doesn't recall how and when she arrived at the hospital, but she remembers being there alone, and the medical staff repeatedly asking her questions in an attempt to identify her family,"" explains her aunt Fadwa Abu Mehsen.  ""She told me: 'I heard the nurse say, 'may God have mercy on them'. I knew she meant my mum and dad. '"" Her aunt, sitting beside her in the hospital room with the wheelchair that has become the only means for the little girl to go outside and breathe fresh air, says: ""She used to be playful, strong and very active before her injury. "" Dunya says: ""Today, I lost my leg and my family but I still have dreams. I want to get a prosthetic leg, travel, become a doctor, and for this war to end and our children to live in peace. '"" Determining the precise number of orphaned children in the Gaza Strip is challenging given the ""intensity of hostilities and rapidly evolving situation on the ground"", according to Ricardo Pires, the communication manager at the UN children's fund Unicef. Mr Pires adds that the organisation attempted to reach hospitals and health staff in Gaza to identify and register children, but ""these efforts are proceeding very slowly due to the extremely challenging conditions"".  He explained not only was it ""almost impossible"" to identify safe, temporary care arrangements due to ""chaotic and overcrowded"" shelters and hospitals, but ""the normal system to identify document, trace and reunite children with relatives is barely functional"".

1736,2023-12-13 21:14:10+00:00,/news/world-middle-east-67708700,"Israel's foreign minister has said it will continue the war in Gaza ""with or without international support"". A ceasefire at this stage of the conflict would be ""a gift"" to Hamas and allow it to return, Eli Cohen warned. Israel is facing mounting pressure over the number of Palestinian civilians killed by its military in Gaza and the worsening humanitarian crisis there. On Tuesday, the UN General Assembly overwhelmingly adopted a resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire. And in his strongest comments yet, US President Joe Biden said Israel was losing support worldwide because of its ""indiscriminate bombing"" of Gaza. Intense fighting continued in both the north and south of Gaza on Wednesday, while heavy rains worsened conditions for the hundreds of thousands of displaced people who are living in makeshift tents or out in the open. A senior UN aid official also warned that the Palestinian territory faced a ""public health disaster"" because of the collapse of its medical system and the spread of infectious diseases in overcrowded shelters. The war was triggered by an unprecedented attack by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October, in which at least 1,200 people - including many women and children - were killed and about 240 taken hostage. Since then, more than 18,600 people have been killed in Gaza, about 70% of them women and children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. At Tuesday's emergency session of the UN General Assembly, 153 member states voted in favour of a non-binding resolution demanding an ""immediate humanitarian ceasefire"" in Gaza, and ""the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages, as well as ensuring humanitarian access"". Eight states joined Israel and the US in voting against the resolution, including Austria and the Czech Republic, while the UK and Germany were among the 23 states which abstained.  It was put forward by Arab and Muslim states after the US vetoed a binding resolution at the UN Security Council last Friday, saying an immediate ceasefire would allow Hamas to regroup.  The day after the General Assembly vote and President Biden's warning, Eli Cohen told a visiting diplomat: ""Israel will continue the war against Hamas, with or without international support. "" ""A ceasefire at the current stage is a gift to the terrorist organisation Hamas, and will allow it to return and threaten the residents of Israel,"" he added, according to a statement from his office. So far, the US has supported Israel's opposition to a pause in hostilities. But senior American officials are increasingly demonstrating discontent with the way Israel is conducting its offensive.  On 2 December, Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin warned that Israel risked replacing a ""tactical victory with a strategic defeat"" if it did not sufficiently protect civilians in Gaza. Disagreements are also emerging about what a post-war Gaza will look like.  On Thursday, White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan will arrive in Israel for talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.  Israeli media report that their discussions will include a timetable for the end of the war - and some suggest that Mr Netanyahu, by openly disagreeing with the Biden administration, is trying to appeal to his right-wing base. Speaking with Israeli military commanders serving in Gaza on Tuesday afternoon, Mr Netanyahu said the war would ""continue until the end, until the victory, until the elimination of Hamas"".  And, reflecting ""international pressures"", he added that ""nothing will stop us"".  However, as previous Israeli wars show, calls for a ceasefire will soon become too loud to be ignored. Israel is continuing to pound Gaza in the meantime, but Hamas and its allies are fighting back. Tuesday was the deadliest day for the Israeli military since its ground offensive began on 27 October. The military said 10 soldiers were killed, almost all of them in a co-ordinated ambush in the Shejaiya district of Gaza City, where there has been a focus of the ground operation in recent days. Hamas fighters ""threw explosives at the soldiers and shot at them from inside a residential building in which underground terror infrastructure was also located"", according to a statement. Hamas said the announcement confirmed the ""failure"" of Israel's leaders and military in the face of ""strong resistance"" from the group's armed wing. The UN's local humanitarian co-ordinator, Lynn Hastings, told reporters: ""What is happening on the ground is not going to bring peace and security to either the Palestinians or Israelis for many, many years, if not generations to come. So a ceasefire is in the interest of everybody at the moment. "" She warned that the number of Palestinians being killed and injured was going up significantly every day and that almost half of Gaza's 2.3 million population had fled to the southern Rafah area, on the border with Egypt, in an attempt to avoid the Israeli bombardment. The collapse of the healthcare system, with only one-third of hospitals partially functioning, combined with the unsanitary conditions at overcrowded shelters, also meant there was ""a textbook formula for epidemics and a public health disaster"", she added. The UN estimates there have so far been 360,000 cases of infectious diseases, including meningitis, respiratory infections and diarrhoea, which is a leading cause of death among children under the age of five worldwide.",Israel FM: War to continue with or without support,"Israel to continue Gaza war with or without international support, FM says","israel,palestinian_territories,israel_and_the_palestinians,israel-gaza_war,hamas,gaza",http://bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-67708700,articles/article_1736.txt,results/article_1736.txt.json
1737,2023-12-12 13:04:01+00:00,/news/world-middle-east-67691219,"Israel is on holiday. Schools are out, and away from the frontline areas the shopping centres are full. Cake shops are bursting with the doughnuts that Jews like to eat during Hanukkah, the current religious festival. It is different the closer you get to the fighting. Along the Gaza border, the area known by Israelis as the ""envelope"", tanks and troops are moving, civilians are mostly elsewhere and it looks like a war zone.  In the north, along the border with Lebanon, communities have also been evacuated and the military continues to exchange fire with Iran's strongest ally, Hezbollah.  But casual visitors might be able to deceive themselves that life has somehow returned to ""normal"" in central Israel, the broad swathe of land between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.  A sharp reminder of how wrong that impression would be came as I drove down to Tel Aviv.  The air raid sirens started, and the red alert app Israelis have on their phones sent out warnings as cars swerved onto the hard shoulder so the people inside could stop to take cover. Other drivers accelerated to speed out of the area. In the confusion, three cars managed to crash into each other.  We pulled over as a group of women left their car and held each other in a tight, terrified embrace.  Overhead, vapour trails from the Iron Dome anti-missile system arched towards the rockets coming from Gaza, loud explosions cracking across a deep blue sky as they downed most of the projectiles. One man was injured, in Holon, just off the highway.  The fact that Hamas can still attack Israel is more proof that it is not beaten. The response of the motorists shows the depth of the trauma Hamas has inflicted on Israel, which is without doubt good news for the leaders of Hamas. Israel believes they are somewhere under Gaza, in some part of the tunnel system.  ""First of all, forget everything you thought you knew about Israel before 7 October. It's all changed,"" Amos Yadlin, a retired major-general said as we set up for an interview in his office in Tel Aviv, overlooking Israel's defence ministry. Mr Yadlin was a veteran fighter pilot who retired as head of Israeli military intelligence.  We decided to interview him to get an idea of Israel's war strategy. In the end everything he said was just as interesting for what it said about mood in Israel.  Mr Yadlin repeatedly compared Israel's fight against Hamas to World War Two. He was defending the huge number of killings by Israel of Palestinian civilians in the Gaza Strip, and making the point that eliminating Hamas was vital for Israel's future.  In a reference to the destruction of Dresden in Germany by the RAF in 1945, Mr Yadlin said: ""You bombed Dresden with 120,000 people, killed women, children. We are trying to avoid this collateral damage. We ask them to leave. We ask them to go to the southern part of Gaza. ""  I reminded him that Israel was also bombing the areas they had told Palestinians would be safe. Mr Yadlin insisted Israel was bombing Hamas, not civilians.  ""No, we didn't bomb them. We bombed the Hamas targets. Only Hamas targets and Hamas uses them as a human shield. "" He dismissed criticisms by the Biden administration in the US that Israel was killing too many Palestinian civilians. He said Israel was more careful about avoiding civilian casualties than the US and UK had been when they were bombing jihadist groups in Syria and Iraq.  His interpretation is not shared by former generals involved in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. A senior British officer told me he was appalled by Israel's disdain for the laws of war that mandate the protection of civilians. He said it would not be allowed in the British army.  Amos Yadlin, who still advises his successors in the Israeli military, believes Israel needs more time to reach its ambitious objectives in Gaza. It wants to rescue its hostages, kill the leaders of Hamas, annihilate it as a military formation that can threaten Israelis and destroy its capacity to govern.  I pointed out that even though the US had vetoed the latest ceasefire resolution it was signalling that Israel had weeks not months to finish what it wanted to do.  ""It is not enough to achieve the goal,"" said Mr Yadlin. ""If there is a ceasefire without returning the rest of the hostages, there will be no ceasefire. ""  Israel has an immensely powerful army and the backing of the US. But it is discovering that for all its deep conviction that it has no choice other than to destroy Gaza to eradicate Hamas, allies as well as critics are appalled by the way it has killed more than 18,000 Palestinians, of which perhaps half were children.  Israel has also discovered, as the Americans and others warned, that fighting a determined and prepared enemy in a built-up area is one of the hardest military jobs.  As Amos Yadlin indicated, though, the Israelis look determined to push through the criticism to reach their objectives. After that comes the thorny issue about the governance and reconstruction of Gaza.  Mr Yadlin said there would be no long Israeli occupation of Gaza, but if the current leadership's determination to control the strip for the foreseeable future does not change, occupation looks certain.

1739,2023-12-18 20:42:10+00:00,/news/uk-67745408,"Israel has ""gone beyond self-defence"" and lost the moral authority in its war with Hamas, the chair of the Commons foreign affairs committee has said. Tory MP Alicia Kearns told the BBC she thinks Israel has broken international law and risks increasing support for Hamas among Palestinians. She said: ""Bombs don't obliterate an ideology and neither can a stable state be constructed from oblivion. "" Former Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has also criticised Israel's tactics. Writing in the Daily Telegraph, he said Israel's legal basis for military action in Gaza was ""being undermined"" and warned its government was ""making the mistake of losing its moral authority alongside its legal one"". Asked if she agreed with Mr Wallace that Israel has damaged its standing with its conduct in Gaza, Ms Kearns told BBC Radio 4's World At One: ""I think unfortunately it has.  ""International humanitarian law in my view has been broken. "" She said a truce that could be turned into a lasting ceasefire should be pursued, rather than a focus on the eradication of Hamas - which Israel, the UK, US and some other Western powers class as a terrorist organisation. Ten Tory MPs - including former Cabinet ministers Kit Malthouse and George Eustice - have written to the Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron urging him to push for an ""immediate ceasefire"", describing Israel's strategy as ""neither proportionate nor targeted"". Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted operations, which were launched when Hamas carried out an unprecedented assault on Israel on 7 October, will continue until the group is dismantled. Around 1,200 people were killed and an estimated 240 people were taken hostage by Hamas - and despite some being returned during a temporary truce, about 120 are still thought to be inside Gaza. Ms Kearns - who chairs the committee of MPs tasked with holding the Foreign Office to account - warned Israel could inadvertently increase support for Hamas among Palestinians.  She said: ""Hamas is an ideology which recruits into its membership. "" An opinion poll carried out between 22 November and 2 December by a respected Palestinian think tank, the Palestinian Centre for Policy and Survey Research, found that support for Hamas had more than tripled in the occupied West Bank compared to three months ago. Supporters of Hamas were still in a minority, but 70% of the respondents said armed struggle was the best means of ending the Israeli occupation. Israel has come under growing international pressure over the scale of civilian casualties in Gaza, which Hamas-controlled authorities put at more than 19,400. The same authorities claimed 110 people were killed on Sunday in Israeli air strikes on the Jabalia refugee camp, which had been the largest settlement for displaced people prior to the current fighting.  The retaliatory Israeli offensive has seen much of northern Gaza damaged and 85% of the territory's 2.3 million population driven from their homes. On Sunday, Lord Cameron signalled a shift in tone from the government by calling for a ""sustainable ceasefire"" - echoing a form of words Prime Minister Rishi Sunak used in the Commons last week. Writing in the Sunday Times, the foreign secretary said: ""Our goal cannot simply be an end to fighting today. It must be peace lasting for days, years, generations. "" Speaking to reporters during a visit to Scotland on Monday, Mr Sunak called for Israel to respect humanitarian law, adding: ""It's clear that too many civilian lives have been lost and nobody wants to see this conflict go on a day longer than it has to. "" The government has consistently stopped short of calling for a full ceasefire, saying it respects Israel's right to self-defence. Israeli government spokesman Eylon Levy pushed back against Mr Wallace's criticism, describing his choice of words as ""unfortunate language"". He told the BBC said allowing Hamas to ""literally get away with murder"" would be more likely to radicalise people than Israel's military tactics.  However, Husam Zomlot, the head of the Palestinian mission to the UK, accused the Israeli army of normalising ""the mass murder of children, [and] women"" and ""the mass destruction of hospitals, schools, churches, mosques"".","Israel has gone beyond self-defence, Tory MP says","Israel has gone beyond self-defence in Gaza, Tory MP Alicia Kearns says",israel-gaza_war,http://bbc.co.uk/news/uk-67745408,articles/article_1739.txt,results/article_1739.txt.json
1740,2023-12-12 23:51:58+00:00,/news/world-us-canada-67699255,"US President Joe Biden has said Israel is starting to lose global support over its ""indiscriminate bombing"" of Gaza. His comments, made to donors at a fundraising event on Tuesday, marked his strongest criticism yet of Israel's leadership.  Mr Biden has offered unwavering public support to the country since Hamas launched its attacks on 7 October. And while he reiterated that Israel could count on US backing, he issued a direct warning to its government. ""Israel's security can rest on the United States, but right now it has more than the United States. It has the European Union, it has Europe, it has most of the world,"" he told donors to his 2024 re-election campaign in Washington. ""But they're starting to lose that support by indiscriminate bombing that takes place,"" he said. Mr Biden, however, added that there was ""no question about the need to take on Hamas"" and Israel had ""every right"" to do so. The US leader has faced growing pressure, including from within his own Democratic Party, to rein in Israel's military campaign. His remarks align with his administration's recent approach to the war, with officials urging Israel to ""put a premium on human life"" and give clearer instructions to allow people to avoid the conflict. Senior US officials have also displayed increasing discontent at Israel's military response. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has said more than 18,400 people have been killed by Israeli bombing since 7 October, when Hamas broke through Israel's heavily guarded perimeter and killed 1,200 people. In a statement later on Tuesday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel had received the ""full backing"" of the US for its ground war as well as its goal of destroying Hamas and recovering hostages. He added that Washington had blocked ""international pressure to stop the war"". ""Yes, there is disagreement about 'the day after Hamas' and I hope that we will reach [an] agreement here as well,"" he said. Mr Biden alluded to the pair's disagreement in his comments on Tuesday and said Mr Netanyahu had to ""change"" his government as well as his stance on a two-state solution, which top US officials have been promoting as the post-war path. That proposal is favoured by the international community to end the decades-long conflict, and would lead to the creation of an independent Palestinian state in Gaza and the West Bank existing alongside Israel. ""This is the most conservative government in Israel's history,"" Mr Biden said. ""This government in Israel is making it very difficult for him. They don't want a two-state solution. "" His comments reflect the emerging disagreements about what direction to take after the war. Mr Netanyahu has said he opposes US calls to have the Palestinian Authority, which currently administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, take over control of Gaza. While Mr Biden's words were his bluntest yet, senior American officials have increasingly expressed discontent with Israel's military campaign. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said just days ago that there was a ""gap"" between pledges by Israeli authorities to spare civilians in Gaza and the reality on the ground.",Israel losing global support over Gaza bombing - Biden,"Israel losing global support over Gaza bombing, Biden says","israel,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-67699255,articles/article_1740.txt,results/article_1740.txt.json
1741,2023-12-04 23:14:59+00:00,/news/world-middle-east-67614711,"Israel's military has ordered the evacuation of a fifth of the main city in southern Gaza, as it expands its ground offensive against Hamas. A map showed six northern and central areas of Khan Younis where an estimated 167,000 people needed to leave.  Witnesses also reported seeing tanks to the east, and a doctor said a local hospital was overwhelmed by casualties. In Gaza City, an unconfirmed report says 50 people were killed when Israeli air strikes hit two schools. According to the Palestinian news agency Wafa, they died in schools sheltering displaced people in the city's Daraj neighbourhood.  Reuters news agency has said that the strikes are still to be independently verified and that the Hamas-run health ministry could not be reached for comment. The Israeli army said it was looking into the report.  Many of Gaza's 2.3 million residents are sheltering in the south after being previously ordered to leave the north. The Israeli military said it would operate with ""maximum force"" in the south, as it had done in the north - where there has been widespread destruction over the past eight weeks. Israel launched a full-scale campaign in Gaza in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on 7 October, in which at least 1,200 people were killed and about 240 others taken hostage.  Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says almost 15,900 people have been killed in the territory since the war began, while the UN says a humanitarian catastrophe is unfolding. A temporary ceasefire that lasted for seven days, which led to the release of 105 of the hostages and 240 Palestinians held in Israeli jails, fell apart on Friday. BBC Gaza correspondent Rushdi Abu Alouf, who is currently in Istanbul, says about 200 Israeli air strikes were reported overnight. About 15 to 20 locations were targeted in and around Khan Younis, where the local population has swelled to as much as 1.2 million, according to local authorities. The central town of Deir al-Balah, about 8km (5 miles) to the north, was also bombed heavily. Dozens of casualties, including women and children, arrived at Khan Younis's Nasser Hospital from different areas. Many were dead or seriously injured. Mohammed Eid wiped tears from his bandaged face as he lined up among the mourners by bodies covered in white shrouds outside the hospital on Monday morning. ""We were sleeping safely, minding our own business. Suddenly, a bomb fell on us, and the whole building was destroyed,"" he told the BBC. ""My brother was torn into pieces, and so was his wife. My daughter was killed, and his daughters were killed, including his littlest. We can't find my mum, and my niece. "" Later, witnesses and local journalists in Gaza reported that they had seen Israeli tanks and armoured vehicles on the eastern outskirts of Khan Younis, by Abasan and Khuzaa, which is nearest to the boundary fence with Israel.   Moaz Mohammed told AFP news agency that he had seen tanks moving down the main north-south highway, Salah al-Din Road, which has been one of two Israeli-designated evacuation routes.  The tanks were ""firing bullets and tank shells at cars and people trying to move through the area"" between Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis, he said. At the same time, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) warned civilians to avoid a section of Salah al-Din Road in the same area, saying it now constituted a ""battlefield"" and was ""extremely dangerous"". The IDF also posted a map that ordered residents of six northern and central neighbourhoods of Khan Younis - al-Mahatta, al-Katiba, Hamad, al-Satir, Bani Suheila and Ma'in - to leave immediately to ""preserve your safety and security"".  According to the UN, the marked area in Khan Younis was home to almost 117,000 people before the war. It also includes 21 shelters where 50,000 displaced people are currently living. The map tells them to move to al-Fukhari, east of Khan Younis, and Rafah's al-Shaboura and Tal al-Sultan neighbourhoods, which are already overcrowded.  IDF chief spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a statement that Israeli forces were continuing to operate with ""maximum force against Hamas terrorists and infrastructure, while minimising harm to the civilians that Hamas places around them as shields"". ""We are dropping leaflets with QR codes that opens a map guiding Gazans to safer areas. The map is divided into neighbourhood numbers indicating where civilians in a specific area should go to avoid being in the crossfire,"" he added. The IDF has introduced the scheme because it is under heavy pressure from the US to protect civilians. However, our Gaza correspondent says he has spoken to Palestinians in the affected areas who are not aware of the map or cannot see it because there is no internet coverage. ""This is a joke, not a map, because we don't know where to go,"" a displaced person who was sheltering in Khan Younis told him. Meanwhile, an orthopaedic surgeon at the European Hospital in Khan Younis told the BBC that it was overwhelmed by hundreds of wounded. ""It is chaotic - we can't absorb any more patients and they keep coming,"" Dr Paul Ley said. ""We have more than 360 people on the operating list, which is impossible to deal with. ""  Dr Ley also said the hospital's corridors and grounds were full with 6,000 to 7,000 displaced people, some of whom were medics who had fled the north. ""Anaesthetics and pain killers are a big problem - we are running out slowly so we are lowering our safety standards. We never leave the hospital and our presence here has been notified to the Israelis, but shrapnel has reached the hospital,"" he added. Médecins Sans Frontières also warned that more than 100 dead and over 400 injured people had arrived at the emergency room of Al-Aqsa hospital in Deir al-Balah in the last 48 hours, and that there was no space for new patients. The UN said on Monday that four hospitals in the north were partially operating and admitting patients, with only limited services. The 12 hospitals in the south are partially functional, but bed capacity is only half what it was before the war and only one hospital can perform complex surgery.",Israel orders evacuations from city in south Gaza,Israel orders evacuations from city in south Gaza as offensive widens,"israel,israel_and_the_palestinians,israel-gaza_war,hamas",http://bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-67614711,articles/article_1741.txt,results/article_1741.txt.json
1746,2023-12-16 01:02:11+00:00,/news/world-middle-east-67732353,"The Israeli military says it has mistakenly killed three hostages during its campaign in Gaza after they were mis-identified as a ""threat"".   They were named as Yotam Haim, 28, Samer Talalka, 22, and Alon Shamriz, 26. The military shared its remorse and said the three were shot by troops operating in Shejaiya, in Gaza's north.  More than 100 hostages remain in captivity in Gaza after being captured in the 7 October attacks on Israel. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Friday's incident was under investigation, and that it ""expresses deep remorse over the tragic incident and sends the families its heartfelt condolences"". ""Our national mission is to locate the missing and return all the hostages home,"" it added. Hundreds of people gathered in central Tel Aviv following the announcement and marched to an IDF military base in the city, calling on the government to secure a deal for the release of the remaining hostages.  Demonstrators held candles and carried placards that read ""Bring [them] home"" and ""Hostage exchange now!"" The bodies of the three men have been returned to Israeli territory, where checks confirmed their identities. Yotam Haim, who was kidnapped from Kibbutz Kfar Aza on 7 October, was a musician who loved animals and cooking Italian food. On the morning of the Hamas attack, he called his family and told them that his house was on fire. When he opened the window for some fresh air, Yotam was kidnapped by Hamas. Speaking to the BBC before her son's death, his mother said they had messaged each other as they hid in their home shelters - before their connection was lost. Alon Shamriz was also at Kfar Aza at the time of the attack. His family gave permission for him to be named after asking earlier that his identity not be revealed. Samer Talalka, a Bedouin, was kidnapped from Kibbutz Nir Am. An avid motorcycle enthusiast, he loved to travel in the countryside and spend time with friends.  He lived in the town of Hura and worked at a chicken hatchery in the kibbutz. On the morning of 7 October, he was at work. He called his sister after the attack to tell her that he had been injured by gunfire. His father told local media they lost touch at 07:00 local time on the morning of the attacks. A photograph of him being led through Gaza was shared on Telegram. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called their deaths an ""unbearable tragedy"". ""Even on this difficult evening, we will bind up our wounds, learn the lessons and continue with a supreme effort to return all our abductees home safely,"" he said. White House spokesperson John Kirby said the killings were a ""tragic mistake,"" and that the US did not have ""perfect visibility on exactly how this operation unfolded"". More than 100 hostages remain in captivity in Gaza after being captured on 7 October when Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking 240 hostages - some of whom were released during a brief truce. The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry says more than 18,800 people have been killed and 50,000 injured in the enclave so far in the war that followed.  Hen Avigdori, whose wife and daughter were among the released, said he often heard people say hostages could be rescued ""by military means. "" But ""there is no military way"" that would bring them back safely, he wrote in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.

It also said fierce clashes were taking place in Jabalia and Shejaiya in northern Gaza in the heaviest day of fighting so far. Hamas said it had destroyed Israeli military vehicles and used snipers against troops. The UN says the situation in southern Gaza is getting worse and distributing food there is nearly impossible.  Hundreds of people have been killed since Israel began bombing southern Gaza last week after a temporary ceasefire ended. On Tuesday officials from the Hamas-run health ministry said at least 45 people had been killed in Israeli strikes on homes in the central city of Deir al-Balah. Hamas officials say at least 16,248 people have been killed in Gaza since the start of the conflict, including more than 7,000 children and nearly 5,000 women. Israel launched air strikes and a ground invasion of Gaza after Hamas attacked nearby military bases, kibbutzes and a music festival, killing about 1,200 people. The Israeli military says it is working to destroy Hamas in Gaza and rescue 138 hostages it says are being held in Gaza. However on Tuesday Israeli media reported that Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, had told relatives of those still being held that there was ""no possibility right now of bringing everyone home"". Before a temporary truce collapsed last Friday, the Israeli ground operation was focused on the north of Gaza. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) issued a blanket order to all 1.1 million people living there to move south and many went to Khan Younis. The Israeli government and military insists it is doing what it can to minimise civilian casualties in Gaza and blames Hamas for operating in densely populated areas. After several days of telling people in some parts of Khan Younis to leave, the Israeli military on Tuesday told them instead to remain in designated shelters and hospitals. ""Don't get out. Going out is dangerous. You have been warned,"" said the leaflets, addressed to residents of six city districts. It had previously told them to head towards Rafah near the border with Egypt and to an area near the coast called al-Mawasi. Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, said limits on the amount of aid allowed to enter Gaza from Egypt ""strangles our operations"".

PM Benjamin Netanyahu said he and his wife were ""broken-hearted"", and that Gal Eisenkot was a ""true hero"". In his statement, Mr Netanyahu added: ""Our heroes have not fallen in vain.

A map posted on social media on Monday told people in northern and central Khan Younis to leave immediately to ""preserve your safety and security"". Arrows directed them to move to three already overcrowded areas to the south and west. On Tuesday however, the Israeli military said its forces had already entered the city and it was now too dangerous to leave. ""Don't get out. Going out is dangerous. You have been warned,"" new leaflets said, warning people to stay inside designated shelters and hospitals. The evacuation of specific areas marked on online maps is part of a new approach the military says it is taking to avoid civilian casualties in its eight-week war with Hamas, following heavy pressure from the United States.  But there is concern that the strategy is too complicated, too dependent on technology, and too likely to cause panic to be a workable solution. BBC Gaza correspondent Rushdi Abu Alouf, who is currently in Istanbul, said he had spoken to relatives and other people in the affected areas who were not aware of the IDF's map or could not see it because of patchy internet access and no regular supply of electricity. ""This is a joke, not a map, because we don't know where to go,"" a displaced person who was sheltering in Khan Younis told him. There is also no guarantee they will be safe from bombardment if they flee. The main Palestinian telecommunications firm meanwhile said that all phone and internet services were cut once again. Before a temporary truce collapsed last Friday, the Israeli ground operation was focused on the north of Gaza. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) issued a blanket order to all 1.1 million people living there to move south of the Wadi Gaza river for their own safety.    Hundreds of thousands heeded the call as Israeli troops penetrated deep into Gaza City - with many of them eventually ending up in Khan Younis. The IDF also repeatedly urged civilians across Gaza to move to al-Mawasi, a thin strip of territory along the Mediterranean coast which officials described as a ""humanitarian zone"". During a visit to Israel on Thursday while the fighting was paused, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he had told Israeli leaders that they had to ""put in place humanitarian civilian protection plans that minimize further casualties of innocent Palestinians"".  These included ""clearly and precisely designating areas and places in southern and central Gaza where they can be safe and out of the line of fire"", he added.  The IDF's response was to publish on its Arabic-language website on Friday an ""Evacuation Zone Map"" that divided Gaza into more than 600 numbered blocks, ranging in size from about 0.03 to 25 sq km (0.001 to 9.6 sq miles).   Jets also dropped leaflets with QR codes, allowing people with a working smartphone and an internet connection to access the map - and also asking them to share their location. Asked about this approach on Monday, US state department spokesman Matthew Miller said it had ""seen improvements"".  ""We have seen them evacuate specific neighbourhoods, rather than entire areas, so the number of displaced persons will hopefully be lower in southern Gaza than it was in the north,"" he added. However the IDF's order for civilians to move from Khan Younis to Rafah was condemned by the head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, which runs the biggest humanitarian operation in Gaza and has 958,000 displaced people sheltering at 99 facilities in the south. ""The order created panic, fear and anxiety,"" warned Philippe Lazzarini on Monday evening. ""At least an additional 60,000 people were forced to move to already overcrowded Unrwa shelters, with more asking to be sheltered. "" ""The evacuation order pushes people to concentrate into what is less than one-third of the Gaza Strip,"" he added. Mr Lazzarini also stressed that ""no place is safe in Gaza, whether in the south, or the south-west, whether in Rafah or in any unilaterally called 'safe zone'"". Unicef spokesman James Elder, who was recently in Gaza, told the BBC on Tuesday that the idea of a ""safe zone"" was a ""dangerous false narrative"". He said that under international law Israel had to ensure places of evacuation had conditions for people to survive.  In an apparent reference to al-Mawasi, he added: ""These are tiny patches of barren land. They have no water, no facilities, no shelter from the cold, no sanitation. "" A senior adviser to Israel's prime minister rejected such criticism in a BBC interview on Monday. ""I don't believe that nowhere is safe,"" Mark Regev said. ""We've designated safer zones for people to go to. If you believe the Hamas propaganda, we're just hitting innocent buildings, right? But if we're hitting a structure, it's because there's Hamas either in or under the structure.

The IDF's response was to publish on its Arabic-language website on Friday an ""Evacuation Zone Map"" that divided Gaza into more than 600 numbered blocks, ranging in size from about 0.03 to 25 sq km (0.001 to 9.6 sq miles).   Jets also dropped leaflets with QR codes, allowing people with a working smartphone and an internet connection to access the map - and also asking them to share their location. Asked about this approach on Monday, US state department spokesman Matthew Miller said it had ""seen improvements"".  ""We have seen them evacuate specific neighbourhoods, rather than entire areas, so the number of displaced persons will hopefully be lower in southern Gaza than it was in the north,"" he added. However the IDF's order for civilians to move from Khan Younis to Rafah was condemned by the head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, which runs the biggest humanitarian operation in Gaza and has 958,000 displaced people sheltering at 99 facilities in the south. ""The order created panic, fear and anxiety,"" warned Philippe Lazzarini on Monday evening. ""At least an additional 60,000 people were forced to move to already overcrowded Unrwa shelters, with more asking to be sheltered. "" ""The evacuation order pushes people to concentrate into what is less than one-third of the Gaza Strip,"" he added. Mr Lazzarini also stressed that ""no place is safe in Gaza, whether in the south, or the south-west, whether in Rafah or in any unilaterally called 'safe zone'"". Unicef spokesman James Elder, who was recently in Gaza, told the BBC on Tuesday that the idea of a ""safe zone"" was a ""dangerous false narrative"". He said that under international law Israel had to ensure places of evacuation had conditions for people to survive.  In an apparent reference to al-Mawasi, he added: ""These are tiny patches of barren land. They have no water, no facilities, no shelter from the cold, no sanitation. "" A senior adviser to Israel's prime minister rejected such criticism in a BBC interview on Monday. ""I don't believe that nowhere is safe,"" Mark Regev said. ""We've designated safer zones for people to go to. If you believe the Hamas propaganda, we're just hitting innocent buildings, right? But if we're hitting a structure, it's because there's Hamas either in or under the structure. "" Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says 70% of the almost 15,900 people killed there since the start of the conflict have been women and children. Israel launched a military campaign in response to a cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on 7 October, in which at least 1,200 people - including many women and children - were killed and about 240 others taken hostage.

Khitam Attaallah Elian, from west London, was told more than half of her relatives had been killed in the middle of the night when her sister's home was destroyed. Her sister-in-law, two nieces and nephew survived. Mrs Attaallah Elian has now flown to Egypt to help as much as she can. Recalling the night she was told of their deaths in the bombing on 21 November, Mrs Attaallah Elian told the BBC: ""My daughter came to my room and turned on the light. She said, 'Mama, Aunt Ayah's house has been bombed'. ""I couldn't understand the news and started screaming. My daughter and husband tried to calm me down and I was asking, 'All of them? All of them?'"" Her family were among the first to leave their homes in Gaza since the outbreak of the most recent Israel-Gaza conflict. They moved to her sister's house in the Al- Nuseirat area of central Gaza. She said: ""Forty-two of my close family - including my parents, my brothers and sisters, their children and grandchildren - all of them when they were peacefully asleep, suddenly gone. "" Although she is grieving the loss of many of her family, Mrs Attaallah Elian said she is now focused on bringing her surviving relatives to the UK, because she is a resident here. She said she has contacted a lawyer and was ""trying to put in a request to the British government but they don't have foreign passports so they can't get out"". Speaking to the BBC from Egypt, Mrs Attaallah Elian added that if there was ever peace in the future, she wanted to say goodbye to her family properly.

1756,2023-12-06 10:31:04+00:00,/news/business-67628380,"There is no evidence some investors profited from knowledge of Hamas's attack on Israel before it took place on 7 October, the Israel Securities Authority (ISA) has said. One academic study had suggested investors betting against the Israeli economy made large sums. It said it found significant short-selling in the run-up to the attacks. But the report has since been called ""inaccurate"" and ""irresponsible"" by the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE). The ISA said it was dropping its investigation into the matter. Short-selling is when investors try to make money on shares, bonds or other financial instruments that they think will fall in price.  They arrange to sell shares they do not yet own at the current price, hoping to buy them later at a cheaper price before the shares change hands, so they can then bank the difference. ""Days before the attack, traders appeared to anticipate the events to come,"" researchers Robert Jackson Jr from New York University and Joshua Mitts of Columbia University had stated on Tuesday. The researchers said they had identified a dramatic increase in investors seeking to sell shares in Israeli companies on the TASE. But the stock exchange said the claims made in the academic paper since were inaccurate, labelling them ""irresponsible"".  TASE said the authors of the report had miscalculated the sums, showing the value of the share prices in agorot, similar to pennies, instead of Israeli shekels.  ""Therefore they calculate a profit of NIS 3.2bn (£680m) when in practice the profit was only NIS 32m (£6.8m),"" TASE's head of trade Yaniv Pagot told the publication Globes.  He also said claims of a sudden spike in trading before the attack were ""divorced from reality"". The researchers have corrected the currency mistake in their report, but Mr Mitts on Tuesday said that he stood by the ""highly unusual"" exchange traded fund (ETF) and short-dated options activity also identified by the researchers. Correction 7 December: This article updates a previous one that included incorrect currency information provided in the report by Robert Jackson Jr from New York University and Joshua Mitts of Columbia University.

1758,2023-12-03 20:45:25+00:00,/news/world-middle-east-67607243,"Israeli ground forces are pushing into southern Gaza, after three days of heavy bombardment.  Initial reports from Israeli army radio effectively confirmed Israel has launched a ground operation to the north of Khan Younis. The BBC has also verified images of an Israeli tank operating near the city.  The head of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) later told troops the IDF was also fighting ""strongly and thoroughly"" in south Gaza. Lt General Herzi Halevi was speaking to reservists from the Gaza division about military objectives and the IDF's killing of Hamas commanders. He told the soldiers: ""We fought strongly and thoroughly in the northern Gaza Strip, and we are also doing it now in the southern Gaza Strip"".  An IDF spokesman later confirmed Israel ""continues to expand the ground incursion"" across all of Gaza, including troops ""conducting face to face battles with terrorists"". Since a week-long ceasefire ended on Friday, Israel has resumed a large-scale bombing campaign on Gaza, which residents of Khan Younis have described as the heaviest wave of attacks so far.  The seven-day truce saw Hamas release 110 hostages being held in Gaza in return for 240 Palestinians being released from Israeli prisons. On Sunday morning, the Israeli army issued evacuation orders for several districts of Khan Younis, urging people to leave immediately. Israeli authorities believe members of the Hamas leadership are hiding in the city, where hundreds of thousands of people have been sheltering after fleeing fighting in the north in the early stages of the war. A UN official has described a ""degree of panic"" he has not seen before in a Gaza hospital, after the Israeli military shifted the focus of its offensive to the south. James Elder, from the children's agency Unicef, described Nasser Medical Hospital in Khan Younis as a ""warzone"". An adviser to Israel's prime minister said Israel is making ""maximum effort"" to avoid killing civilians. Mr Elder told the BBC he could hear constant large explosions close to the Nasser hospital and children were arriving with head injuries, terrible burns, and shrapnel from recent blasts. ""It's a hospital I've gone to regularly and the children know me now, the families know me now. Those same people are grabbing my hand, or grabbing my shirt saying 'please take us somewhere safe. Where is safe?'"" ""They are unfortunately asking a question to which the only answer is there is nowhere safe. And that includes for them, as they know, that hospital,"" he said. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 500 people have been killed since the bombing resumed.  More than 15,500 people have been killed in the strip since the war began, the ministry also said.  Mohammed Ghalayini, a British-Palestinian who has stayed in Gaza, said the situation in the city was ""beyond catastrophic"". ""People have been, for 50 days or more, withstanding brutal Israeli onslaught and are very low on all resources - food, water, power and the sanitation and the waste services,"" he told the BBC by phone, before the connection cut off. The air pollution expert, who normally lives in Manchester, arrived in Gaza for a three-month visit to see his mother shortly before the 7 October attacks. Israel began its retaliatory bombing of Gaza following Hamas's attacks on southern Israel on 7 October, which saw around 1,200 people killed and 240 taken hostage. Rockets have also been regularly fired at Israel from Gaza since fighting resumed on Friday. A 22-year-old man in the city of Holon, near Tel Aviv, was treated for minor shrapnel injuries on Saturday.  Hundreds of thousands of people have already fled the fighting to take shelter in Khan Younis, after Israel told them to leave the north of the strip. The latest UN update says around 1.8 million people are internally displaced in Gaza. Speaking to the BBC, the UN's High Commissioner for Refugees chief, Filippo Grandi, said Palestinians in the Gaza Strip are being ""pushed more and more towards a narrow corner of what is already a very narrow territory"".  The IDF has begun posting maps of areas set to be attacked online. It says these maps, along with other measures like phone calls and leaflets being dropped on Gaza by plane, will warn people to evacuate. Speaking to the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's senior adviser Mark Regev said civilians are not targets and protecting them is made more difficult by Hamas ""embedding its military terror machine"" in civilian neighbourhoods. He says the IDF are trying to be ""as surgical as we can in a very difficult combat situation"", and has given advance warning of attacks. Separately, the IDF say they have destroyed 500 ""terror tunnel"" shafts used by Hamas in Gaza, out of the 800 they say have been found so far. It also said around 10,000 air strikes on ""terror targets"" have been carried out by the air force ""under the guidance of IDF soldiers on the ground"" since the war began.

1759,2023-12-06 06:00:02+00:00,/news/world-middle-east-67617920,"A few nights ago, the school in Khirbet Zanuta, a small Palestinian village in the hills south of Hebron, was destroyed along with most of the houses, by a bulldozer.  Its tracks lay fresh and undisturbed in the sand when we arrived. The village was empty as its population of about 200 Palestinians left around a month ago, after sustained pressure and threats from armed and aggressive Jewish settlers who live in nearby outposts that are illegal under both Israeli and international law.  A twisted metal sign lies in the rubble of the school in Khirbet Zanuta. In bold black letters it reads ""Humanitarian Support to Palestinians at risk of forcible transfer in the West Bank"". The sign records the donors who gave money to the project. The European Union was the lead donor and, among a panel of European development agencies, is also the coat of arms of the British royal family over the words British Consulate-General Jerusalem.  Nadav Weiman came with the BBC to the village. He is a former Israeli special forces soldier who is now an activist with Breaking the Silence, a group of former combatants who campaign against Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories. Nadav believes that Jewish settlers, the most militant of whom are known by name to local Palestinians, were once again flouting the law with the police and army.  ""They're demolishing Palestinian villages, beating up Palestinian farmers, stealing their olives, trying to open a third front, an eastern front against the Palestinians in the West Bank. Why? Because they want the land without Palestinians. "" Two Israeli soldiers came to investigate what we were doing. One of them told an Israeli member of the BBC team that he was a traitor for visiting Palestinians. They filmed us but took much less interest in what had happened in Khirbet Zanuta, a few miles down the road.  When I asked the police if they were investigating the flattening of the school and the village, they emailed back that they were waiting for a complaint. In fact, lawyers for Zanuta's Palestinians had petitioned Israel's Supreme Court.  In three days of travelling through the occupied West Bank, Palestinians have said consistently that since the war in Gaza started on 7 October, Jewish settlers are better armed and much more aggressive.  Violent attacks, including fatal shootings of Palestinians by armed Jewish settlers in the West Bank have risen sharply. So many attacks are happening that Israel's closest allies, including the United States and the United Kingdom, have condemned violence by extremist settlers and demanded that those guilty of crimes should be prosecuted.  In practice, settlers rarely end up in court and if they do, they can usually expect light sentences.  The settlers are armed and supported by powerful allies in the Israeli government, led by Itamar Ben Gvir, the minister for national security and Bezalel Smotrich, the finance minister who also has security responsibilities in the West Bank.  Controversially, Mr Smotrich just found more than $100 million for the settlers. Apparently referring to opinion polls saying Palestinians were supporting Hamas, he told The Times of Israel newspaper that ""there are two million Nazis in Judea and Samaria, who hate us exactly as do the Nazis of Hamas-ISIS in Gaza"". Judea and Samaria is a biblical term for the West Bank. The reality of settler attacks was captured in a video taken by Muntassar Mhilat, a young Palestinian man from a family of Bedouins who live in the Judean desert not far from Jericho.  Their family home was invaded by about 20 violent, armed Jewish men. Muntassar filmed them yelling and pointing weapons.  ""He was shooting at my uncle, so I ran down there and confronted him. We were pushing each other and screaming, head-to-head. And I was filming him. Then, around 20 settlers came. "" The video shows a settler loading his M-16 assault rifle and pointing it at the family. One of the women there, Umm Omar, carrying a month old baby, thought they were about to die.  ""They attacked our house, stole our sheep, threatened my kids with guns and threatened me. Then they hit me and my husband's sister. I thought they were going to slaughter us. "" No-one was killed. The settlers accused them, falsely the family said, of stealing their goats. The man who pointed a loaded weapon was wearing a police jacket.  A common complaint is that settlers have been drafted into the security forces as reservists since 7 October and are abusing the power and position that come with the uniform and automatic weapons issued by the state. The family recognised some of the attackers, as they came from an illegal outpost about a mile away. They know there will be a next time and feel sick with worry.  The harassment of Palestinians is also economic and psychological.  South of Hebron Palestinian farmers are ploughing with the donkey because local Jewish settlers have threatened to steal or break their tractor if they use it.   Almost at the other end of the West Bank, in a village outside Nablus called Burin, Ahmed Tirawi, a farmer looked across the valley at his olive trees, starting to rot because he has been forbidden by the local settlers to pick them.  ""If I go up there on the hillside to harvest my olives, it's taking my life in my hands. The settlers make attacks on the farmers here - one bullet and they will kill me. "" The olive season is always a time of tension, but this time he said it has been ""horrible"".  ""My feelings are more than anger. I feel humiliated by all of this. I am powerless to protect myself from just one settler. It's such a humiliation to be so alone and unable to protect yourself. The only solution is international law, two states and to protect people from the Israeli occupation. "" I went to talk to Yehuda Simon, a prominent settler leader at his own outpost, Havat Gilad, near Nablus. He is a lawyer who has represented settlers accused of attacking Palestinians, and he nodded approvingly when I said Palestinian farmers in the area near where he lived were being stopped from harvesting their olives.  ""The army came to the conclusion that the Palestinians coming to harvest olives are gathering information in order to carry out an attack like on 7 October. "" He dismissed the repeated, documented reports of settlers attacking Palestinians.  ""I don't hear about people who kill Palestinians. Okay. If the Palestinian just sits on his balcony and the settlers come and kill him, it's never happened. Okay. And I don't believe that the British and United States and all countries in the world, they are a friend of Israel… even Joe Biden is against Jewish people. He doesn't like Jewish people. "" As for the Arabs: ""They could stay here with us, but not try to kill us in the beginning. "" For more than a century, Arabs and Jews have been fighting over this small piece of land. The war in Gaza hasn't just increased violence in the West Bank. The way it ends, when it ends, will affect whether the next generation can escape this endless conflict.  The sight of families forced out of their homes raises memories of 1948 for Palestinians. By the time Israel won the battle for its independence, more than 700,000 Palestinians had either fled or been expelled from their homes at gunpoint. The new state took their property and never allowed them to go home. Palestinians call the events of 1948 the ""Nakba"" or catastrophe.  Settler violence and the loss of homes confirm, for Palestinians, their worst fears, that powerful forces in Israel's government and the settler movement want them out and are using the huge crisis surrounding the war in Gaza to make it happen.",Israeli settler violence brings destruction and fear to West Bank,Israeli settler violence brings destruction and fear to West Bank as war rages,"israel,palestinian_territories,israel_and_the_palestinians,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-67617920,articles/article_1759.txt,results/article_1759.txt.json

It comes during an operation against militants in the city, which has so far left 11 Palestinians dead, the Palestinian health ministry says. The IDF said the soldiers ""will be disciplined accordingly"". It said it would also act in similar cases which have been filmed in Gaza. The clips, which are circulating on social media, show scenes of the mosque. In one recording, a song about banishing darkness, associated with the current Jewish festival of Hanukkah, is heard sung in Hebrew through a loudspeaker in a minaret. The person filming laughs and joins in with the song. Other clips show soldiers inside a mosque reciting a Jewish prayer down a microphone. The Palestinian foreign ministry condemned what it called ""a mockery of [the mosque's] sanctity"". In a statement on Thursday, the IDF said the soldiers ""acted against IDF codes of conduct within a religious establishment"". The statement said those responsible ""were immediately removed from operational activity"". It added: ""The behaviour of the soldiers in the videos is serious and stands in complete opposition to the values ​​of the IDF. "" The incidents in Jenin are not the first time Israeli soldiers have been upbraided for bad behaviour filmed and posted on social media recently. Since Israeli forces have been fighting the war in Gaza from the end of October, videos have emerged including showing a soldier smashing up a toy shop, while the person filming laughs; soldiers setting fire to goods in the back of a lorry; and another rummaging through women's clothes in what appears to be a private residence. On Sunday, IDF spokesman Rear Adm Daniel Hagari condemned the soldiers' behaviour. ""IDF forces operate according to the values and spirit of the IDF,"" he said. ""Soldiers on the battlefield are required to act professionally and ethically, and we will not compromise on this. In any event. . .

People in eastern areas of the city have been told by the Israeli military to evacuate further to the south.  Israel believes some Hamas leaders are in the city, where many civilians are sheltering after fleeing the north. Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says at least 193 people have been killed in the latest wave of Israeli attacks. On Friday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) resumed its offensive against Hamas in Gaza, launched in response to the 7 October attacks in Israel which killed around 1,200 people. The Hamas-run health ministry says the number of people killed in Gaza has now exceeded 15,200 people. Israel's bombardment of Gaza resumed after a temporary ceasefire ended on Friday. The IDF said it had hit more than 400 Hamas ""terror targets"" on the first day of the renewed operation.  Rockets have also been regularly fired at Israel from Gaza since fighting resumed, including a barrage aimed at Tel Aviv and the surrounding area of central Israel on Saturday evening. Following this attack, Israel's ambulance service said it treated a 22-year-old man for ""minor shrapnel injuries"" to the head in Holon - a city just south of Tel Aviv. At a briefing on Saturday evening, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged to continue with the Israeli military operation until ""we achieve all the goals"" in eliminating Hamas and securing the release of the hostages. He acknowledged that ""a tough war is ahead of us"".  Khan Younis and the city of Rafah, on the border with Egypt, were some of the places hit with heavy air strikes, with the next phase of the offensive likely to focus on southern Gaza.  Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have sought shelter in the area, after being told to flee the north of the territory, which was Israel's main target in the early stages of the war. The IDF's Arabic-language spokesman posted maps on social media indicating which areas civilians should leave, directing people in areas east of Khan Younis to evacuate further south to shelters in Rafah, an indication that a ground offensive could be imminent. Hospitals, operating with limited resources after weeks of fighting, were overwhelmed with casualties, and at the Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, some patients were treated on the floor. ""A night of horror,"" Samira, a mother of four, told the Reuters news agency. ""It was one of the worst nights we spent in Khan Younis in the past six weeks since we arrived here. . . We are so afraid they will enter Khan Younis. "" Unicef spokesman James Elder, who was in Khan Younis on Saturday, told the BBC that hospitals were already ""saturated"" with casualties before the strikes resumed.  ""There is literally blood in the corridors, there are mothers yet again holding babies who look like they've been killed"", he said. The Palestinian Red Crescent charity confirmed 100 lorries with aid were allowed to enter Gaza from Egypt on Saturday. On Friday, no humanitarian supplies were delivered to the territory.  Talks to reach a deal for another temporary ceasefire and to secure the release of the people kidnapped on 7 October who remain in Gaza collapsed on Saturday.  A Palestinian official familiar with the talks told the BBC that the negotiations were completely stalled, with no contacts or attempts to reach a fresh truce. On Saturday, Israel announced it was pulling its negotiators from the Mossad intelligence service out of talks in Qatar, which has been acting as a mediator, following an ""impasse in the negotiations"". Saleh al-Arouri, deputy head of Hamas's political bureau, told Al Jazeera on Saturday that ""there are no negotiations now"" and there would be no more prisoners exchanged with Israel until the war is over. US Vice President Kamala Harris, in a meeting with the president of Egypt, said ""under no circumstances [would] the United States permit the forced relocation of Palestinians from Gaza or the West Bank, the besiegement of Gaza, or the redrawing of the borders of Gaza"". She also reiterated the US position that Israel had the right to defend itself. During their meeting in Dubai on the sidelines of the UN's COP28 climate conference, she told Abdul Fattah al-Sisi that peace efforts could only succeed if ""pursued in the context of a clear political horizon for the Palestinian people towards a state of their own led by a revitalized Palestinian Authority"". At Saturday's briefing, Mr Netanyahu praised the release of 110 Israeli hostages - women and children - as well as some foreigners. ""Welcome back from hell,"" Mr Netanyahu said. The hostages were released in exchange for the freeing of 240 Palestinian prisoners - women and teenagers.

1762,2023-12-12 06:00:34+00:00,/news/world-middle-east-67679634,"Danielle Waldman danced the last dance of her young life some time before dawn on 7 October. Soon afterwards she and her friends had to run for their lives, but they never made it home.  There is a record of her final moments - a brief video, recorded on a phone. It gives only a hint of the horrors to come. The 24-year-old sits in the back seat of a car with two friends - strands of her long curly hair escaping from her grey hoodie. All three are casually dressed. There are fleeting smiles and overlapping voices, and a glimpse of blue wrist bands from the Supernova trance music festival they have just attended. They are trying to remain calm, but they are being hunted. Danielle's boyfriend Noam Shai is in front, behind the wheel.  ""Want me to drive very, very fast?"" he asks. ""I know how to do that. ""  ""Correct,"" replies a female passenger. A bearded young man sitting beside Danielle tries to provide reassurance. ""We will be all right,"" he says. ""Everything is ok, right?"" Next, from the front, an urgent demand - ""left, or right?"" Then the video ends.   Minutes later Hamas gunmen riddled the car with bullets. Noam, Danielle, and their friends in the back seat were killed - as were nearly 360 other Israelis who went to dance at the festival in the Negev desert near the Gaza border.  The front seat passenger was taken hostage. When the sun set on that day, 1,200 Israelis had been slaughtered - either at the festival or in their homes in kibbutzim close to the border. It was the worst loss of Jewish life in a single day since the Holocaust. The vast majority were civilians. Since then, Israel has gone to war in Gaza ""to eradicate Hamas"", and Palestinians in turn have been slaughtered.  Almost 18,000 people have been killed at last count - according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza - 7,300 of them children.  In Gaza now, as in Israel after 7 October, parents are burying their children. And for every parent, Palestinian or Israeli, the loss is incomparable. We meet Danielle's father Eyal in his art-filled office, high above Tel Aviv. He has long been a tech giant - who founded the Israeli chip maker Mellanox Technologies, and sold it for $6.8bn in 2019.  But now he is simply a father, raw with grief, robbed of his youngest daughter.  ""She was an amazing girl,"" he says in a voice laden with love and grief. ""She loved to dance. She loved animals. She loved people. She had many, many friends. She loved to snowboard, to scuba dive, to go on a motorcycle with Noam. "" When he got word that Danielle was missing, he raced back from a trip to Indonesia - getting permission to land in Israel, even though the airspace was closed. Three hours later he went looking for her, tracking her apple watch. It was a journey into a battlefield.  ""We were close to an engagement with seven terrorists, creatures, call them what you want,"" he says. ""They had killed three or four soldiers. After that we took three officers in a jeep and went down south. ""   He found the bullet-riddled car, but there was no sign of Danielle. ""There was a lot of blood inside the car,"" he says. ""I was hoping she wasn't in the car, or that she was wounded but was able to escape, or was taken hostage. ""  Two days later her body was found. ""Everything she touched was with a smile. She never did anything wrong to anyone,"" he says, choking back tears. ""She just loved doing good things. And they [Hamas] just murdered her for no reason. "" Despite the brutal killing of his youngest daughter, Eyal Waldman still believes that the Palestinians should have a state - and soon.  ""We need to change leadership on both sides. And then I hope in two to four years we'll be able to do peace and build two states for the two people and be able to live together next to each other,"" he says.

And we will take care of that,"" he says firmly.  ""We know exactly who came, who raped, who butchered.  We have videos, we have their cell phone numbers. We know who they are. We can eliminate them.

1763,2023-12-07 16:24:34.549000+00:00,/news/articles/c84vdnjv2dvo,"Dr Elliot Sorene and his Israeli-born wife Merav are lighting candles at their north London home, bringing in the Jewish festival of Chanukah, having experienced what they call “the worst two months of their lives”. For Dr Sorene, a consultant orthopaedic surgeon, the 7 October Hamas attacks were particularly personal as his son Ariel was caught up in the Supernova massacre, where 365 attendees were killed, hundreds wounded and 40 kidnapped at a rave. Ariel - who has dual British-Israeli citizenship - heard rockets while at the trance party in southern Israel - before seeing militants shoot indiscriminately at the partygoers. Dr Sorene said: “It was horrific. My son nearly died. He was shot at and ran to safety. Some of his friends didn’t make it. I’m so thankful he’s alive. ” As is the case with many in the capital - which has the UK's largest Jewish community - the Sorenes have numerous connections with those affected directly by the latest wave of violence. Dr Sorene, who spent years living and working in Israel including as a hospital surgeon, says he has lost friends who were killed by Hamas. “These last two months have been the worst two months of our lives; we’ve been racked with worry about what’s going on in Israel and we’ve also seen a horrendous uptick in London of antisemitic incidents, where Jews don’t currently feel safe. ” The Sorenes have three daughters who go to a London Jewish school. Since 7 October, they have become increasingly worried about a spike in antisemitism in London including cases of harassment, violence and schools being targeted, along with instances of antisemitism associated with the weekly pro-Palestinian marches in the capital. “We don't know what’s going to be. It all feels very unsafe. I'm worried about my daughters who speak Hebrew at home, so I ask them not to speak Hebrew outside,"" says Merav Sorene, who is an aesthetic nurse. “I wear my Magen David (Star of David) under my shirt, and I'm very conscious about that. And it's suddenly things have been very abnormal living in London. ” The Metropolitan Police said it had scaled up its visible presence since the Gaza war began, amid a significant increase in Islamophobia and antisemitism. In the period between the Hamas attack and 27 October, the Community Security Trust, a British charity, said it had recorded 805 antisemitic acts, the highest number in a three-week period since it began documenting episodes of this kind in 1984.  Dr Sorene says he has personally experienced abuse since 7 October. “I’ve been called a Christ killer, a baby killer. I've been told people [are] proudly supporting Hamas, supporting their terror attack, supporting what happened on the 7th of October. “I was born in this country, have lived here all my life; my father fought in the Second World War for the British army. We have always contributed to British society. Now we feel hatred and violence towards us. ”",Jewish Londoners suffer 'worst two months',Jewish Londoners suffer 'worst two months',"israel,israel-gaza_war,hamas,gaza",http://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c84vdnjv2dvo,articles/article_1763.txt,results/article_1763.txt.json
1765,2023-12-07 13:41:16+00:00,/news/world-africa-67622511,"Kenya is sending 1,500 farm workers to Israel, the labour ministry has said. The announcement comes nearly two weeks after Malawi sent 221 young people to work on Israeli farms, triggering a backlash against the government there. The casual workers will be deployed on three-year renewable contracts, ""with a guaranteed net [monthly] income"" of $1,500 (£1,195), Kenya said. Israel has turned to Africa to fill a severe labour gap on its farms, after a mass exit of foreign workers. More than 10,000 migrant farm workers - mostly Thailand nationals - have left Israel since the start of the war with Hamas in early October. Israel has also barred Palestinian workers, who made up nearly 20% of the agricultural labour force prior to the war. Israel's ambassador in Kenya, Michael Lotem, told the BBC that Israel was planning to recruit farm workers from Uganda as well, while recruitment in Tanzania had already started.   ""We are looking to East Africa to fill the labour gap as we have had student internships programmes in place for many years with these countries and it has been a good experience,"" Mr Lotem said. He added that the labour shortage had been caused by the fact that an estimated 360,000 Israeli reservists have been called up for military service since the war started.  He did not cite work restrictions on Palestinians or the departure of foreign nationals as the reasons for the shortage. Israel's agriculture ministry told CNN last week that the country needed 30-40,000 farm workers. The announcement has sparked mixed reactions in Kenya, with some concerned about the workers' safety. At least 32 Thai farm workers were killed and several others taken hostage when Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October. Tanzanian student Clemence Felix Mtenga - who was in Israel as an agriculture intern - was also killed in the attack, while another Tanzanian student, Joshua Loitu Mollel, is still missing.  Critics have also questioned the conditions the workers will face in Israel. In 2018, a BBC investigation found that many migrant farm workers in Israel were subject to unsafe working practices and squalid, unsanitary living conditions. Some were overworked, others underpaid, and there were dozens of unexplained deaths. Rights groups like Human Rights Watch have also previously raised the alarm over Israel's treatment of foreign farm labourers. At the time Israel denied the accusations and has since said that foreign workers enjoyed the same employment rights as Israeli citizens. Mr Lotem said extra measures have since been put in place to ensure foreign workers are treated fairly and that any foreign worker can now file a complaint which will be quickly tracked. Some Kenyans have supported the deal, saying it provides badly needed jobs at a time when Kenya is battling an unemployment crisis and the rising cost of living. Kenya has an unemployment rate of 5.5%, according to the World Bank. Malawi's government has also announced that it will send 5,000 more young people to work on Israeli farms, rejecting calls to drop the plan. ""People are going out of desperation,"" said William Kambwandira, the executive director at the Centre for Social Accountability and Transparency, a workers' rights watchdog based in the capital Lilongwe. ""Given that the war is happening, we are concerned about the welfare of these young men and women,"" he added. However, Mr Lotem told the BBC that the farm workers would not be placed in areas close to the conflict, and they would have the same protection as Israelis. The promise of a secure job and higher salary has pushed safety worries aside for many of the Malawian workers going to Israel. Andrew Chunga, 27, was part of the first group of 221 Malawians who took up jobs in Israel last month.  He is currently living in a two-bedroom house with two other Malawians on a farm in Gefen in central Israel, and has spent the first week removing weeds.  ""This is all about money. I am here for greener pastures. ""When I go home, I will be a millionaire,"" Mr Chunga said laughing.  Jamison Kupatamoyo, 27, is another Malawian who has been working in Israel since last month.  He said he was thrilled to get the job as it will help him gain agriculture training and send a good wage back to his family.  ""I'll be in Israel for five years but will go back to Malawi every year for a holiday,"" Mr Kupatamoyo told the BBC.  ""There is unemployment in Malawi, and the salaries are low [there], compared to here in Israel,"" he added. Asked if he was worried for his personal safety, Mr Kupatamoyo replied: ""I was already aware about the conflict in Israel, but there is a lot of fake news on social media.  ""It is only small parts of Israel that are affected - not the whole country. ""  Mr Kupatamoyo said his employment agency had talked to him about the conflict. ""They explained everything about the war and assured us that where we are going is a safe place and we have witnessed that so far. "" A 31-year-old man in Lilongwe told the BBC he would be travelling to Israel soon to take up a job after being unemployed for four years.  ""My email address has more than 300 sent messages applying for jobs. I have diploma and a bachelor's degree,"" said Alex, who asked for his surname to be withheld.  He does have some safety concerns.  ""We have been assured that the conflict has nothing to do with us. They told us about security measures like missiles detectors and safe houses.

1766,2023-12-08 06:15:28+00:00,/news/uk-england-london-67648377,"A couple who got trapped in the West Bank as the Israel-Gaza conflict broke out say they are traumatised and afraid for their relatives who remain there. Palestinians Imad Alqasim and Zeina Ramadan, who live in London, said it took days to leave with their child. The husband and wife say they have struggled to eat and sleep since returning to the capital. Ms Ramadan also said she was ""living in a nightmare"" and felt ""guilt for being able to leave"". Mr Alqasim and Ms Ramadan were visiting extended family in Nablus and then travelled to Ramallah in the central west Bank. The couple were looking forward to visiting Bethlehem and Jerusalem but all this changed when news reached them that Hamas had launched an attack on Israel on 7 October. Mr Alqasim said ""people started being a bit terrified"" and taxi drivers advised them not to travel because ""it was not safe"", so they cancelled their trip to Bethlehem and remained in Ramallah hoping things would improve. Instead the situation became worse. ""I didn't leave the home at all and someone came and brought food to the place we were in because we couldn't actually move. "" Mr Alqasim and Ms Ramadan decided to cancel their other trips and ""leave as quick as possible"" once the border reopened. However, the couple realised Ms Ramadan could not return to London initially as she is a Palestinian citizen unlike Mr Alqasim, who has British citizenship. He said it was ""a hard decision"" to leave his wife and child behind, something he later regretted. ""I thought if I was outside I could be a little bit more helpful in trying to get her out,"" said Imad. Ms Ramadan said although she grew up in the area and was familiar with it, having her baby daughter with her made her feel more vulnerable. ""No-one knew if the road was safe, [my husband] was asking the driver if that road was safe and he was saying 'we don't know - we don't know if the road is open, we don't know if the road is safe',"" she said. Mr Alqasim managed to cross the border to Amman in Jordan, while Ms Ramadan returned to Nablus, which she said was under siege and officially announced as a closed area by the Israeli army. When she and their daughter finally made it to Amman two days later they flew back to the UK, arriving in London on 13 October but their ordeal is still continuing as they process being apart from their relatives in the West Bank. ""It was the hardest thing I've ever been through, Ms Ramadan said, adding: ""We weren't eating properly, we weren't sleeping properly. "" ""Part of my brain was trying to function - what happened, how we were separated for a while as a family, how I made a decision to leave. ""I felt guilty for being able to leave. . . I still feel this guilt. "" She continued: ""Seeing people in the streets; of course they're living their normal lives but something shifted in my head.  ""It makes you feel unreal, it makes you feel like, 'I'm living in a nightmare, this is not real'. Even though almost every generation of her family have lived through periods of conflict and the trio are physically safe in London, Zeina said she doesn't ""feel safe"". ""When you start your day you need some time to try to understand that you're not there and there's nothing you can do about it except to move on with your life. "" ""There is a collective grief, but we don't even have time to grieve. It doesn't stop,"" she explained. ""There are some moments where you break down with even minor things. There's a lot of talk about post-traumatic [stress] but there is no post, there is no post. . . because that has been my whole life,"" she said through tears. ""I just want things to be over and then we can think about grief,"" Ms Ramadan said. ""I need to be strong for [my daughter]. "" Additional reporting by Alice Bhandhukravi.

1768,2023-12-09 06:51:06+00:00,/news/world-europe-67657837,"Emmanuel Macron has been accused of betraying the French Republic after he took part in a Jewish ceremony inside his official residence, the Elysée Palace. In a country where the separation of religion is itself a religion, the lighting of a Hanukkah candle inside the historic Salle des Fêtes on Thursday was immediately denounced by politicians of both right and left. The president had invited France's Chief Rabbi Haïm Korsia to light the first of eight candles on a Hanukkiah, or candelabra, marking the start of the Jewish festival of lights. The occasion was the award to President Macron of a prize for his efforts against antisemitism.  But when video of the ceremony appeared shortly afterwards on social media, there was furore. For French opinion-formers of all stripes, the president had committed an enormous faux-pas by allowing religion into the secular hallows of the presidency. ""As far as I know this is the first time this has ever happened. It is a breach of secularism,"" said David Lisnard, a prominent right-wing opposition figure who is also mayor of Cannes. ""The Elysée is not a place of religion. You cannot compromise with secularism,"" said the Socialist president of the Occitania region, Carole Delga. ""Will Macron now do the same for other religions? Some yes, some no? It's a dangerous spiral,"" said Alexis Corbière of the far-left France Unbowed. Even some French Jews were perplexed. ""This is something that shouldn't be allowed to happen again,"" said Yonathan Arfi who heads the Representative Council of French Jewish Institutions (Crif). ""French Jews have always considered secularism as a law of protection and of freedom. Anything that weakens secularism weakens Jews,"" he said.  The idea of ""secularism"" was put into a French law of 1905, after years of struggle between the state and the Roman Catholic Church. It enshrined freedom of belief, but ended state involvement in the Church and removed all signs of religion from public buildings. The law has since come to be regarded as a cornerstone of modern France, ensuring strict neutrality between Christianity, Islam and Judaism, and guaranteeing that citizens are seen as individuals-in-a-state and not as members-in-a-community.  For Emmanuel Macron to have breached a century-old Republican doctrine will be seen by critics as confirmation of his overweening self-belief and ""Jupiterian"" entitlement. Speaking on Friday as he viewed renovation work at Notre-Dame cathedral, the president said he had no regrets, and that his invitation to the chief rabbi had been made ""in the spirit of the Republic and of concord"". ""If the president had actually carried out a religious act, or taken part in a ceremony, that would indeed have been a breach of secularism. But that is not what happened,"" he said. The gesture comes at the end of a long political sequence over Gaza in which President Macron has been under attack for improvising policy on the hoof. Critics say he has failed to present a consistent line on the war, instead zigzagging from overclose proximity to the Israeli side at one moment, to intense courting of Arab opinion at the next: always with the aim of appeasing the large Jewish and Muslim populations in France. Shortly after 7 October, Mr Macron visited Israel and proposed an international coalition against Hamas, much like the one that defeated so-called Islamic State (IS).  Accused of abandoning France's traditional backing for Palestinians, he then organised an international aid conference on Gaza to which Israel was not invited.  He then further angered some Jews by refusing to attend a march against antisemitism, and in a BBC interview he spoke of ""babies"" being bombed by the Israeli air force. Some have detected in this latest gesture at the Elysée a new, single-handed touch to the tiller of state. In France's foreign ministry, which has been largely sidelined by President Macron, off-the-record interviews make clear the frustration among professional diplomats. ""One day Macron is on the verge of announcing that he's going to help the Israeli army wipe out Gaza. Two weeks later he's on the BBC calling Israel a baby-killer,"" one former diplomat told Libération newspaper. ""OK, we know it is all about internal politics. But here, he's alienating first the Muslims, then the Jews.

As a British-Palestinian dual national, Mohammed Ghalayini could have escaped early after war broke out in October. ""This apartment block - it's been my family's home since the 1930s and my sister was born there. To leave it forcibly under threat of death is a horrible, horrible feeling,"" he said. He reached Egypt via Rafah on Sunday. As he travelled to Cairo, he said: ""I'm so relieved but also very sad to be leaving Gaza, to be leaving my friends, my family members behind - knowing they're at risk of death, injury, loss of their properties, loss of their livelihoods, loss of their land. ""Without a ceasefire, they're at risk of all that - we need a ceasefire now. "" On Friday, the US blocked a resolution at the UN Security Council calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. The UK abstained while the remaining 13 on the 15-member group voted in favour. Mr Ghalayini said: ""I'm so grateful to the British consular staff who have done a great job in facilitating in getting me and many others out. "" The 44-year-old was visiting relatives when Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, killing 1,200 people and taking about 240 hostages. The air pollution scientist remained with his family as the death toll in Gaza climbed to more than 18,000.   He previously told BBC North West Tonight about struggles to get enough food and sleep, saying ""We're not eating enough and we're kind of running around the streets trying to get stuff and wondering where the next bomb will fall. "" ""Leaving could mean death and injury and staying could mean death and injury, so it's basically being between a rock and a hard place. "" He described the seven-day truce in November as comparatively ""idyllic"" when he cycled to a nearby beach, picked olives, visited friends and collected a large water container for his family. Speaking on Sunday before he left Gaza, he said: ""It's so hard to leave people behind like this.

The personal finance expert, who received a CBE last year for services to broadcasting and consumer rights, said being seen as a trusted voice was ""an incredible compliment"".  But speaking about that pressure and the toll it had taken on his mental health, Mr Lewis said he had ""dark days"". ""One of the greatest difficulties is you think, 'Have I got it right?

The financial journalist, who also hosts the ""The Martin Lewis Podcast"" on BBC Radio 5 Live, opened up about the pressure he felt to speak publicly about the war in Gaza.  Mr Lewis, who is Jewish, said calls for him to do so were ""bordering anti-Semitic"". ""I have never been asked about political situations in China, or Saudi Arabia, or South America,"" he explained.  ""I'm British. I'm a British Jew. My parents were born in Britain.

It has released images of three men it wants to speak to about the graffiti. In a now-deleted post online, the Labour MP advised those responsible to ""next time, just try emailing"". It is the second appeal the force has made about the graffiti, having previously released an image of another man wanted in connection with the attack. Ms Clark's post on X, formerly Twitter, had also included a censored image of the vandalism, which appeared to contain the words ""free Palestine"". The graffiti was painted on the office five days after the MPs voted against a proposal to call for a full ceasefire between Israel and the Hamas-run government in Gaza. Ms Clark, who was shadow minister for health at the time, abstained on the vote, in line with instructions her party gave to its front bench shadow ministers. A number of MPs received backlash after the vote, including a protest by hundreds of people outside Sir Keir Starmer's north London constituency office.

The mayor has written to Home Secretary James Cleverley to call for an increase in the National and International Capital City (NICC) grant. NICC is a mechanism provided to the Met to support the additional costs of policing a capital city – including protests, sporting events and diplomatic protection. The Home Office said the force will receive up to £102.3m more in 2023/24 than the previous year. In his letter, Mr Khan wrote: “The Home Office’s independent expert review in 2015 identified a £159m annual gap in funding (at 2015 prices) and recent estimates from the [Metropolitan Police Service] suggest it could now be £240m. ”The mayor highlighted the policing of protests and vigils connected to the Israel-Gaza war since October as a strain on police resources. He said 28,000 shifts have been completed in connection with the events. “These additional costs result in reduced resource available for frontline and neighbourhood teams,” he said. Officer welfare is also taking a hit, the mayor wrote, with 4,000 rest days being cancelled. “Many officers have worked every weekend since 7 October and sickness rates are rising, a trend which is likely to continue,” he added. Mr Khan singled out Just Stop Oil protests as a particular repeated issue for police. Figures released by the Met this week show 657 arrests were made over the last five weeks at the climate protests, at a cost of £3.5m. A Met spokesperson said it also resulted in “10,500 officer shifts being taken away from communities”. “The return of a fully funded NICC would not only benefit our officers but all those who live, work or visit London,” Mr Khan said.

French company CMA CGM took a similar step a day after Danish shipping giant Maersk and German transport company Hapag-Lloyd suspended Red Sea journeys. The decision comes after attacks by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. They say they are targeting ships travelling to Israel. The Houthis have declared their support for Hamas after Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza following the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed 1,200 people and saw 240 more taken hostage. Since then, Israel has killed more than 18,000 Palestinians in Gaza, Hamas health officials say. The Red Sea is one the world's most important routes for oil and fuel shipments. But the Houthis have been stepping up their attacks, using drones and rockets against foreign-owned vessels. They have also been firing drones and missiles towards Israel. The US said on Saturday its guided-missile destroyers had shot down 14 Houthi drones in the Red Sea.  In its announcement, MSC said the situation in the area had become ""serious"". It said that its container ship MSC PALATIUM III was attacked on Friday as it was transiting the Red Sea. There were no injuries to the crew, but the ship had been taken out of service. Its ships were being re-routed via the Cape of Good Hope at the southern tip of Africa. In its statement, CMA CGM - the world's third-largest shipping company - said it had instructed all its container ships there ""to reach safe areas and pause their journey in safe waters with immediate effect until further notice"".  Maersk, the world's second-biggest shipping firm, has described the situation as ""alarming"". ""Following the near-miss incident involving Maersk Gibraltar yesterday and yet another attack on a container vessel today, we have instructed all Maersk vessels in the area bound to pass through the Bab al-Mandab Strait to pause their journey until further notice,"" it told the BBC on Friday. The four companies that have now suspended operations in the area comprise four of the top five in the world - and shipping experts say the decisions are going to be costly.  ""It's security to the crew, to the ship itself and also insurance policies. Premiums are now going sky high if they can get insurance at all, so it's going to have serious implications on stock levels, on costs and the whole dynamics of supply chains,"" Sue Terpilowski from the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport, which represents companies concerned with supply chains, told the BBC. The added crewing, fuel and insurance costs are all likely to be passed on to consumers, says BBC business reporter Vivienne Nunis.  The Bab al-Mandab strait - also known as the Gate of Tears - is a channel 20 miles (32km) wide, and known for being perilous to navigate. It sits between Yemen on the Arabian Peninsula and Djibouti and Eritrea on the African coast. It is the route by which ships can reach the Suez Canal from the south - itself a major shipping lane. Avoiding it means vessels must take much longer routes, for example navigating around southern Africa. About 17,000 ships and 10% of global trade pass through it every year.

Islam Alashi, 37, left her Merseyside home to visit her sick father in Gaza just before the conflict broke out. Her husband said their five-year-old children cried for her every day as they waited for her return. They finally got their wish when she got home and surprised them at Riverside Primary School in Seacombe. ""I lost hope that I would get back to my kids,"" Ms Alashi said. She said she felt she would never see them again, adding: ""I just cuddled them in my love.  ""I feel like I'm just living a new life now. This is my new beginning with them. "" Ms Alashi, from Wallasey, travelled to Gaza on 16 September and was staying near the Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City, which became the scene of some of the heaviest fighting.  Her husband Feiz Chihaoui said she had feared she may not survive as the death toll in Gaza climbed.  After her aunt's house was damaged by shelling, Ms Alashi - whose mother died during the coronavirus pandemic - walked eight miles (13 km) to Khan Younis, accompanied by her 70-year-old father in a donkey cart. They stayed in a large tented refugee camp, drinking rainwater to survive. Ms Alashi said the ""bombing was everywhere"", adding: ""You can't sleep at all, not even for a minute. "" She was eventually allowed to cross the border into Egypt but said she felt ""guilty"" she had to leave her relatives behind. With Yemeni passports, they were not allowed to cross. She said she faced a ""very bad choice"" even though they encouraged her to leave. Since her return to the UK, Mr Chihaoui said he is ""very happy"" to have the family reunited but it was also ""hard"" for his wife to readjust. He said ""her happiness is not complete"" until her relatives can also escape Gaza. Megan Whitehead-Thompson, who works at the school, said since Ms Alashi's return her twins had become more ""excited and happy"". ""It's just been wonderful to see them all back together again,"" she said. Headteacher Christina Lahive, who joined staff in lobbying the government for Ms Alashi's return, added: ""I just can't tell you how wonderful that moment was. "" Ms Alashi, who works as an English teacher for older students, described the school staff as ""my heroes"". She added: ""They helped me a lot to escape from the war.

Younis Hawamdeh told Reuters news agency the unnamed facility had been a ""tragedy"" but did not elaborate. Israel has said all its prisoners are detained according to the law. Its prison service said on Thursday that it had freed more Palestinians, hours after Hamas let eight more hostages go.  The releases brought the totals freed to 105 hostages and 240 Palestinian prisoners. A Red Cross bus carrying the 30 Palestinians arrived in Ramallah, in the West Bank, late on Thursday, as has been customary for each of the seven exchanges.

1781,2023-12-09 12:19:10+00:00,/news/world-middle-east-67666270,"A 22-year-old Palestinian has told the BBC how he was detained with dozens of others by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in northern Gaza on Thursday. Footage verified by the BBC shows a group of men stripped to their underwear, kneeling on the ground and being guarded by Israeli soldiers. The man says he was forced to sit in the street for hours, handcuffed and blindfolded, before being driven away. An Israeli official said the soldiers were searching for Hamas members. Mark Regev, a senior adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told the BBC they were looking for those ""responsible for the massacre of October 7"". The detainees were taken by truck from Beit Lahia in northern Gaza to an unknown place, according to the young man - who asked to remain anonymous for his safety.  Once they arrived, they were randomly selected for questioning and interrogated about their relationship with Hamas, he adds. One image - which has not yet been verified by the BBC - shows men blindfolded, kneeling in what appears to be a large pit of bulldozed sand. The 22-year-old says the place that he, his father, brother and five cousins were taken to was sandy - and they were left there almost naked but given a blanket at night.  After questioning, he says he was taken to another location before being told to go home, arriving at around 01:40 in the morning. ""They released all of us, except my father and eldest cousin. My father works for UNRWA. I don't know why they took him,"" he said. ""We walked barefoot down the street in the dark, with the roads full of rocks and glass. "" UNRWA is the UN agency that supports Palestinian refugees. Mr Regev said IDF troops had been gathering people to find out who was responsible for the Hamas attacks in Israel.  They were trying to determine ""whose name and face fits with the photographs of people beheading people, or raping women and so forth"", he said. Mr Regev claimed it was possible that some were UN workers, but suggested that did not ""automatically"" mean they were not also Hamas members. He said Hamas controlled the workers' union of UNRWA and that the group had ""activists in all sorts of organisations, that shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone"". Juliette Touma, UNRWA director of communications, told the BBC that the agency ""has a scrutiny and screening process for all its staff"" which it shares ""with the host governments where we work"". ""For Gaza and the West Bank, UNRWA also shares these lists with the government of Israel as the occupying power,"" she said.   UNRWA has never received a response from Israel to these lists, she added. A second Palestinian, Mohammed Lubbad, who lives in Belgium, said on Instagram that his brother Ibrahim was detained along with 10 other family members. Mr Lubbad told the BBC he had video-called his brother on WhatsApp two hours before he was taken away. ""He told me that our house and the entire village in Beit Lahia were surrounded by Israeli forces,"" he said. ""Later, I saw the video posted on social media [of the truck]. I immediately recognised my brother and also identified some of our neighbours. "" Mr Lubbad said all his relatives were eventually released except for two cousins - Ahmed Lubbad, 35, a teacher and father-of-four, and Ayman Lubbad, a human rights activist and father-of-three. He said his family were ""innocent civilians with no military affiliation"".  One of the detained men, Diaa al-Kahlout - who has not been released yet, according to a colleague - is a correspondent for The New Arab, or Al-Araby Al-Jadeed, a London-based pan-Arab outlet. Some of those later released told al-Kahlout's family that the journalist had been transferred to Zikim military base in Israel, according to Lamis Andoni of The New Arab. ""We have no idea about his fate,"" she told BBC Radio 4's PM programme. ""The photos and videos of these men are horrifying. I'm shocked. "" Describing Mr al-Kahlout as very ambitious, she said he ""always had a smile on his face, but like many Gazans, felt suffocated"". Ms Andoni said her outlet was speaking to Israeli forces through the UN.

1782,2023-12-11 18:02:34+00:00,/news/world-us-canada-67684309,"Harvard University President Claudine Gay is facing mounting pressure to resign over her congressional testimony on antisemitism on campus. Dr Gay, 53, was forced to apologise after she failed to say whether students calling for the genocide of Jewish people would be disciplined.  Hundreds of Harvard faculty rallied behind her over the weekend, urging the university not to fire her. Her fate may be decided at a meeting of the Harvard Corporation on Monday.  Dr Gay's comments, which were widely criticised, were made at a House of Representatives hearing last week alongside Elizabeth Magill and Sally Kornbluth, her counterparts from the University of Pennsylvania and MIT. During tense questioning from Republican congresswoman Elise Stefanik, Dr Gay said she found calls for the genocide of Jews personally abhorrent but whether it would constitute a violation of Harvard's code of conduct regarding bullying and harassment depended on the context.  ""I am sorry,"" Dr Gay said in a subsequent interview with the Crimson, Harvard's campus newspaper. ""When words amplify distress and pain, I don't know how you could feel anything but regret. ""  The 13-member Harvard Corporation - one of the institution's two governing bodies - is scheduled to meet later on Monday and will reportedly discuss Dr Gay's fate and the school's potential courses of action.  Over the weekend, more than 500 faculty members signed a petition calling on Harvard to ""resist political pressures that are at odds with Harvard's commitment to academic freedom, including calls for the removal of President Claudine Gay"". By mid-morning on Monday, the number of faculty members who signed the letter had risen to nearly 700.  Alison Frank Johnson, one of the petition's co-authors, told Reuters that staff ""don't want to lose her because of a political stunt"".  ""I get the impression that many people don't know how much support she has as a scholar, colleague, and administrator within the university, including from people who sometimes disagree with her,"" she said.  In July, Dr Gay became Harvard's first black president in its 368-year history.  More than 70 members of Congress have called for her resignation alongside Ms Magill's and Dr Kornbluth's, In a letter, the mostly Republican lawmakers referred to the college presidents' answers as ""abhorrent"" and standing ""in stark contrast to the principles we expect leaders of top academic institutions to uphold"".  ""It is hard to imagine any Jewish or Israeli student, faculty or staff feeling safe when presidents of your member institutions could not say that calls for the genocide of Jews would have clear consequences on your campus,"" the letter added.  On Saturday, President Magill announced that she had ""voluntarily tendered her resignation"". It came after a major university donor withdrew a $100m (£80m) grant in protest over her comments.  Following Ms Magill's announcement that she was stepping down, Ms Stefanik again took aim at Dr Gay and Dr Kornbluth.  ""One down, two to go,"" she wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.  College campuses across the US have been the scene of frequent pro-Palestinian or pro-Israeli protests, raising concerns about both Islamophobia and antisemitism.

Expected discussion topics included the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, as well as oil production, with the UAE president.  The UAE is currently hosting the COP28 UN climate summit.  Mr Putin, who has barely left Russia since March when the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued him an arrest warrant, will also see Iran's leader on Thursday in Moscow.  The ICC has accused him of illegally deporting Ukrainian children to Russia - a war crime - but neither the UAE nor Saudi Arabia recognise the court's jurisdiction.  The Russian leader has snubbed other recent international summits including Brics in South Africa in August and the G20 summit in September in India.  The trips come as Russia is keen to project influence and undermine the West's attempts to isolate it. Mr Putin was greeted in the UAE with a full cavalry escort and motorcade while a national aerobatics team drew the Russian flag in the sky with smoke trails.   Russia's leader told UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan that ""our relations have reached unprecedented levels"". Trade and oil will be on the agenda in the UAE, which a Kremlin statement said is ""Russia's main economic partner in the Arab world"". The Russian president later travelled to Saudi Arabia to meet the kingdom's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. During a brief televised sitdown chat Mr Putin invited the crown prince to visit Moscow.  ""Nothing can prevent the development of our friendly relations,"" he said, adding that it was important ""to exchange information and assessments"" on current regional events.

Alareer's father-in-law said he had died along with his brother and sister and four of her children. He taught English literature at Gaza's Islamic University. ""My heart is broken, my friend and colleague Refaat Alareer was killed with his family,"" Gazan poet Mosab Abu Toha wrote on social media. Alareer had declined to leave northern Gaza following the start of Israeli operations in the area. Two days before he died he posted video to social media in which a number of explosions could be heard. ""The building is shaking. The debris and shrapnel are hitting the walls and flying in the streets,"" he wrote. In an interview with the BBC in the hours after Hamas's 7 October attack on Israel, Alareer caused widespread offence by calling it ""legitimate and moral"". He said it was ""exactly like the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising"". The Warsaw Ghetto Uprising was a revolt that took place in German-occupied Poland in 1943 and saw Jews use weapons smuggled into the ghetto to try to resist Nazi efforts to transport people to the extermination camps. Alareer was one of the founders of ""We Are Not Numbers"", a Palestinian non-profit set up in 2015 that joined writers from around the world with young people in Gaza to ""tell the stories behind the numbers of Palestinians in the news"". He was the co-editor of the book, Gaza Unsilenced, and the editor of Gaza Writes Back: Short Stories from Young Writers in Gaza, Palestine. Paying tribute on social media, former student Jehad Abusalim described Alareer as a mentor and friend who had ""truly cared about his students beyond the classroom"".  Alareer, he added, taught him English and viewed the language as a ""way to break free from Gaza's prolonged siege, a teleportation device that defied Israel's fences and the intellectual, academic, and cultural blockade of Gaza"". He was ""full of energy, life & humour. He loved Chicago Pizza, cats, history, classic music, theatre, poetry & Harry Potter,"" said Muhammad Shehada, a Gazan writer and communications chief at Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor. He was described as ""one of the kindest, most generous, committed, wonderful human beings I ever met"", by Palestinian-American author and activist Susan Abulhawa in a video posted on social media. ""Rest in peace, Refaat Alareer. We will continue to be guided by your wisdom, now and forever,"" Palestinian-American author and journalist Ramzy Baroud wrote. In a poem posted on X, formerly Twitter, on 1 November, Alareer wrote: ""If I must die, let it bring hope, let it be a tale"". The post has been shared tens of thousands of times. Israel destroyed the Islamic University at which Alareer taught on 11 October, saying it was an ""important Hamas operational, political and military centre in Gaza"". Following the outcry over Alareer's interview in October, a BBC spokesperson said: ""We reported the Hamas attacks and the response by Israel in line with the BBC's Editorial Guidelines. ""We have included contributors who have condemned the attackers as terrorists and we have reported that Hamas is designated as a terrorist group by many Western governments, including the UK. ""While an interviewee who made comments on the Warsaw Ghetto was robustly challenged on air, we agree his comments were offensive and we don't intend to use him again. "" In the 7 October attack, Hamas killed around 1,200 people and took 240 hostages, some of whom were released during a short-lived truce at the end of November. Hamas officials in Gaza say Israel has killed more than 17,177 people in its retaliatory campaign, including about 7,000 children.

1787,2023-12-01 00:59:28+00:00,/news/world-middle-east-67581915,"Palestinian prisoners released from Israeli jails say that guards carried out abuse and collective punishment in the weeks after the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October. They have described being hit with sticks, having muzzled dogs set on them, and their clothes, food and blankets taken away. One female prisoner has said she was threatened with rape, and that guards twice tear-gassed inmates inside the cells. The BBC spoke to six people in total, all of whom said they were beaten before leaving jail. The Palestinian Prisoners Society says some guards are alleged to have urinated on handcuffed prisoners. And that six prisoners have died in Israeli custody in the past seven weeks. Israel says all its prisoners are detained according to the law. Eighteen-year-old Mohammed Nazzal was one of those released by Israel this week, in exchange for Israeli women and children held hostage by Hamas in Gaza. He had been held in custody in Nafha Prison without charge since August, and says he does not know why he was arrested. Mohammed invited me to his home, down a winding alley in the village of Qabatiya near Jenin, in the north of the occupied West Bank. The family reception room at the top of the old house was fogged by the smoke of a dozen cigarettes - a cousin circled the visitors with a flask of coffee and a tall tower of tiny paper cups. Mohammed sat flanked by rows of male relatives, both his hands heavily bandaged, held up in front of him stiffly like a boxer, the tip of his thumbs peeking out. Ten days ago, he says, Israeli prison guards came into his cell with a microphone and speaker, and tried to provoke the prisoners by clapping and screaming their names. ""When they saw we weren't reacting,"" he says, ""they started to beat us. "" ""They arranged us so that the elderly prisoners were put in the back and the young in front. They took me and started beating me. I was trying to protect my head, and they were trying to break my legs and my hands. "" The family showed us medical reports and X-rays from Palestinian doctors in Ramallah who examined Mohammed after he was released on Monday. We showed the X-ray pictures to two doctors in the UK, who confirmed that they showed fractures in both hands. It was no surprise to Mohammed. ""In the beginning, I was in a lot of pain,"" he tells me. ""Then after a while, I knew that they were broken, so I stopped using them. I only used them when I went to the toilet. "" He says the other prisoners helped him eat, drink and use the bathroom, and that he did not ask the guards for medical help out of fear that he would be beaten again. The Israel Prison Service has disputed Mohammed's story, saying that he had been examined by a medic before leaving prison, with no medical problem diagnosed. The prison service also released a video of the teenager leaving prison and boarding a Red Cross bus before his release, which it says proves that his claims are false. In the footage, the teenager's hands are unbandaged, and appear to be hanging by his sides - including as he climbs onto the bus - but are out of shot for most of the video. Mohammed told us that the first medical treatment he received was on that Red Cross bus. A medical report from a hospital in Ramallah the day he arrived back home advised that a plate might have to be fitted, if his fractures did not heal by themselves. We asked the Red Cross to confirm Mohammed's story. They said in a statement: ""We speak directly with the detaining authorities if we have any concerns about the medical condition of detainees. Due to this dialogue, we do not speak publicly about individual cases. "" Mohammed says the behaviour of guards inside Israeli jails changed after the Hamas attacks on 7 October. He says guards kicked them, and used sticks to hit them, and describes one guard stepping on his face. ""They came in with their dogs,"" he continues. ""They let the dogs attack us and then they started beating us. "" ""They took out mattresses, our clothes, our pillows, and they threw our food on the floor. People were terrified. "" He shows me the marks on his back and shoulder that he says were the result of these beatings. ""The dog attacking me wore a muzzle with very sharp edges - his muzzle and claws left marks all over my body,"" he tells me. Beatings like this happened twice at Megiddo Prison, he says, and more times than he could count at Nafha Prison. Other Palestinian prisoners we have spoken to have described a similar shift inside Israel's jails after the Hamas attacks, saying they understood it as ""revenge"" against Palestinian prisoners for the actions of Hamas. The head of the Palestinian Prisoners Society, Abdullah al-Zaghary, told us that many prisoners had witnessed cellmates being violently beaten on their faces and bodies, and that he had heard allegations of guards urinating on handcuffed prisoners. We asked the Israel Prison Service for a response to these allegations. They said all prisoners were detained according to the law and had all the basic rights legally required. ""We are not aware of the claims you described,"" the statement said. ""Nonetheless, prisoners and detainees have the right to file a complaint that will be fully examined by official authorities. "" Lama Khater, released from prison earlier this week, published a video on social media alleging that an intelligence officer had ""explicitly threatened her with rape"" immediately after her arrest in late October. ""I was handcuffed and blindfolded,"" she told an interviewer in the video. ""They threatened to rape me. . . It was clear the goal was to intimidate me. "" Israel said these claims were made by her lawyer and had been denied by the prisoner herself. The prison service had filed a complaint for incitement, it said. But Lama Khater told us by telephone that women prisoners - including herself - had indeed been threatened with rape, and that tear gas had been used against prisoners in their dormitory at Damon Prison. The Palestinian Prisoners Society says there has been a sharp rise in the number of Palestinian deaths in custody since the 7 October attacks, with six people dying in jail since that date. Israel did not address our question about this directly, but said that four prisoners had died on four different dates over the past weeks, and that the prison service had no knowledge of the causes of death. In Qabatiya village, Mohammed Nazzal says his hands still give him pain, especially at night. His brother Mutaz told me the teenager he knew before had not returned from jail. ""This is not the Mohammed we know,"" he said. ""He was brave, courageous. Now his heart is broken and filled with terror. "" The previous night, he said, the Israeli army had carried out an operation in the city of Jenin, 4km (2.5 miles) away: ""You could see how scared he was.

1789,2023-12-07 20:29:35+00:00,/news/world-middle-east-67652774,"Rights groups say Israel should be investigated for a possible war crime over the death of a journalist in Lebanon in October. Reuters reporter Issam Abdallah, 37, died in two apparent strikes across the Israel-Lebanon border in October. Six others were wounded. Amnesty and Human Rights Watch (HRW) said investigations showed the journalists were probably fired on deliberately by an Israeli tank crew.  Israel denies targeting the reporters.  ""We do not target civilians,"" Israeli government spokesperson Eylon Levy said when asked about the reports from Amnesty and HRW. ""We've been doing everything possible to get civilians out of harm's way,"" Eylon added in a televised briefing.  The group of seven journalists from Reuters, Al-Jazeera and AFP, were filming about 1km from the Lebanon-Israel border on 13 October.  Amnesty said images showed the journalists were wearing body armour marked with the word ""PRESS"", and the Reuters crew car was marked ""TV"" with yellow tape on its bonnet. They were on a hilltop in an open area with no tree cover or other buildings to obscure them from nearby Israeli military outposts, Reuters said. Drones had been overhead and an Israeli helicopter had been patrolling, it said. Abdallah was killed instantly in the strike. Two more Reuters journalists, two from AFP and two from Al Jazeera were all wounded. AFP photographer Christina Assi, 28, later had a leg amputated and is still in hospital.  Amnesty's deputy regional director Aya Majzoub said the organisation's investigation indicated it was ""likely a direct attack on civilians"" and should be ""investigated as a war crime"". ""Those responsible for Issam Abdallah's unlawful killing and the injuring of six other journalists must be held accountable,"" Majzoub added.  Human Rights Watch (HRW) said the strikes ""were apparently deliberate attacks on civilians, which is a war crime"".  The group said its investigation showed the journalists were ""well removed from ongoing hostilities, clearly identifiable as members of the media, and had been stationary for at least 75 minutes before they were hit"". Separately, Israel Defense Force (IDF) spokesperson Richard Hecht said the military did not target journalists when Reuters presented him with its own findings on the incident. The Israeli prime minister's office did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment. AFP's global news director also said the agency had shared its latest findings with the Israeli military but had not received a response.  Sixty-three journalists have been killed since the start of the war, according to the Committee to Protect journalists.",Rights groups want Israel investigated over killed journalist,Issam Abdallah: Rights groups want Israel investigated over killed journalist,israel,http://bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-67652774,articles/article_1789.txt,results/article_1789.txt.json

Astrea Academy said it had been ""very clear with our staff about the need for sensitivity concerning these events"". Tensions between supporters of Israel and Palestine have risen since the war began in October. The staff member ""will not be at school"" while the incident is investigated, the school said. They declined to confirm whether the person was a teacher and if they had been suspended following the incident on Wednesday. An Astrea Academy Trust spokesperson said: ""We recognise that the conflict draws a range of strongly held views and for this reason we have been very clear with our staff about the need for sensitivity concerning these events.  ""The alleged incident falls short of the guidance we have given staff, and we understand that ill-considered words can unintentionally result in offence and distress. "" They added: ""We wrote to families to make them aware of what had happened, our actions and to apologise for any offence caused.  ""What happened does not reflect our values or our ethos at Astrea Academy Sheffield, where we work hard to create a welcoming and inclusive environment for everyone in our school community. "" Mark Jones, Labour councillor for Burngreave, said: ""I think the relationship between the school and the community is a bit strained, this won't help.

Mohammed Ghalayini, who lives in Manchester, chose to stay in Khan Yunis to be with his mother and sister. Fighting has resumed in Gaza after the seven-day temporary ceasefire between Israel and Hamas expired. Mr Ghalayini said warning leaflets telling people to leave Khan Yunis were ""very ominous and scary"". The British-Palestinian dual national was visiting his relatives when Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, killing 1,300 people, and has remained with family through repeated air strikes. He said he was devastated by the end of the ceasefire. ""Today, immediately around seven, the bombing returned and there was like repeated bombing for three hours, artillery and airstrikes and naval artillery as well,"" the 44-year-old said. During the pause in fighting, he said he had an ""idyllic"" time and cycled to a nearby beach, picked olives, visited friends and collected a large water container to help ensure his family's water supply. Mr Ghalayini said he had hoped the ceasefire would lead to greater de-escalation, but was terrified after leaflets dropped over Khan Yunis told residents they must leave to go to Rafah as the city was a ""dangerous combat zone"". The scientist said he feared Israel was planning to ""corral as many Gazans as possible into as smaller area as possible close to the border"" and move them permanently into nearby Egypt. About 25 people are currently staying in Mr Ghalayini's aunt's house in Khan Yunis, with more expected to join them. He said: ""People are just being pushed further and further, bit by bit, by this relentless Israeli military campaign.

1794,2023-12-15 23:06:18+00:00,/news/world-middle-east-67731853,"Danish shipping company Maersk has said it is pausing all journeys through the Red Sea. The decision comes after a spate of attacks on vessels launched from a part of Yemen controlled by the Houthis - an Iran-backed rebel movement. The group has declared its support for Hamas and say it is targeting ships travelling to Israel. The Red Sea is one the world's most important routes for oil and fuel shipments. German transport company Hapag-Lloyd later said it was making a similar move. The firm owns a ship that recently came under attack, and confirmed to the BBC later on Friday it was also suspending operations in the area until Monday. In a statement to the BBC, Maersk, one of the world's biggest shipping companies, said: ""The recent attacks on commercial vessels in the area are alarming and pose a significant threat to the safety and security of seafarers. ""Following the near-miss incident involving Maersk Gibraltar yesterday and yet another attack on a container vessel today, we have instructed all Maersk vessels in the area bound to pass through the Bab al-Mandab Strait to pause their journey until further notice. "" The Bab al-Mandab strait - also known as the Gate of Tears - is a channel 20 miles (32km) wide, and known for being perilous to navigate. It sits between Yemen on the Arabian Peninsula and Djibouti and Eritrea on the African coast. It is the route by which ships can reach the Suez Canal from the south - itself a major shipping lane. Avoiding it means vessels must take much longer routes, for example navigating around southern Africa. About 17,000 ships and 10% of global trade pass through it every year. Any ship passing through Suez to or from the Indian Ocean has to come this way. Maersk pausing its Red Sea shipping journeys ""could not come at a more difficult time"", director general at the Institute of Export & International Trade Marco Forgione said. ""This impacts every link in the supply chain. . . and will only increase the chances of critical products not making their destinations in time for Christmas,"" he added. At least two other cargo ships in the strait came under attack on Friday. The US says one was hit with a drone and another by missiles, blaming the Houthis for both attacks. The Houthis did not confirm the drone strike, but said they did fire missiles at two boats. The group has controlled parts of Yemen since seizing power from the country's government in 2014, triggering an ongoing civil war. Speaking before the announcements by Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd, US national security adviser Jake Sullivan - who is on a trip to the Middle East - said the Houthis were threatening freedom of navigation in the Red Sea, which is vital for oil and goods shipments. ""The United States is working with the international community, with partners from the region and from all over the world to deal with this threat,"" he said. Earlier this month, a US warship shot down three drones fired from Houthi-controlled territory in Yemen after three commercial vessels came under attack in the Red Sea. Just days before that incident, the US said another warship had captured armed men who had earlier seized an Israeli-linked tanker off Yemen's coast. Last month, the Houthis released video footage showing armed men dropping from a helicopter and seizing a cargo ship in the southern Red Sea.",Shipping firms pause Red Sea journeys over attacks,Shipping firms pause Red Sea journeys over attacks,israel-gaza_war,http://bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-67731853,articles/article_1794.txt,results/article_1794.txt.json

Maxim Kharkin is aged 35 and a Russian speaker, his mother told Russian media. She added that he had called her at 07:00 on the morning of the attack. Elkana Bohbot, 34, had gone to the party with friends and, before losing contact, he spoke to his wife and mother telling them he was helping to evacuate the wounded, the Times of Israel reported. Hours later, his family found a video of him posted online by Hamas, which has been seen by BBC Verify.  Rom Braslavski, 19, was working on security for the festival. According to an account published by Hostages and Missing Families Forum, he was trying to rescue an injured person in the attack when he was caught in a volley of fire. He has not been heard from since. Omer Wenkert, 22, a restaurant manager, sent a message to his family to say he was going to a safe shelter but then lost contact, his father Shai Wenkert told the BBC's Today Programme. Shai Wenkert said he had seen footage of his son in captivity, including a photo of him handcuffed and wearing only underwear.  Evyatar David, 23, was at the festival and on the morning of the attacks, described fleeing from gunfire before losing contact with the outside world, his brother says. Later, his family say, Evyatar's sister posted on Instagram appealing for information about his whereabouts. She then received a text from an unknown number, which contained video footage of Evyatar handcuffed on the floor of a dark room. According to Israel's foreign ministry he is being held captive by Hamas in Gaza. Eitan Mor, 23, lives in Jerusalem, and was working as a security guard at the festival, the Times of Israel said. He reportedly texted his uncle after Hamas arrived and was last seen with a friend bringing others to safety. Alon Ohel, 22, a Serbian citizen, took refuge in a shelter after the festival came under attack, his family say. They have seen footage of him being dragged away after a grenade attack. Almog Meir Jan, 21, tried to flee the festival. He and a friend made it to the friend's car but only managed to drive a short distance before being forced to stop. Almog's family say they have seen a hostage video in which he appears.  Inbar Heiman, a student aged 21, was seen by two young Israeli men being taken away from the festival on a motorcycle. Hamas have released a video in which she is seen very briefly.  Hersh Goldberg-Polin, 23, a dual US-Israeli citizen, was badly injured in the attack, his family told the BBC. Eyewitness accounts say  he was seen being forced onto a white pick-up truck - the last-known signal from his phone came from just inside Gaza. Segev Kalfon, 26, was running away from the festival, across the highway, when he was captured by Hamas, according to the Hostages and Missing Families Forum. Orión Hernández Radoux, 30, from Mexico, attended the festival with his girlfriend, Shani Louk. He has not been seen since. The Sun newspaper says it has seen threatening messages written in Arabic sent from his phone. Shani, a tourist from Germany, was initially thought to be among those seized. But on 30 October, her mother Ricarda told German media that the family had been informed by Israeli military of her death following DNA identification. Romi Lesham Gonen, 23, was on the phone to her mother as she tried to escape from the Supernova festival. Merav Leshem Gonan has recounted a conversation in which her daughter begged for help after being shot. ABC News reports that Romi's phone is now in Gaza.  Bar Kuperstein, 21, last spoke to his family early on the morning of 7 October, as the attack unfolded. Later the same day, his family say they identified him in a video of Israeli prisoners, posted by Hamas. Since then, they say they have had no further information. Eliya Cohen, 26, was hiding with his girlfriend Ziv from the attack, when Ziv felt him being pulled up and driven away by the gunmen, Eliya's mother has told the video initiative #BringThemHomeNow. The family then found a photo of Eliya in Gaza, the Times of Israel reported.   Amit Buskila, 28, from Ashdod, was last heard of making a call to her uncle, Shimon, as Hamas overran the festival. Her family say they have now been told by the government that she is being held in Gaza. Carmel Gat, 39, is Jordan's sister-in-law, and also was seen by her father being taken by gunmen from Kibbutz Be'eri, Haaretz newspaper reported. She has not been heard from since.  Ohad Yahalomi, 49, was abducted from Nir Oz, along with his 12-year-old son, Eitan, who was released during the November ceasefire.  Dror Or, 48, was seen by a neighbour being dragged out of his home in Be'eri, according to their nephew Emmanuel Besorai, along with his son and daughter. On Saturday 25 November Dror's son Noam, 17, and daughter Alma, 13, were released from captivity. The body of Yonat, 50 - Dror's wife and the children's mother - was identified among the 120 people murdered at the kibbutz, Yonat's brother told the Guardian newspaper. Tal Shoham, 38, was taken from Kibbutz Be'eri. His wife Adi, also 38, her mother Dr Shoshan Haran, 67, were released by Hamas on 25 November, along with the couple's children Nave, eight, and Yahel, three. Dr Haran's husband, Avshalom - an economist and dual German/Israeli citizen - was killed on 7 October. Tamir Adar, 38, who defended Nir Oz as part of the kibbutz's emergency squad, was taken to Gaza, the Times of Israel reported. Sagui Dekel-Chen, 35, an American-Israeli citizen, has been missing since Hamas's attack on Nir Oz, his father Jonathan told the BBC. He said his son was not found among the dead and the ""only reasonable explanation"" is that he was taken to Gaza. Thailand's ambassador to Israel says 26 of its citizens were taken hostage, 23 of whom have now been released.  Those still being held are believed to include Watchara Sriuan, 32. His mother, Viewwaew, told the Thaiger news site that the family had been informed he was being held captive.  Kiattisak ""Top"" Patee and a Mr Pongtorn (no first name given) have also been named by the Thai foreign ministry as hostages.  A number of other people thought to have been held hostage are now confirmed to have died, either during the 7 October attack or while in captivity.  As well as Ron Scherman and Nik Beizer, four bodies were identified this week. They were Tal Chaimi, an Israeli-Romanian citizen aged 41, and Joshua Mollel, a 19-year-old Tanzanian student. Also, 27-year-old Eden Zecharya, who was kidnapped from the Nova music festival, and 36-year-old Ziv Dado, who had already been declared dead by the Israeli military. Others known to have died include Dror Kaplun, 68, Aviv Atzili, 49, Arye Zalmanovich, 85, Ronen Engel, 54, Maya Goren, 56, Guy Iluz, 26, Ofir Tzarfati, 27, Ofra Keider, 70, and Eliyahu Margalit, 75.  The bodies of 19-year-old soldier, Noa Marciano, and 65-year-old Yehudit Weiss were found by Israeli troops in buildings close to Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City. On Saturday 9 December Kibbutz Bari announced that Sahar Baruch, 25, had been killed in Gaza.  Other hostages whose death has been reported, but not confirmed include Shiri Bibas, 32, and her two young children, Ariel and Kfir.

1797,2023-12-20 13:28:19+00:00,/news/world-middle-east-67771533,"While a full ceasefire in the Gaza Strip still looks a long way off, there are fresh signs that a new pause in fighting between Israel and Hamas could be possible. However, that would require a shift in Hamas's public position. It has consistently said that it will only free more Israeli hostages in exchange for a permanent ceasefire. Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, who usually lives in Doha, has now travelled to Cairo along with a ""high level"" delegation for talks with Egypt's intelligence chief, Abbas Kamel.   That indicates a level of seriousness. Both Egypt and Qatar play key roles in mediation efforts and helped secure a week-long truce late last month. Israel maintains that the war in Gaza will only end when its goal of dismantling Hamas - which has governed there since 2007 - has been achieved. According to mainstream Israeli media reports, Israel has presented a plan to mediators which could secure the release of some 30 to 40 hostages. This prioritises the remaining women, as well as men who are elderly or in need of urgent medical care. It is thought that they could be exchanged for Palestinians held in Israeli prisons who have been convicted of more serious offences than the women and teenagers released in the previous deal, and that a truce could last for a week or two. The Israeli President, Isaac Herzog, told foreign diplomats on Tuesday that his country was ready for ""another humanitarian pause, and additional humanitarian aid in order to enable the release of hostages"".  Later, after meeting a select group of families with loved ones held in captivity in Gaza, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that ""retrieving them is a top goal"". He confirmed that the head of Israel's Mossad spy agency had been twice to Europe in recent days to promote a new release deal. On Monday, in Poland, he and his US counterpart met the Qatari prime minister. Israeli leaders have continued to assert that only strong military pressure on Hamas will bring it to the negotiating table. However, the families of the remaining hostages have openly expressed scepticism about that. Their anxiety has risen since Friday's accidental killing by Israeli forces of three hostages.  In recent days, Hamas and Islamic Jihad, a smaller armed faction, have put out two videos showing a total of five men still held captive, pleading to be brought home. All appear thin and the speakers say they fear becoming victims of Israel's bombardment. Next week, the head of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Ziyad al-Nakhalah, is also due to travel to Cairo with other senior officials from his group. It is believed that more than 100 hostages remain alive in Gaza, after 105 civilians were released from captivity in late November, most of them Israeli women and children.  Four hostages had been released prior to that and one had been rescued by Israeli troops.  A number of bodies have also been recovered and the Israeli prime minister's office has confirmed the deaths of more than 20 people who had been held by Hamas.  At a global level, there are growing calls for a complete ceasefire, including at the UN General Assembly. With the death toll now close to 20,000 in Gaza, according to local health officials in the Hamas-run territory, the UN estimates that 1.9 million of Gaza's 2.3 million residents have fled or lost their homes. There is growing concern about the limited scope for aid agencies to help them. ""Amid displacement at an unimaginable scale and active hostilities, the humanitarian response system is on the brink,"" Tor Wennesland, the UN's Special Co-ordinator for the Middle East Peace Process told the Security Council on Tuesday. While UN officials say much more needs to be done, a new pause in fighting could at least allow a boost in aid delivery and distribution.",Talks on new pause in Gaza war gain urgency,Talks on new pause in Gaza war gain urgency as Hamas chief visits Cairo,"israel,palestinian_territories,israel_and_the_palestinians,israel-gaza_war,hamas",http://bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-67771533,articles/article_1797.txt,results/article_1797.txt.json

Joshua Mollel was working as an agricultural intern at a kibbutz which was attacked by Hamas gunmen on 7 October. Tanzania's Foreign Minister January Makamba says Mr Mollel was killed immediately after he was taken hostage. Fellow student Clemence Felix Mtenga was also killed in the attack. Loitu Mollel, Joshua's father, has been notified about the death of his son, the minister added. ""We are planning to take Mr Mollel, another family member and a government official to Israel to get more information on the matter,"" Mr Makamba posted on X, formerly Twitter. The Mollel family has not yet commented.  In a Facebook post, authorities in Kibbutz Nahal Oz said Mr Mollel's body was being held by Hamas. The two Tanzanian students had travelled to Israel just a month before the 7 October attack. It was initially reported that they were among the 240 people taken hostage by Hamas. According to Tanzania officials, around 350 Tanzanians live in Israel, mostly students pursuing agricultural-related studies.  Dozens of residents of Kibbutz Nahal Oz were among the 1,200 people killed by Hamas fighters on 7 October. Since then, some 18,600 people have been killed in the Israeli operation in Gaza, Hamas says.",Tanzania says student killed in Israel by Hamas,Joshua Mollel: Tanzania says student killed in Israel by Hamas,israel-gaza_war,http://bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-67713520,articles/article_1799.txt,results/article_1799.txt.json

Binyamin Needham, 19, reportedly moved from England to Israel with his family when he was eight-years-old. He is at least the second UK citizen to have died while serving in the Israeli military during the current conflict. Mr Needham's sister told Israeli media her brother was ""always smiling, always loving"" and had only recently completed his training. Speaking to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, sister Orly said:  ""He was so proud, and he had just finished basic training. He was happy to defend the country. "" She told Israeli public broadcaster Kan News Mr Needham was ""happy to be in the army and to be protecting the Jewish people and our homeland"", adding: ""We are so, so proud of him. "" Mr Needham's death was confirmed by the IDF in a statement, which said he had been posthumously promoted to the rank of sergeant.  He was one of three fatalities confirmed by the Israeli military on Monday, taking its death toll to 75 since the current conflict between Israel and Gaza broke out. An IDF statement said Mr Needham was serving with the Combat Engineering Corps and ""fell in battle in the northern Gaza Strip"". Nathanel Young, 20, was the first British solider serving with the IDF to be killed. He died on 7 October near the border with Gaza, his family said.

1802,2023-12-18 22:13:13+00:00,/news/world-asia-67746356,"""Am I lucky or unlucky?"" Wichian Temthong pondered the question. ""I guess I'm lucky, because I'm still here, still alive. "" The 37-year-old farm worker is one of 23 Thai hostages who were released by Hamas last month. Now Wichian is back in Thailand, living in a small room in an industrial suburb south of Bangkok with his wife Malai.  While he survived, three young Israeli men he met in captivity did not. They were mistakenly shot dead by Israeli soldiers.  Wichian had gone to Israel only in late September, driven like so many Thais from the poor north-east of the country to find better-paid work on Israeli farms. After nine days he was moved to an avocado orchard on the Kfar Aza kibbutz. He woke up on 7 October, his first morning there, to the sound of gunfire.  His fellow Thai workers assured him it was normal. But as the shooting got louder towards midday, they decided to lock themselves in one of the buildings. Before they could do that gunmen burst in, one holding a hand grenade. They started beating the Thais with their rifle butts. ""I crouched down like this and shouted 'Thailand, Thailand, Thailand', he said, showing how he pulled his arms over his head. ""But they kept beating me. All I could do was keep my face down. One guy stamped on me with his feet. I crawled under the bed to hide. I tried to text my wife to say I was being taken, but they dragged me out by my leg. "" Wichian was eventually taken down into tunnels deep under Gaza, and would be kept there for 51 days. His was a lonely ordeal, because he was the only Thai, and he speaks no English, so could only communicate through drawings and hand gestures.  Conditions were grim. The hostages were fed just once a day; sometimes this was no more than a piece of bread and a dried date. ""When I was distressed they would come and talk to me, to calm me down, but I could not understand them. The only way I got by was by thinking of the faces of my children, my wife and my mother.  ""When there was nothing else to do, I'd just sit against the wall and meditate. I kept thinking about the same thing over and over, which was that I had to survive. "" He remembers the other hostages who were with him in the tunnels; three young Israeli men - Yotam, Sammy and Alon - who remained in captivity after his release, only to be shot dead by nervous Israeli soldiers as they came out, waving a white cloth, last Friday.  He had just seen the news, with their photographs, when we arrived to interview him. ""Every day my foreign friends and I tried to support each other. We would shake hands and do fist bumps. They would cheer me up by hugging me and clapping my shoulder. But we could only communicate by using our hands. "" He found out that Yotam was a drummer, and Sammy loved riding his motorbike, and worked in a chicken farm. Wichian tried to teach them some Thai words. Wichian said two of the Israelis were in the tunnel with him from day one. The third joined them on 9 October. He says he was treated leniently by his captors, but that in their first weeks underground two of the Israelis were sometimes beaten with electric cables. ""We were always hungry. We could only sip our water. A large bottle had to last four to five days, a smaller bottler for two days. ""  He really suffered from not being able to wash. They were allowed to sleep in the day, not at night. They were always damp - nothing dried in the tunnels.  He kept himself busy by trying to clean their living area. He even helped the Hamas guards move rubble that came into the tunnel after it was struck by a bomb. After a month the four hostages were moved to a new tunnel. ""At around 7pm they brought us up. But as soon as I saw it, my heart wanted to run back down to the tunnel.  ""You could see bright lights everywhere from the aerial fighting. I heard drones flying all over the place, and the sound of gunfire. We had to run for 20 minutes, trying to avoid the drones. "" Wichian says his captors encouraged him to count the days on a calendar, and even brought him a clock, because he kept asking them the time.  The end of his ordeal came suddenly. ""They came pointing to me and saying 'you, you go home, Thailand'. "" He saw daylight for the first time in 51 days, and was handed over to the Red Cross and driven over the border to Egypt. ""All the time I was down there I never shed a tear. But once I came up, and saw the two other released Thais, I hugged them and cried. We had a group hug and sat down with tears filling our eyes, asking ourselves how we could have survived.  ""When I got back to Thailand they gave me a new name. They called me 'the survivor' and 'Mr Plenty of Fortune'. "" However, he still needs to pay back the substantial debt he incurred - around 230,000 Thai baht ($6,570; £5,180) - to cover the cost of his trip to Israel. He never had the chance to earn any money there.  So, like his wife, Wichian is taking a job in a factory. The salary is low - just 800 baht a day. They cannot save much. Their two children are living with their grandparents in their home province of Buri Ram.  Wichian sometimes has trouble sleeping, and wakes up calling for his mother. But, he says, he would go back to Israel, just for the chance to earn, and save, a little more.",The man held with the hostages Israel mistakenly killed,Israel-Gaza: The man held with the hostages Israel mistakenly killed,"israel-gaza_war,hamas",http://bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-67746356,articles/article_1802.txt,results/article_1802.txt.json
1803,2023-12-17 00:51:26+00:00,/news/world-middle-east-67740329,"The disastrous incident in which Israel Defense Forces (IDF) troops shot dead three Israeli hostages in Gaza on Friday, mistaking them for Hamas fighters despite their waving a white cloth, is a graphic illustration of the risks involved in armed hostage rescue.  Maj Gen Charlie Herbert, a retired British Army general who served on 13 operational tours including Iraq and Afghanistan, told the BBC: ""As desperately sad as it is, the shooting dead of the three hostages. . . again calls into question IDF tactics, proportionality and distinction. One can only imagine how many civilians have been killed in similar circumstances. ""  The IDF says it takes great care to avoid harming civilians, but the horrific death toll in Gaza - more than 18,000 and rising - has caused Israel to be accused of indiscriminate bombing.  In nearly every case of kidnap in history, those abducted stand a far better chance of emerging alive and unscathed through mediation and a deal, rather than by armed intervention.  One of the first hostage cases I covered was when Al-Qaeda-linked jihadists in Yemen abducted 16 Western tourists in 1998. The British ambassador went to see the interior minister to press for a negotiated release of the hostages. Too late, he was told, the Yemeni army has already gone in. A quarter of those kidnapped were killed in the ensuing firefight, with others injured. Western and Israeli special forces have spent decades perfecting the art of hostage rescue, but even then it doesn't always go to plan. Israel's Operation Thunderbolt in Entebbe, Uganda in 1976 rescued 102 of the 106 hostages, but the commander of the Israeli commandos was killed. Today his brother, Benjamin Netanyahu, is prime minister.  The 1980 SAS siege of the Iranian embassy in London is perhaps the most iconic hostage rescue of modern times, as it took place in the full glare of the TV cameras.  When a British journalist, Stephen Farrell, was kidnapped by the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2009 he was rescued by British Special Forces. But the raid also resulted in the deaths of one of his rescuers, two civilians and his Afghan interpreter.  The following year a US Navy SEAL team attempted to rescue the British aid worker Linda Norgrove, also kidnapped by the Taliban in Afghanistan. The raid killed her kidnappers but she died from a grenade thrown by one of her rescuers.  In 2012 a British Special Forces operation to free one British and one Italian hostage in Nigeria was ruined when one of the Nigerian soldiers fired his weapon prematurely, alerting the kidnappers who then murdered their captives. Many hostage cases in Yemen have been resolved peacefully over the years, usually through lengthy tribal negotiations accompanied by interminable narcotic qat-chewing sessions. But ultimately, much depends on the demands and intentions of the kidnappers.  In the case of Al-Qaeda in Iraq and the Islamic State group (IS), the jihadist kidnappers never really had any intention of releasing their US and British captives. Instead they were aiming for maximum psychological impact by killing them on camera. In those situations, armed intervention, if they can be located, is usually the only option available. Hamas is something of a hybrid case. The atrocities committed in their raid into southern Israel on 7 October were gratuitously cruel and violent. Yet they have subsequently been willing to bargain the release of more than 100 hostages.  Today, Israel's hostage relatives are all too aware that nearly all those already released won their freedom not by daring military action but by painstaking negotiations and mediation by Qatar and Egypt, backed by the United States. To date, only one Israeli hostage, Private Ori Megedish, has been rescued by force. But doing a deal with kidnappers, especially those considered by many governments to be terrorists, can be a bitter pill to swallow. Hostage-takers will demand something in return.  In the case of Hamas, that has meant releasing large numbers of prisoners from Israeli jails, pausing the fighting and significantly increasing the amount of aid getting into Gaza.  Yet any further successful return of the hostages, says Gen Herbert, can only come about through diplomatic means: ""There is no effective military solution to this issue in Gaza.

1804,2023-12-14 06:01:30+00:00,/news/world-middle-east-67701700,"Just getting to the end of the day and surviving the night must feel like a miracle in the Gaza Strip. Palestinians ""plead for safety"", wrote Philippe Lazzarini, head of UNRWA, the main UN relief agency in Gaza, in an ""endless, deepening tragedy… hell on earth"". It must be just as hellish for the hostages taken by Hamas and for the families of their victims. War is a cruel furnace that puts humans through terrible agonies. But its heat can produce changes that seemed impossible.  It happened in western Europe after World War Two. Old enemies who had killed each other for centuries chose peace. Will the war in Gaza shock Israelis and Palestinians into ending their century of conflict over the land between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan river?  I've been watching a video of a woman wracked by grief, sitting next to the body of her husband, Muhammad Abu Shaar. As Israel and Egypt are not allowing journalists to enter Gaza, I have not met her. I haven't been able to find out her name, which was not posted alongside those of her dead husband and children.  In the video, it is as if she hopes, somehow, that the power of her grief will bring him back.  ""I swear, we promised to die together. You died and left me. What are we supposed to do, God? Muhammad, get up! For God's sake my beloved, I swear to God, I love you. For God's sake get up. Our children Nour and Aboud are here with you. Get up. ""  The two children were with their father because all three of them had just been killed by Israel. An air strike destroyed the house they were hoping would shelter them in Rafah.  I visited Yonatan Zeigen at his flat in Tel Aviv. It was a comfortable home, full of his children's toys. Among the family photos I recognised his mother, Vivian Silver, who was one of Israel's leading campaigners for peace with the Palestinians. Vivian was in the family home in kibbutz Be'eri, on the border with Gaza, when Hamas attacked on 7 October. The first time I met Yonatan, in the days after their kibbutz was attacked, he was hoping his mother had been taken into Gaza as a hostage.  When he heard the air raid sirens in Tel Aviv, he rang Vivian. They switched to WhatsApp as they heard gunfire and explosions in the kibbutz, hoping that if she made no noise, Hamas would bypass the house.  He read out the texts they exchanged, first some black humour and suddenly serious and full of love as she realised a massacre was happening. ""She wrote me, they're inside the house, it's time to stop joking and say goodbye,"" he tells me. ""And I wrote back that 'I love you, Mum. I have no words, I'm with you'. Then she writes, 'I feel you'. And then that was it, that's the last message. "" The next day, I visited her house in the kibbutz and saw it was burnt out. It took weeks for investigators to find Vivian Silver's remains in the ash left behind in the safe room. Yonatan has given up his career as a social worker to campaign for peace. ""They came into my country and killed my mother because we didn't have peace. So, to me, this just proves the point that we need it,"" he says. ""It could go either way. Catastrophes like this create changes in societies in the world. And I believe that it can lead to a better future. "" Issa Amro is a Palestinian activist in Hebron in the West Bank. The city is holy to Muslims and Jews, who revere it as the burial place of the prophet Abraham. It has been a flashpoint for decades.  Issa is well known in Hebron and considered a troublemaker by Israeli soldiers who have enforced a curfew on Palestinians who live near the Jewish settlement in the heart of the city. He told me he was detained and beaten after the 7 October attacks.  Like Yonatan Zeigen in Tel Aviv, Issa Amro believes that the war could produce a chance for Israelis and Palestinians to lead better and safer lives.  ""I think it's two opportunities. Either we choose to make it deeper and worse, or we make it as an opportunity to solve the conflict and to solve the occupation, to solve the apartheid and make living together possible because the security solution failed… only peace is the solution. ""  It might seem a long way off now, and many more people are going to be killed before it happens, but like every war this one will stop.  All the wars in and around Gaza since Hamas seized control there in 2007 have ended the same way, with a ceasefire deal. The ceasefires all came with a fatal flaw that guaranteed the next war between Israel and Hamas. That was because no attempt was made to end a century of conflict between Palestinians and Israelis.  The killing and destruction in this war are of such a different order that no one can pretend there is any kind of normality to restore. This time it must be different. That much is accepted by Palestinians and Israelis and the outside powers that matter the most.  The problem is agreeing which future to try to create. The Israeli government is heading for a diplomatic row with the United States, its most important ally, about what happens after the ceasefire.  President Joe Biden is exasperated by what he called Israel's ""indiscriminate bombing"" of Gaza. Even so, he continues to back Israel, as he has since the start of the war, by deploying aircraft carriers, sending planeloads of weapons and vetoing ceasefire resolutions at the UN Security Council. In return, Joe Biden wants Israel to agree that the only way forward is revive talks to establish an independent Palestinian state. That was the objective of the Oslo peace process, which failed after years of negotiations.  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not said much about how Gaza would be governed if and when he declares victory over Hamas. But he has rejected Joe Biden's plan.  One constant in Netanyahu's long political career has been opposition to the independent Palestinian state that Oslo tried and failed to produce.  Total victory and the unconditional surrender of anyone left alive in Hamas remain Israel's objectives. Annihilating Hamas, Mr Netanyahu believes, is the only way to rescue the hostages.  A few hours before Mr Biden said Israel's bombing was indiscriminate, Mr Netanyahu made his own speech.  ""I will not allow Israel to repeat the mistake of Oslo,"" he said. ""After the great sacrifice of our civilians and our soldiers, I will not allow the entry into Gaza of those who educate for terrorism, support terrorism and finance terrorism. Gaza will be neither Hamastan nor Fatahstan. "" Fatahstan is a derogatory reference to the Palestinian Authority, the rival to Hamas, which recognises Israel and co-operates with it on security.  Israeli domestic politics feed into Mr Netanyahu's calculations. Opinion polls indicate that many Israelis blame him for the intelligence and security failures that allowed Hamas to break into Israel with such force. By doubling down on his opposition to Palestinian self-determination, Mr Netanyahu is trying to regain the trust of the right-wing Jewish nationalists who support his government. Yonatan Zeigen, the son of the slain peace campaigner Vivian Silver, says his mother would have been heartbroken to see the war, believing that wars cause more wars.  ""I think she would have said 'not in my name'… a war, if we're not too naïve, should be a means, right? But it feels like this war is a cause in itself, of revenge. ""  Yonatan senses a new opportunity, to put peace back on Israel's political agenda.  Peace campaigners were prominent in Israel until they were discredited as an armed Palestinian uprising erupted after the Oslo process collapsed in 2000. The idea of peace with the Palestinians vanished from mainstream Israeli politics. Now, Yonatan hopes, it is inching its way back.  ""Absolutely. You couldn't even say the word. And now people are talking about it. "" Issa Amro, the Palestinian activist in Hebron, told me life there is much harder for Palestinians since 7 October.  ""It got much worse. Ten times worse. More restrictions. More violence. More intimidation. People don't feel safe at all. People don't have enough food to eat. People don't get any access to a social life. No schools, no kindergartens, no work. It's a collective punishment inside an area which is very restricted. ""  Issa got into a verbal spat with a group of Israeli soldiers while we were walking with him through the centre of Hebron. One of them, in combat gear, with an assault rifle and large pistol in a holster, wearing a black mask that only exposed his eyes, listened closely as Issa told me that peace was the only way ahead as there was no military solution to the conflict. The soldier wouldn't give his name when he butted into the conversation.  ""You don't know what it's like to grow up in Israel with neighbours like this,"" he said. ""Gay rights, they beat the women, I saw this with my eyes. Yes. They kill their daughters if they have an affair with someone they don't like. They [Palestinians] are violent. I know them, I live with them. They don't want peace… They hate me. You know I can feel it. I know all the stuff they are telling. I don't talk to them. "" A chance for a peaceful future, for an independent Palestinian state alongside a secure Israel that the Americans, the British and many other countries say they want, will not emerge without sustained diplomatic and political will and determination.  The old Oslo format, of negotiations between the Palestinians and Israelis brokered by the Americans, ended in failure.  If there is a next time, one idea mentioned by senior Western diplomats is to make Palestinian independence a crucial part of a broader package of change in the Middle East. Israel would be offered the prize of mutual recognition with Saudi Arabia, if they made the concessions necessary for Palestinian independence. Jordan and Egypt would be crucial players, as countries who have made lasting peace with Israel. Also vital would be Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, immensely wealthy Gulf states. Like the Saudis, they need peace in the Middle East as they spend hundreds of billions establishing themselves as global players.  A blueprint already exists. Twenty years ago, the Saudi peace plan offered Israel full recognition and peace with Arab states, in return for a viable and sovereign Palestinian state in Gaza and the West Bank, with a capital in East Jerusalem. It could be relaunched by extending the existing Abraham Accords between Israel and some Arab countries, but adding to it the price tag of a Palestinian state.  It is an ambitious idea, that would not happen without new Israeli and Palestinian leaders who believed in the project.  The Americans could mediate, though they would have to be even-handed, something they have never managed before. Both sides would have to be prepared to make painful compromises on cherished beliefs, especially concerning territory. Political storms would break over leaders prepared to take risks for peace.  Israel's Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated by a Jewish extremist in 1995 when he tried to make peace with the Palestinians. An Islamist extremist killed Egypt's President Anwar Sadat because he made peace with Israel.  And the war in Gaza would have to end as soon as possible. If it spreads, nightmare scenarios include desperate Palestinians breaching the Egyptian border as Israeli tanks close in and the escalation into full-scale war of the current cross-border exchanges between Israel and the Lebanese militia group Hezbollah.  So much needs to go right for peace to have a chance. So much has already gone wrong that peace might just be impossible.",The price of peace between Israelis and Palestinians,Israel-Gaza war: What is the price of peace?,"israel,israel-gaza_war,hamas",http://bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-67701700,articles/article_1804.txt,results/article_1804.txt.json
1805,2023-12-09 09:48:23+00:00,/news/world-middle-east-67652494,"At the end of the war that started on 7 October lies a big, unknown place called the future. The old status quo was dangerous and painful, especially for Palestinians living under Israeli occupation. But it was familiar. Then after 7 October it was smashed by the Hamas attacks, and Israel's response.  The shock of war can speed up change, when it sweeps away old thinking, forcing difficult choices for a better future. Or it drives leaders and their citizens deeper into their bunkers, as they prepare for the next round.  For more than a century, Jews and Arabs have been confronting each other, and sometimes going to war, over control of the small, highly coveted piece of land between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea. Perhaps the safest, saddest bet is to assume that the conflict, reshaped, will go on. After all, that is what has happened after every other Middle East war since 1948, when Israel won its independence.  But there are other options. Here are some of the arguments made by individuals at the centre of events.  Israel's prime minister has not spelt out his plan for the day after, if he has one. His opponents in Israel, who blame him for security and intelligence failures that made the Hamas attacks on 7 October possible, say Netanyahu's only real plan is to stay in power and avoid conviction on the serious corruption charges he faces.  Netanyahu built his career on the message he was Mr Security, the only man who could keep Israel safe. Hamas shattered his brand, which was already badly damaged by political strife inside Israel.  The prime minister's broad statements about what happens after the war, assuming Israel can declare victory, all point to continued occupation of Gaza. Israeli officials have reportedly talked about setting up buffer zones along the border, without offering any details.  Netanyahu has rejected a role for foreign peacekeepers, assuming they can be found. Jordan's foreign minister Ayman Safadi has already said that Arab states would not ""clean the mess"" left by Israel.  ""There will be no Arab troops going to Gaza. None. We are not going to be seen as the enemy. ""  Netanyahu has also dismissed US President Joe Biden's plan to replace Hamas with the Palestinian Authority, led by President Mahmoud Abbas. Netanyahu claims the PA cannot be trusted and supports terrorism, even though it recognises Israel and cooperates with it on security.  President Biden's vision of the future is very different to Benjamin Netanyahu's. Biden continues to give considerable military, diplomatic and emotional support to Israelis. He visited, embraced the families of hostages and has ordered his diplomats at the United Nations Security Council to use the US veto to block ceasefire resolutions. Biden ordered two aircraft carrier strike groups to the region and has sent Israel vast amounts of weaponry.  In return, the US president wants Israel to return to some kind of revitalised peace process. He wants the Palestinian Authority (PA) eventually to run Gaza while Israel agrees arrangements for an independent Palestine alongside Israel.  The Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas agrees. He has largely been a bystander since 7 October. In a rare interview this week, with Reuters, he said there should be a peace conference after the war to work out a political solution that would lead to the establishment of a Palestinian state.  The ""two state solution"" has been the official objective of America and its western allies since the early 1990s. Years of negotiations to make it happen failed. For almost a quarter of a century, since the peace process collapsed, the phrase has been an empty slogan. Biden wants to revive it, arguing correctly that only a political solution will end the conflict.  Biden sent his vice president, Kamala Harris, to Dubai last week to make a speech laying out America's red lines for Gaza on the day after.  She laid out five principles.  ""No forcible displacement, no re-occupation, no siege or blockade, no reduction in territory, and no use of Gaza as a platform for terrorism. ""  ""We want to see a unified Gaza and West Bank under the Palestinian Authority, and Palestinian voices and aspirations must be at the centre of this work. "" In and out of office, Benjamin Netanyahu has worked consistently hard to thwart Palestinian independence. It is safe to say he is not about to change his mind. If the two-state solution can be revived, it won't happen while he is prime minister.  I went to see Simcha Rotman at the Knesset, Israel's parliament, where he is a prominent MP for the far-right Religious Zionist Party. The government of Benjamin Netanyahu depends on the support of Rotman's party and other hard-line Jewish nationalists. Their power comes from the dynamism of the movement to settle Jews on the land captured in 1967. From that moment of victory, some Israelis were set on extending the Zionist enterprise into the newly occupied Palestinian territories: the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip.  Since 1967 they have been highly successful, despite being forced to leave Gaza when Israel pulled out in 2005. Around 700,000 Israeli Jews now live in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Settler leaders are in the cabinet, and their enterprise is at the centre of Israeli politics.  Now that Israel is fighting Hamas, vowing to smash the organisation once and for all, Jewish nationalists see the biggest opportunity they have had since 1967, when Israel beat all its Arab neighbours in a war that lasted for six days.  Since 7 October, armed settlers in the West Bank, backed by soldiers and police, have prevented Palestinian farmers from harvesting their olives or tending their fields. Settlers have paved illegal roads and sought to entrench themselves even deeper by consolidating outposts that are illegal under Israeli as well as international law. Posters are everywhere demanding the return of Jewish settlers to Gaza.  Settlers have also killed Palestinians and invaded their homes. Men with bulldozers came at night to destroy the tiny village of Khirbet Zanuta, near Hebron. Its population of 200 Palestinians had already left, forced out by armed and aggressive settlers.  International law says an occupying power should not settle its citizens in land it has captured. Israel says the law does not apply.  ""Occupation is not the word,"" Simcha Rotman told me at the Knesset.  ""You cannot occupy your own land. Israel is not an occupier in Israel because that's the land of Israel. ""  For Simcha Rotman and other Jewish nationalists, Gaza is also part of the land of Israel.  ""We need to make sure that the only people that are in charge of our security in the land of Israel are the IDF [Israel Defence Forces]. We cannot have any terrorist organisation, doesn't matter what its name. Would it be Hamas? Would it be Fatah? Doesn't matter. The terrorist organisation cannot have control of our lives. "" If there are Palestinian elections after the 7 October war ends, Mustafa Barghouti is likely to run for president. He is the secretary general of the Palestine National Initiative. It wants to be the third force in Palestinian politics, an alternative to the Islamist extremists in Hamas and to Fatah, the faction led by President Mahmoud Abbas, which it regards as corrupt and incompetent. Barghouthi believes resistance to occupation is legitimate and legal, though he wants it to be non-violent.  In his office in Ramallah on the West Bank, Mustafa Barghouthi told me that Israel is using the war to deliver a crushing blow not just to Hamas but to the idea of Palestinian independence and freedom. Like many Palestinians, Barghouthi sees what's happening as a grim echo of the events of 1948 when Israel won its independence and more than 700,000 Palestinians fled or were forced at gunpoint to leave their homes in what became Israel. Palestinians call it al-Naqba, ""the catastrophe"" and believe Israel wants it to happen again.  ""I am 100% sure that their main goal right from the beginning was the ethnic cleansing of Gaza, complete ethnic cleansing of Gaza, trying to push people to Egypt, a terrible war crime. And if they managed to do so, I think their next goal will be to try to ethnically cleanse the West Bank and force people to join them. "" ""If they fail to ethnically cleanse all Gazans, I am sure that Netanyahu's plan B is to annexe Gaza City and the north of Gaza completely to Israel and claim it as a security area. "" Barghouthi warns that Israel faces dire prospects if its troops stay in Gaza long term. ""Israel did that before and it didn't work. And there will be resistance to their occupation, which they cannot tolerate. And that's why Netanyahu's goal really is to ethnically cleanse people. He wants to have military control of Gaza without people. He knows very well that Gaza with people is something that is unmanageable. ""  Barghouthi believes Gaza should be part of a democratic Palestinian state. ""We Palestinians are grown up people. We don't need any patronage of anybody. And no, we don't need any other country to tell us how we should rule ourselves. "" This crisis looks as if it will have more chapters. The US veto of the latest ceasefire resolution at the UN Security Council gives Israel more time to wage war. But that extra time is not indefinite, and continued Biden support for Israel carries a political price in America's coming election year. Influential members of his own Democratic party oppose what he's doing, and so do younger voters whose support he needs. The Biden Administration is already deeply uncomfortable that Israel is ignoring its repeated requests to protect civilians and respect the laws of war.  Israel may struggle to achieve the crushing victory Benjamin Netanyahu has promised. He set a high bar for victory; not just annihilating Hamas as a military force, but also destroying its capacity to govern. Israel's vast military power, reinforced by American resupply, has not yet destroyed the capacity of Hamas to fight. The Hamas creed of Islamist nationalism is also embedded in the minds of many Palestinians. Guns often don't kill ideas but reinforce them.  The future is messy and dangerous. The war in Gaza will not end neatly. ",The status quo is smashed. The future is messy and dangerous,Israel-Gaza: The status quo is smashed.

1809,2023-12-04 18:42:09+00:00,/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-67613877,"Tributes have been paid to a former University of Glasgow student who has died in Gaza. Dima Alhaj was killed last month alongside her six-month-old baby, her husband and her two brothers. Roseann Maguire, who hosted Ms Alhaj in Glasgow for two months, remembered her as a ""lovely young woman"". Ms Alhaj was working for the World Health Organisation (WHO), who announced the news of her death on social media.  Dozens of her family members were also killed in the explosion, believed to have been caused by an airstrike. The 29-year-old had studied in Glasgow as part of the Erasmus programme, before returning to Gaza where she worked with the WHO Trauma and Emergency Team. Ms Maguire recalled that the former student had always planned to return home to Gaza after her studies. She said: ""Dima was very concerned about the situation of people in Gaza, and she wanted to go back and help in some way. That was the kind of young woman she was. ""   Ms Alhaj stayed with Ms Maguire and Gerry O'Hare in their Glasgow home after her initial accommodation plans fell through. Ms Maguire recalled: ""She really enjoyed the freedom of Glasgow. . . She called us her second family. "" The three remained in touch after Ms Alhaj returned to Gaza. Mr O'Hare became friends with her father, a doctor in the area.    Ms Maguire last heard from Ms Alhaj on 13 November, just over a week before she was killed. She said: ""The messages started saying 'this is terrible', and then got shorter [as time went on]. They were just saying 'I'm alive. Pray for me. '""  The last message sent to Ms Maguire stated: ""No words to express. Please pray for us. This is Abood, my little boy. I hope he lives to see better days. "" Mr O'Hare, who once visited the Alhaj family in Gaza, added: ""This was a family house, they showed me round the fruit trees. For the life of me I can't understand why a family home, detached, would be the subject of a massive bomb attack. "" More than 100 University of Glasgow students and members of the public attended a candlelight vigil held in Ms Alhaj's memory last week. Officials in Gaza say more than 14,800 people including about 6,000 children have been killed since Israel began its military campaign against Hamas there, with thousands more believed to be dead under rubble. It follows Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October during which it killed about 1,200 people and kidnapped 240 others. Israel's bombardment of Gaza has now resumed after a temporary ceasefire ended on Friday.

The Liberal Democrat says her family are ""days away from dying"" without access to water or food. The Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem say a mother and daughter were killed inside the Holy Family Church complex on Saturday by sniper fire. The IDF said it found no evidence to show the incident took place. In a statement, the Israel Defense Forces said: ""During the dialogue between the IDF and representatives of the community, no reports of a hit on the church, nor civilians being injured or killed, were raised. ""A review of the IDF's operational findings support this. "" The Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem said two Christian women - named as Nahida and her daughter Samar - were shot and killed while walking to a building in the church complex known as the Sister's Convent.  ""One was killed as she tried to carry the other to safety,"" a statement said. Seven more people were shot and wounded as they ""tried to protect others inside the church compound"" on Saturday.  The patriarchate said no warning had been given and added: ""They were shot in cold blood inside the premises of the parish, where there are no belligerents. "" The patriarchate said that earlier on Saturday an Israeli tank fired on part of the church compound with 54 disabled people inside. It caused a fire that destroyed the building's generator, the only source of electricity, and some of the disabled people can no longer use their respirators, the statement said. Members of Ms Moran's extended family - a grandmother, her son, his wife and their 11-year-old twins - are Christian Palestinians who sought refuge inside the church after their home was bombed in the first week of the war. They have been staying on mattresses along with dozens of others in rooms in the Holy Family Church for more than 60 days. ""I'm now no longer sure they are going to survive until Christmas,"" Ms Moran told the BBC. They have been keeping in touch with Ms Moran and other family members sporadically through WhatsApp messages and calls - though they have no internet and power is intermittent.  A sixth member of the family - a grandfather - died last month after not being able to get to hospital to receive medical treatment, Ms Moran says. The five remaining members say they now no longer have access to food or water, and the last remaining generator - which was pumping water from wherever they could get it - has stopped working in the church. They say soldiers entered the church compound in the last 24 hours and took over a room in a building.  Earlier in the week, the family heard shots being fired and saw bullet casings in the church compound. They say two men were killed on Tuesday while they were coming and going from the building - a bin collector and a janitor.  The family have sent a photo, seen by the BBC, of two bodies lying on a street outside the church building. Ms Moran's relatives say the bodies have been decaying outside for days. The BBC has not verified the circumstances of what the image shows. Ms Moran says there has been no explanation as to why Israeli soldiers would target the church and no warnings or leaflets were sent to people sheltering there. ""It does feel like it's making a mockery of keeping civilians safe,"" Ms Moran adds. Israel says it is carrying out military operations in Gaza to ""eradicate"" Hamas and rescue hostages taken by the group. Early on in the war Israel told people in northern Gaza to move to southern Gaza for their safety. It has also paused military activity in some areas for short periods to allow people to leave. There was also a temporary ceasefire between Israel and Hamas to allow a swap of some Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners. However Israel has also bombed southern Gaza, where it told people to go, and a large number of Palestinians have remained in Gaza City and other northern areas. Ms Moran says she has been in touch with a number of countries about getting her relatives out of Gaza, but the situation is ""incredibly complex"". She adds that the family have considered trying to travel to Rafah in southern Gaza near the border with Egypt but say it is too dangerous while no ceasefire is in place. Hamas broke through Israel's heavily guarded perimeter on 7 October, killing 1,200 people and taking 240 hostages - some of whom were released during the brief truce.

1814,2023-12-20 01:28:20+00:00,/news/world-middle-east-67765866,"Last-minute negotiations have delayed a UN vote on a draft resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.  Wrangles over the wording of the Security Council resolution, reportedly to avoid another veto by the US, mean the vote has moved to Wednesday.  Increased pressure for a suspension of fighting between Israel and Hamas comes as the leader of Hamas is expected to travel to Egypt for talks.  Ismail Haniyeh is due in Cairo later on Wednesday, a source told the BBC.  Egypt, alongside Qatar, helped broker a truce last month that led to a week-long ceasefire and the release of some 100 hostages captured by Hamas in exchange for hundreds of Palestinians being held in Israeli jails. Israeli leaders have rejected a new ceasefire since then, saying it would only benefit Hamas. But on Tuesday Israeli President Isaac Herzog said the country was ready for another pause in the fighting to enable more hostages to be released. Hamas official Osama Hamdan told a news conference in Beirut on Monday that the group was ""open to any initiative aiming for a ceasefire"", but he insisted there would be ""no negotiations on a hostage swap deal until the Zionist [Israeli] aggression completely stops"". The original draft Security Council resolution proposed by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) called for an ""urgent and sustainable cessation of hostilities"" to allow ""safe and unhindered humanitarian access"". Initially diplomats thought they were very close to an agreement, 99% of the way there, but the final discussions have been complex, according to the UAE. The US says it is engaging constructively with other members to resolve outstanding issues.  Late on Tuesday, the US Deputy Ambassador to the UN, Robert Wood, was asked by the BBC whether the US supported the draft resolution and he said: ""We're still working on the text with other players and I don't want to get ahead of where we are at this point. So let's just see how the discussions go this afternoon. ""  Diplomats say the main sticking points are how to frame calls for a cessation of hostilities and the proposal for a UN mechanism to inspect aid going into Gaza.  The US, along with Israel, opposes a ceasefire because they say it would benefit Hamas. Washington vetoed a previous Security Council resolution demanding one. The UK abstained, but every other member supported it. And Israel, according to one Security Council diplomat, is pressuring the US to veto this resolution as well, out of fear that a UN mechanism to monitor aid would prevent them from controlling deliveries in Gaza.  When US state department spokesperson Matt Miller was asked whether Israel had asked the US to veto it, he said they had been in discussions with their ally, as well as other countries in the region, and they would ultimately make their own determination about what the best course of action was depending on what the final resolution stated.  The current draft has already been watered down and now calls for a suspension of hostilities, rather than a sustainable cessation of hostilities, but it still includes a phrase calling for ""urgent steps"" towards a sustainable cessation of hostilities.  The UAE's Ambassador to the UN, Lana Nusseibeh, said the priority and focus of the resolution were to have a real impact on the ground with a scaling-up of access, the opening of all land, sea and air crossing points, and ensuring Egypt has the support it needed from the UN in the form of a mechanism to streamline the process of monitoring aid.  But overriding all of that, she said, was ensuring that humanitarian workers could deliver aid safely and were protected by the normal rules of de-confliction.  But the Israeli government is under growing international pressure to agree to a ceasefire because of the mounting civilian casualties in Gaza.  It is also facing pressure at home for a deal that would see more hostages freed, after Israeli soldiers mistakenly killed three Israeli men who had been held captive in Gaza last week. Gaza has been devastated by the war, which was triggered by an unprecedented cross-border attack by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October, in which at least 1,200 people were killed - most of them civilians - and about 240 taken hostage. Since then, more than 19,600 people have been killed in Gaza, about 70% of them women and children, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. It reported that about 100 Palestinians had been killed in Israeli air strikes on Tuesday.  Ahead of the Security Council meeting, UN aid workers in Geneva could not hide their despair at the failure of the international community to put an end to the conflict and tackle the rapidly deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza. Unicef spokesman James Elder, who recently returned from the territory, told reporters that ""every single child is enduring these 10 weeks of hell and not one of them can escape"". He lamented that ""not even lip service"" had been paid to requirements, under international law, to safeguard medical facilities, food and water.  Only eight of Gaza's 36 hospitals are still partially functioning, according to the World Health Organization.

On Tuesday, 153 member states in the 193-strong assembly voted in favour and 10 including the US and Israel against, with 23 abstentions. Palestinian representative Riyad Mansour said it was a ""historic day"". Israel's envoy Gilad Erdan said before the vote that a ""ceasefire only serves to prolong Hamas's reign of terror"". Senior Hamas official Bassem Naeem told the BBC that the passing of the resolution confirmed that ""the prevailing international will is in favour of stopping the aggression against the Palestinian people"". Although the US voted against the resolution, US President Joe Biden had earlier warned that Israel was losing international support because of ""indiscriminate bombing"" of Palestinians.  He also expressed disagreement over plans for the future of the Gaza Strip, saying the Israeli government appeared opposed a two-state solution with the Palestinians. Tuesday's vote was the second attempt by the General Assembly to stop hostilities. In October, it had called for ""a humanitarian truce"" in a resolution adopted with 121 votes in favour, 14 against and 44 abstentions. Although non-binding, such resolutions are seen as a powerful measure of international opinion, analysts say. UN Secretary General António Guterres has long been pushing for a humanitarian ceasefire to prevent a ""complete breakdown of public order"" in Gaza. Last Friday, the UN Security Council - the body tasked with global peace and security issues - failed to adopt a draft resolution calling for a truce in Gaza. The US - one of the council's five veto-wielding council members - blocked the move.  Israel has been carrying out air strikes and a ground offensive in the Gaza Strip after a Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October in which Israeli officials say 1,200 were killed and another 240 taken hostage. Some of the abductees were later released during a brief truce.  The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says Israel has killed more than 18,200 people and injured at least 50,000, including many women and children, during its ongoing military operation.",UN General Assembly demands immediate Gaza ceasefire,Israel Gaza: UN General Assembly demands immediate ceasefire,"israel,israel-gaza_war,hamas",http://bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-67699508,articles/article_1815.txt,results/article_1815.txt.json
1816,2023-12-15 21:11:30+00:00,/news/world-middle-east-67732347,"The ""dehumanising"" treatment of paramedics, ambulances shot at, and unexploded bombs on the road. Jake Morland, a British aid worker with the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), has given the BBC his eyewitness account of a high-risk mission to transfer patients under appalling conditions in Gaza. Last Saturday, 9 December, a joint World Health Organisation (WHO)/UN/Palestine Red Crescent Society convoy of six ambulances and a truck set off from southern Gaza to deliver desperately-needed medical supplies to the al-Ahli Hospital in the north, and to transfer critically-injured patients from there to a hospital in the south. To get to al-Ahli, the convoy had to pass through the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) checkpoint at Wadi Gaza. ""The one thing we expect when we go through a checkpoint in any military setting is free access for humanitarian personnel and goods"", says Mr Morland, who has been a UN aid worker for 20 years. But this time, he says, ""we approached huge sand dunes with Israeli soldiers standing on the top with their machine guns squarely aimed at the Palestinian paramedics, at the UN vehicles, and at the UN trucks carrying medical supplies"". As they were held there for over an hour, two of the Palestinian paramedics were led away for questioning. ""We understand one was put on his knees, stripped and detained for some time until we were able to negotiate his release and carry on to Gaza,"" says Mr Morland. ""These moves (of aid) are clearly co-ordinated with the IDF,"" he says. ""We provide all the details of what's on the convoy, what it's going to do, and indeed the names of all the members of the convoy… So what was really a dehumanising treatment of Palestinian colleagues was unacceptable. "" From Wadi Gaza, the aid convoy pressed on north into the old city of Gaza, which Mr Morland describes as a rabbit warren of debris-strewn streets - with unexploded ordnance on the road and beside it. ""We were also shot at. The ambulance took a couple of bullets as indeed did a truck. So it really was putting humanitarian workers' lives on the line as they went to try and save lives. "" On the return journey south, they were again held up at the checkpoint - but this time they were carrying 19 critically injured patients from a tiny trauma hospital in Gaza City, so every minute counted. ""All of these patients had life-critical injuries - amputations; horrific wounds that needed immediate attention. We were held for over two hours at the checkpoint. The walking wounded were forced at gunpoint from the ambulance and again were stood in the sand to be profiled by the IDF,"" Mr Morland recalls.  ""Even the children who were wounded and terrified were carried out by the paramedics, and stood there for over an hour while pictures were taken. ""  Eventually, as night fell and the sound of air strikes grew closer, the group had to take a difficult decision: to leave behind one of the paramedics who was still detained by the IDF. ""We had patients who were literally dying because of all the delays that were being imposed on us,"" says Mr Morland. ""I heard that one of the patients died from his injuries on the way to a hospital in the south. We think that may have been avoidable if we'd been allowed free and fair access through the checkpoint. ""  We put these allegations to the IDF, who told us that one of the Palestinian paramedics was detained because he was suspected of ""association with terror activities"". The IDF said they encouraged the rest of the convoy to move on south, but that of the six ambulances containing injured patients, three opted to remain with the suspect despite being encouraged to move to the southern hospital.  Regarding the patient who reportedly died, the IDF said this was only reported to them days later and they have yet to be able to independently confirm it. For Jake Morland though, it was not just the hardship of getting a medical convoy through IDF lines that shocked him - it was what he witnessed in Gaza's al-Ahli Hospital that day. ""This is a hospital that normally treats 80 patients with 80 beds,"" he says. ""There are currently over 200 patients in that hospital. ""They're no longer dealing with broken bones. They're now dealing with life-threatening wounds; horrific, shrapnel wounds.  ""I've never seen so many people dying in front of me. They were lying on stretchers with horrific wounds next to body bags. The scenes were horrific. And yet these Palestinian paramedics and the other aid workers that go there (to northern Gaza) time and time again - at great risk to themselves - act with compassion and dignity, and help these patients, and try to bring them to safety"".  Asked what the wounds were caused by, Mr Morland says: ""They are just praying for the bombs to stop raining down on them in Gaza City, and they are all wounds and injuries of war. Pure and simple.

In an email seen by the BBC, Ross Stevens said he was ""appalled"" Elizabeth Magill avoided questions about how students calling for the genocide of Jews would be punished. Ms Magill was grilled by politicians on Tuesday about antisemitism on campus. She has since apologised for her remarks, but is facing calls to resign. US media are reporting the advisory board at Wharton - the university's business school - has written a letter to Ms Magill calling for her to step down ""with immediate effect"".   American college campuses have seen angry protests and rising incidents of antisemitism since the war between Israel and Hamas erupted two months ago.  Ms Magill appeared in the House of Representatives alongside the presidents of Harvard and MIT, Claudine Gay and Sally Kornbluth. They were asked by Republican New York Congresswoman Elise Stefanik: ""Does calling for the genocide of Jews violate [your university's] code of conduct or rules regarding bullying and harassment? Yes or no?""  Ms Magill and her MIT and Harvard counterparts did not reply yes or no but said - in varying ways - that it depended on the ""context"".  There has been a widespread backlash since, with the White House condemning the remarks. ""The lack of moral clarity is unacceptable,"" Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, the highest-ranking Jewish member of the administration, said on Thursday at a ceremony to mark the lighting of the national menorah. In his message about the withdrawal of the donation, Mr Stevens said: ""I have clear grounds to rescind Penn's $100 million of Stone Ridge shares due to the conduct of President Magill. ""  The founder and CEO of Stone Ridge Asset Management, he told the university that its ""permissive approach"" to those calling for violence against Jewish people ""would violate any policies or rules that prohibit harassment and discrimination based on religion, including those of Stone Ridge"". Penn is one of the oldest universities in the US and a part of the elite Ivy League group, which also has Harvard, Columbia and Yale as members.  Wharton counts former US President Donald Trump, Tesla and SpaceX billionaire Elon Musk, and many other powerful names in business and finance among its graduates.  The donation, in the form of limited partnership units in Stone Ridge, was gifted by Mr Stevens in 2017 to help Wharton create a finance innovation centre.  Ms Magill in particular has faced mounting scrutiny as to whether she can continue in her position.  She released a video on the university's website on Wednesday apologising for her response during the hearing, saying that she was focused on the ""university's long-standing policies - aligned with the US Constitution - which say that speech alone is not punishable"". She added she should have been focused on the ""irrefutable fact that a call for genocide of Jewish people is a call for some of the most terrible violence human beings can perpetrate"", adding that it is ""evil, plain and simple"".  While her apology on Wednesday was welcomed by some, Mr Stevens' letter appeared to call for her resignation.   He said Stone Ridge would welcome the opportunity to review its decision ""if, and when, there is a new University President in place"". On Wednesday, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro - a non-voting trustee at UPenn - criticised Ms Magill for her ""absolutely shameful"" remarks and called on the university to make a ""serious decision"" on her continued leadership. ""It should not be hard to condemn genocide,"" he said. ""Leaders have a responsibility to speak and act with moral clarity, and Liz Magill failed to meet that simple test. "" A petition demanding Ms Magill's resignation had gathered more than 23,000 signatures as of Friday afternoon. Facing criticism over her own remarks at Tuesday's hearing, Harvard President Dr Gay apologised in an interview with the college newspaper, saying she ""got caught up in what had become at that point, an extended, combative exchange about policies and procedures"". The House Committee on Education and the Workforce announced on Thursday that they will formally investigate Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology over ""rampant antisemitism"". ""Committee members have deep concerns with their leadership and their failure to take steps to provide Jewish students the safe learning environment they are due under law,"" the committee's chairwoman Virginia Foxx said in a statement.  Two University of Pennsylvania students - both of whom are Jewish - filed a lawsuit against the school on Thursday, claiming it has become ""an incubation lab for virulent anti-Jewish hatred, harassment and discrimination. "" The lawsuit also accuses the school of ""selectively"" enforcing rules of conduct ""to avoid protecting Jewish students"" and hiring ""rabidly antisemitic professors who call for anti-Jewish violence"".

1822,2023-12-05 22:47:42+00:00,/news/world-us-canada-67631859,"The heads of three top US colleges have pushed back against claims that they are not doing enough to combat antisemitism on their campuses. The leaders, who included Harvard president Claudine Gay, testified before the House of Representatives. The students at the universities have accused administrators of not protecting Jewish people since the start of the Israel-Hamas war.  Jewish students said they faced antisemitic threats, assault and more. In testimony to the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, Professor Gay acknowledged a rising tide of antisemitism and Islamophobia on campus since 7 October, when Hamas attacked Israel, which responded with a bombardment of Gaza and ground offensive. She said it has been a challenge to balance freedom of speech and protest on campus while also protecting students against hate.  ""This is difficult work. And I know that I have not always gotten it right,"" Prof Gay said. She testified alongside two other presidents of elite American colleges: University of Pennsylvania president Liz Magill and Massachusetts Institute of Technology president Sally Kornbluth. They were called to testify before Congress by Virginia Foxx, the Republican chairwoman of the committee, after some House members accused the universities of ""mishandling antisemitic, violent"" protests on their campuses.  The US Department of Education said in November it had opened an investigation into antisemitism allegations at Harvard. Similar inquiries have been opened recently at other colleges as well. Prof Gay told lawmakers her campus had taken steps to combat antisemitism recently. She noted they had beefed up security, denounced Hamas' attack and reiterated that the school will not tolerate ""speech that incites violence, threatens safety, or violates Harvard's policies"".  Ms Foxx said these efforts were not enough and accused college administrators of standing by and ""allowing horrific rhetoric to fester and grow"" during the conflict in the Gaza Strip. US college students have held frequent pro-Palestinian and pro-Israel demonstrations on college campuses since the start of the war, and some incidents at the protests have raised allegations of antisemitism. Pro-Palestinian rally organisers on college campuses have regularly denied this. They claim they are only calling for an end to violence and Israel's occupation of Palestinian territory. But a recent survey by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) and Hillel International, both Jewish advocacy groups, found that nearly 75% of Jewish college students have experienced some form of antisemitism this school year.  Before the presidents' testimonies, several Jewish students appeared at a press conference hosted by House Republicans to share their own experiences of such discrimination. Eyal Yakoby, a student at the University of Pennsylvania, described incidents in which Jewish groups received threatening and antisemitic emails, and another in which a swastika was spray painted in an academic building. ""Why doesn't the university hold the perpetrators of such acts accountable?"" said Mr Yakoby, who told reporters that Jewish students felt unsafe on campus.  Some Muslim and pro-Palestinian students at Harvard, meanwhile, have been doxxed since the start of the war. They have had their names and photographs published under the headline ""Harvard's Leading Antisemites"".  The Council on American-Islamic Relations has also reported a sharp rise in complaints of bias incidents against Muslim people in the US since the war began.  On Tuesday, the Republican-majority House also passed a resolution to condemn the ""drastic rise of antisemitism"" in the US and around the world following 7 October.  The resolution also stated that ""anti-Zionism is antisemitism"".  Some Jewish Democrats in the House, including New York congressmen Jerry Nadler and Dan Goldman, said the resolution was an ""unserious attempt by Republicans to weaponize Jewish pain"".  It passed with every Republican vote except one. Thirteen Democrats voted against the resolution, while others voted ""present"".

1823,2023-12-05 23:12:10+00:00,/news/world-us-canada-67631739,"The US has announced a visa ban on extremists responsible for violence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.  Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he was taking action to target attacks by Israeli settlers on Palestinians.  But the top diplomat said the ban would also apply to Palestinians accused of violence.  Attacks have surged in the West Bank since the start of the war in the Gaza Strip, triggered by Hamas's assault on southern Israel on 7 October. US state department spokesman Matthew Miller said the ban would affect ""dozens"" of extremist Israelis and some of their family members. He said that laws forbid the US from naming those targeted. The move marks the latest expression of frustration from Washington at the Israeli government's position towards settlers. Senior far-right ministers Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich - both settlers themselves - have previously been accused of seeking to downplay violence in the West Bank.  And in recent weeks Palestinians in the West Bank have told BBC News that Israeli settlers are using the war in Gaza as an opportunity to seize land. More than 700,000 Jewish people live in more than 250 settlements built since Israel's occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war. The vast majority of the international community considers the settlements illegal under international law, though Israel and the US dispute this interpretation. The UN says it has recorded 314 settler attacks against Palestinians since 7 October, resulting in Palestinian casualties or damage to Palestinian-owned property. Four Israelis, including three security forces personnel, have been killed in attacks by Palestinians in the West Bank over the same period.  ""We have underscored to the Israeli government the need to do more to hold accountable extremist settlers who have committed violent attacks against Palestinians in the West Bank,"" Mr Blinken said in a statement on Tuesday. ""As President Biden has repeatedly said, those attacks are unacceptable. "" The decision comes just over a month after Israel was accepted into the US Visa Waiver Program, which allows Israeli citizens visa-free travel to the US.  Individuals targeted by Tuesday's announcement will not be eligible for the programme, according to the Associated Press news agency, and current US visa holders will have their travel passes revoked.  American passport holders are not affected by the new policy. Reacting to the US decision, Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant told reporters: ""There is, sadly, violence from extremists that we must condemn. "" ""In a state of law, and Israel is a state of law, the right to use violence belongs only to those who are certified to do so by the government,"" he said, according to Reuters.",US sanctions extremists over West Bank attacks,US sanctions individuals implicated in West Bank attacks,"israel,palestinian_territories,israel_and_the_palestinians,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-67631739,articles/article_1823.txt,results/article_1823.txt.json

It said the USS Carney assisted the ships - which had links to 14 nations including the UK - on Sunday after they were targeted from areas of Yemen held by Iran-backed Houthi rebels. Two of the ships were hit by missiles but there were no casualties, it added.  A Houthi spokesman said the group's navy had attacked two Israeli ships. The Israeli military said the vessels had no connection to Israel. The Iranian-backed Houthis have controlled parts of Yemen since the movement toppled the country's government in 2014, sparking an ongoing civil war. It has recently begun targeting Israel-linked vessels in the Red Sea over Israel's war with Iranian-backed Hamas in Gaza. US Central Command (Centcom), part of the US military which oversees operations in the Middle East, said that on Sunday morning, the USS Carney detected an anti-ship ballistic missile exploding near the Unity Explorer, a Bahamian-flagged, UK-owned and operated cargo ship. It later shot down a drone that was heading towards the Carney itself, although Centcom said it was not clear whether the drone was targeting the Carney.  That afternoon, the Unity Explorer suffered minor damage after being struck by a missile fired from Houthi-controlled area.  While responding to a distress call from the ship, the US vessel detected and shot down another incoming drone.  Later, two more ships - one of them part UK-owned, both of them flagged in Panama - reported being struck by missiles. While on its way to assist the second ship, the USS Carney shot down a third drone.  Centcom said the attacks had ""jeopardised the lives"" of the ships' multinational crews and represented a ""direct threat to international commerce and maritime security"". ""We also have every reason to believe that these attacks, while launched by the Houthis in Yemen, are fully enabled by Iran,"" it said.  ""The United States will consider all appropriate responses in full coordination with its international allies and partners. "" Earlier this week, the US said its warship captured armed men who had earlier seized an Israeli-linked tanker off Yemen's coast. Centcom reported that two missiles were then fired towards the warship from rebel Houthi-controlled territory in Yemen. The Houthis have declared themselves part of an ""axis of resistance"" of Iran-affiliated groups, which works in opposition to Israel, the US, and the wider West.

Mr Austin, who spoke after a meeting with his Israeli counterpart in Tel Aviv, reiterated US support for the offensive against Hamas. He said Washington would provide more arms, vehicles and munitions to Israel. US officials have been steadfast in their support of Israel since the 7 October attacks by Hamas. But President Joe Biden has been under growing pressure, including from within his own Democratic Party, to rein in their military campaign. Speaking on Monday, Mr Austin said the US would not ""dictate timelines or terms"" of the war to its ally. ""Our support to Israel's right to defend itself is ironclad. . . and that's not going to change,"" he said. ""It's critical. . . that Hamas not be able to threaten Israel from Gaza or even threaten Gaza anymore. "" Mr Austin then said he had discussed the objectives of the military campaign and ""how to reduce harm to civilians in the battlespace"" with his Israeli counterpart Yoav Gallant ""We also have some great thoughts about how to transition from high intensity operations to a lower intensity and more surgical operations,"" he said. Mr Gallant, meanwhile, said Israeli forces would ""continue to operate in Gaza with different levels of intensity"". While Mr Austin has been advising Israel to temper and target its operations since its military campaign began, he has become more outspoken as civilian deaths have increased. He earlier warned that Israel risked replacing a tactical victory with a strategic defeat. The health ministry in Gaza, which is run by Hamas, says more than 19,400 people have been killed and 52,000 injured in the enclave since the start of the war. Mr Austin said that he had held discussions with Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, about how to reduce civilian casualties and collateral damage as the operation continues.  His remarks align with the US government's recent approach to the war, with officials urging Israel to ""put a premium on human life"" and give clearer instructions to allow people to avoid the conflict. Senior US officials have also displayed increasing discontent at Israel's military response. Last week, Mr Biden said Israel was starting to lose global support over what he called its ""indiscriminate bombing"" of Gaza. But he reiterated that Israel could rely on US support and stressed that he supported its right to defend itself. Concern has mounted over the rising civilian cost of Israeli military operations in the Hamas-run territory, which began after Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October left around 1,200 Israelis dead.  A Human Rights Watch report released on Monday accused Israel of ""using starvation of civilians as a method of warfare in the Gaza Strip, which is a war crime"".

1826,2023-12-07 07:50:23+00:00,/news/world-us-canada-67637679,"Senate Republicans have blocked a move to pass an aid bill for Ukraine after failing to secure border compromises they sought in exchange.  The $110bn (£87.3bn) package included $61bn for Ukraine, as well as funds for Israel and aid for Gaza. The White House has warned that US funds for Ukraine could soon run out. A Ukrainian official said that failure to secure more US aid would mean a ""very high possibility"" that the war will be lost to Russia. While Republican members are generally in favour of aid to Ukraine, some have sought to use the issue as a way to address mounting domestic concerns over the US southern border. Senators - including every single Republican - voted 51 to 49 against advancing the bill, with 60 votes needed. The vote throws uncertainty into the future of aid for Ukraine and sends lawmakers back to the negotiating table just days before Congress has scheduled its winter break.  Republicans are insisting that any aid to Ukraine be tied to sweeping US immigration and asylum reforms. Earlier on Wednesday, US President Joe Biden said he was ""willing to make significant compromises on the border"" in order to get the aid bill passed.  ""This cannot wait,"" he said, adding that ""Republicans in Congress are willing to give Putin the greatest gift he could hope for"". Also on Wednesday, the Biden administration announced $175m in new security assistance for Ukraine from the supply of funding that has already been approved. The package includes ammunition, including missiles and artillery shells, as well as ""equipment to protect critical national infrastructure"", the US Department of Defense said in a news release. Concerns over the future of the $110bn package grew on Tuesday after a classified briefing for lawmakers aimed at shoring up support for new funds broke down spectacularly.  Senators shouted at each other over border security and at least a dozen Republicans walked out.  Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also cancelled a virtual briefing with lawmakers over a ""last-minute matter"", Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Tuesday, without providing further detail. The package already includes provisions for border security, but Republican demands for additional changes to asylum rules has complicated negotiations with Democrats.  Ahead of the failed vote to bring the package to the floor, Mr Schumer delivered an emotional plea to his colleagues on the Senate floor, telling them that the vote was an important ""moment in history"" and that they should ""rush to the defence of democracy"" in Ukraine.  ""You can be sure that Vladimir Putin is watching closely,"" he said.  On Tuesday, the head of Ukraine's presidential office, Andriy Yermak, told an audience at the US Institute of Peace that a failure to secure more US aid would mean a ""very high possibility"" that the war will be lost and that it will be ""impossible to continue to liberate"" Russian-held areas.  In Ukraine, dimming prospects for additional aid have led to a darkening mood among some parts of the population.  ""Of course we need support, we are protecting the whole of Europe,"" Tetyana, a Kyiv resident whose son is on the frontline, told the BBC this week. ""We need more weapons because our children are dying. "" The Senate bill needed nine Republican votes to advance - a threshold that was ultimately too high. Some Democrats expressed frustration at their Republican colleagues.  ""The Ukrainians are on the frontlines fighting for democracy,"" Massachusetts Democrat Elizabeth Warren told reporters. ""This is about freedom"".  Several Senators said that while more negotiations would follow, it is unclear whether any progress can be achieved before Congress breaks for the holidays next week.  Mr Schumer, for his part, said ""we'll see"" when asked whether he believed Senators could come to an agreement before the break, even though he believed Mr Biden had presented a ""good strong plan"".  One of the Republicans who opposed the package, South Carolina's Lindsey Graham, said he did not believe any solution would be possible in that timeframe.  Mr Graham added that he believed Mr Biden would ultimately need to negotiate more, saying that ""it's going to take his leadership or we are stuck. ""  ""They know what we want,"" he said. ""I'm hopeful we can get the border part in a place where we can go for a bill. ""  Even if it had passed in the Senate, the package still would have faced an uphill battle in the House of Representatives.  House Speaker Mike Johnson said on Tuesday that he has told the Senate he cannot pass any Ukraine aid without the inclusion of significant border security measures.  Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, Congress has approved over $110bn in military and economic aid to Ukraine, most of which has already been distributed.  In a letter to Mr Johnson released publicly earlier this week, White House budget director Shalanda Young said that the US would be unable to get more weapons and equipment to Ukraine ""by the end of the year"" without Congressional action. Ukrainian officials have repeatedly stressed that they see US aid as vital to the ability of the country's forces to resist the Russians and re-take occupied territory.   Another senator to vote against the aid bill was independent Senator Bernie Sanders, who had earlier in the day expressed reservations that the legislation included billions in military aid for Israel.  ""I do not believe we should be appropriating over $10 billion for the right-wing extremist Netanyahu government to continue its current military approach,"" Mr Sanders said, referring to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's ongoing campaign in the Gaza strip, which has so far killed thousands of civilians.  Mr Sanders, who is a long-time critic of Mr Netanyahu, added: ""What the Netanyahu government is doing is immoral, it is in violation of international law, and the United States should not be complicit in those actions.

Initially, two videos of what appeared to be the same scene - a man in his underwear obeying instructions to lay down a weapon - but with slight differences, sparked speculation it may have been filmed repeatedly for separate ""takes"". BBC Verify has examined the footage and established that both clips came from a continuous sequence in which three guns in total appear to be handed over. But questions remain about the exact circumstances and the release of the videos. Two separate clips depicting the same scene but with minor discrepancies circulated on social media on Saturday 9 December. This led to accusations that different ""takes"" had been filmed. Some pointed to how the man in the video was holding the gun in a different hand in the two scenes. BBC Verify has found that in fact these videos are different sections of a continuous sequence, not separate takes, and the same man is going to and fro bringing different guns to the pavement with their detached ammunition. In the footage, dozens of other men are seen standing across the road watching, also in their underwear, many of them with their arms aloft and holding identity cards. BBC Verify has established they are in front of a UN school in Beit Lahia, north of the Jabalia refugee camp. One video, which we know was shot first because of the position of the sun, shows the man placing a gun from his right hand on top of another on the pavement. In the next video, with the sun lower, the man places a different gun on top of those from his left hand. Still images corroborate and bookend this sequence, with one showing the very first gun being placed, and another showing the resulting three guns and magazines on the pavement.  There are still some questions raised by the footage. Notably, the man is being held at gunpoint and issued directions from off-screen, so it's unclear whether he is ""surrendering"" the weapons or just moving them as instructed. Given he is already in his underwear and he cannot have been concealing them on his person, it's unlikely Israeli troops did not know about these weapons, suggesting this may be performed for the camera, rather than as an act of authentic surrender. We also don't know if he, or any of the other individuals in the video, have any involvement with Hamas or the 7 October attack. In one of the videos, the end of what seems to be a DSLR zoom lens is briefly visible. There were also photographs circulating alongside the videos which were captured from a slightly different angle. This suggests the events were filmed or photographed by more than one person or camera. Over the past week, emotive images of Palestinians being detained in Gaza have provoked strong reactions - with some expressing concern over the treatment of the prisoners, and the Red Cross saying all detainees must be treated in accordance with international law. But Israel has been keen to show evidence it's making progress against Hamas in Gaza. On Sunday Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: ""In recent days, dozens of Hamas terrorists have surrendered to our forces. They are laying down their weapons and handing themselves over to our heroic fighters. ""It will take more time, the war is in full swing, but this is the beginning of the end for Hamas. "" The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) did not respond directly to questions about the circumstances of these videos but a spokesperson told the BBC that detained individuals ""are treated in accordance with international law"". ""It is often necessary for terror suspects to hand over their clothes such that their clothes can be searched and to ensure that they are not concealing explosive vests or other weaponry.

1828,2023-12-08 16:38:37+00:00,/news/world-middle-east-67659296,"With fighting raging around Khan Younis and in the north of Gaza, a video has emerged on social media showing dozens of Palestinian men detained by Israel. The footage, verified by the BBC, shows them stripped to their underwear, kneeling on the ground and being guarded by Israeli soldiers. The men are thought to have been arrested in Beit Lahia, in the far north of the Gaza strip. The BBC has been told some of the men have since been released. One of the men identified as having been detained is a well-known Palestinian journalist, leading his employers to accuse Israel of carrying out ""invasive searches and humiliating treatment"" of civilians.  Asked about the video, a spokesman for the Israeli government told the BBC the men detained were all of military age and had been ""discovered in areas that civilians were supposed to have evacuated weeks ago"". In the video, dozens of men are lined up on a pavement and appear to have been told to remove their shoes, which are scattered across the road. Israeli soldiers and armoured vehicles are standing guard over them.  Other images show them being transported in military trucks. In the Israeli media, the captives are being described as Hamas fighters who have surrendered. Another image -  which has not yet been verified by the BBC - shows men blindfolded, kneeling in what appears to be a large pit of bulldozed sand. The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) has not directly commented on the images, but spokesman Daniel Hagari said on Thursday that ""IDF fighters and Shin Bet officers detained and interrogated hundreds of terror suspects"".  ""Many of them also turned themselves in to our forces during the past 24 hours. The intelligence coming out of their interrogations is utilised to continue the fighting. "" On Friday, Israeli government spokesman Eylon Levy told the BBC the men had been detained in Jabalia and Shejaiya in northern Gaza, which he described as ""Hamas strongholds and centres of gravity"". ""We're talking about military age men who were discovered in areas that civilians were supposed to have evacuated weeks ago,"" he said. Mr Levy added that they would be questioned to ""work out who indeed was a Hamas terrorist and who is not"".  He emphasised the detained men had been found in areas where Israeli forces had engaged in ""close-quarter combat"" with Hamas. They had been ""deliberately disguising themselves as civilians"" and operating from civilian buildings.   The BBC has spoken to a man who says 10 of his cousins were part of the group detained by the Israeli army on Thursday in Beit Lahia.  The man - who wishes to remain anonymous over safety concerns - told BBC Arabic's Ethar Shalaby that IDF soldiers entered the area and used megaphones to order the men from their homes and UN relief agency (UNRWA) schools.  The IDF ordered women in the area to go to a nearby hospital and later threated to shoot them if the men did not come out of their homes, he said.  The man said seven of his cousins have since been released and have returned home, but added he does not know about the fate of the three who remain in Israeli detention. In a post on social media, the Palestinian ambassador to the UK described the footage as ""savage images of Israeli occupation forces detaining and stripping civilians taken from a UN shelter"". ""This evokes some of humanity's darkest passages of history,"" Husam Zomlot said. Palestinian journalist, Diaa al-Kahlout, a correspondent for al-Araby al-Jadeed, has been identified among those who were in the video of the detainees. The Arabic language news outlet, which also publishes in English under the name the New Arab, said Mr al-Kahlout had been arrested along with his brothers, relatives and ""other civilians"" by Israeli forces in Beit Lahia. Al-Araby al-Jadeed has condemned what it describes as the ""humiliating"" detention of Mr al-Kahlout on Thursday. It added that soldiers forced the men to remove their clothes and ""subjected them to invasive searches and humiliating treatment upon their arrest, prior to transporting them to undisclosed locations"". The outlet ""urges the international community, journalists' rights defenders and watchdogs, and human rights bodies to denounce this ongoing assault"" by Israel on journalists in the territory. A colleague of Mr al-Kahlout, Palestinian journalist Lamis Andoni, told Radio 4's PM programme on Friday that a number of prisoner had been released - but not Mr al-Kahlout. Ms Andoni said those freed told Mr Kahlout's family that he had been transferred to Zikim military base in Israel. The BBC has not verified this claim. ""We have no idea about his fate. The photos and videos of these men is horrifying. I'm shocked,"" she said, adding that her media outlet was liaising with Israeli forces via the UN.

1829,2023-12-06 16:18:37+00:00,/news/world-middle-east-67640750,"Families of people being held captive in Gaza say they have ""solid intelligence"" that the health of several hostages has deteriorated. Some are ""now in immediate danger"", the group of hostages' families said in a letter to Israel's war cabinet. Pressure has been growing on officials over the 138 people still being held by Hamas and other armed groups. Some of the freed hostages met Israel's leaders on Tuesday in a meeting that witnesses say turned rowdy. Israel has repeatedly pledged to do everything it can to rescue the remaining hostages. Some 110 hostages have been released in total - but a week-long truce under which dozens were freed ended last week and since then Israel has resumed its bombing of Gaza.  In a letter sent to the war cabinet, the Hostages Families HQ group said: ""We have received solid intelligence that there are abductees whose condition has deteriorated and are now in immediate danger. ""  They said at least one-third of the hostages were suffering from underlying illnesses and needed regular medical treatment - and going without such treatment was dangerous. Many abductees were also suffering from injuries from the 7 October attack - such as gunshot wounds or amputations - while some were tortured and abused, the group added. ""Based on this data, we demand that you act urgently, with initiative and creativity to obtain a deal for the immediate release of all the abductees - for them every additional day in captivity is a real danger to their lives,"" it said. It is thought the evidence they cite has come from the newly-released hostages, who on Tuesday evening held a meeting with Israel's prime minister and war cabinet and described what they saw during their captivity. Observers say the meeting turned tense and disorganised - with some accusing the government of putting politics before the wellbeing of their loved-ones. According to Israeli newspaper Haaretz, one former hostage - Israeli nurse Nili Margalit - told the meeting she had been looking after some of the elderly people being held captive, and that they suffered from heart disease, kidney failure and Parkinson's. ""They lie on mattresses all day long. I don't know how they manage since I left,"" she said. Another former hostage said she was scared by the bombing in Gaza, Haaretz reported. ""I see [Israeli] bombings there, and you have no idea where the captives are. I was in a house surrounded by explosions. We slept in tunnels, and we feared not Hamas, but Israel might kill us, and then it would have been said, 'Hamas killed you,'"" she said.  In an audio recording from the meeting, obtained by Israeli news site Ynet, another unnamed former hostage whose husband is still in captivity said she saw an 85-year-old Israeli man killed. ""I saw Aryeh Zalmanovich die in front of me,"" she said. ""And is that what you have to say, that you want to bring down the Hamas regime? That you want to show them who has bigger balls?"" Applause could be heard in the auditorium at the woman's outburst. In the recording, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu can be heard telling the families that there was ""no possibility right now of bringing everyone home"". Haaretz also quoted Mr Netanyahu as saying: ""We couldn't bring them all at once. If we could have done it, we would have. ""  He said that the reports of hostages' hearing Israel Defense Forces (IDF) bombings while in captivity ""pierces the heart. It not only pierces the heart, but as you'll surely understand, it also affects our operational considerations"". And he repeated Israel's pledge to rescue all hostages, saying: ""Our responsibility is to bring them all back. We'll fulfil this responsibility and bring them home. "" IDF spokesman Rear Adm Daniel Hagari repeated the pledge, saying: ""As the IDF expands its operations to dismantle Hamas in Gaza, we have not lost sight, not for one moment, of our critical mission to rescue our hostages, to do everything in our power to bring our hostages home.

1830,2023-12-19 15:45:11+00:00,/news/business-67759593,"Global supply chains could face severe disruption as a result of the world's biggest shipping companies diverting journeys away from the Red Sea. Attacks by Houthi rebels in Yemen on commercial vessels in recent weeks have resulted in many firms deciding to avoid one of the world's busiest shipping lanes. The Houthi group has declared its support for Hamas and has said it is targeting ships travelling to Israel, though it is not clear if all the ships that have been attacked were actually heading to Israel. The Houthis have been stepping up their attacks since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in October. The group, which is backed by Iran, has been using drones and rockets against foreign-owned vessels transporting goods through the strait of Bab al-Mandab - a 20-mile wide channel that splits Eritrea and Djibouti on the African side and Yemen on the Arabian Peninsula. Ships usually take this route from the south to reach Egypt's Suez Canal further north. But because of the attacks and the threat of future assaults, several of the world's largest shipping firms, including Mediterranean Shipping Company and Maersk, have diverted vessels away to a much longer route around Africa's Cape of Good Hope and then up the west side of the continent. BP has also paused all shipments of oil through the Red Sea, blaming the ""deteriorating security situation"". The longer journeys will add at least 10 days shipping times and cost companies millions of dollars. Any ship passing through the Suez Canal to or from the Indian Ocean has to come via the strait of Bab al-Mandab and the Red Sea.  The Suez Canal is the quickest sea route between Asia and Europe and is particularly important in the transportation of oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG). About nine million barrels of oil per day were shipped through the Suez Canal in the first half of 2023, according to freight analytics firm Vortexa. Analysts at S&P Global Market Intelligence said nearly 15% of goods imported into Europe, the Middle East and North Africa were shipped from Asia and the Gulf by sea. That includes 21.5% of refined oil and more than 13% of crude oil. But it is not just about oil. Container ships carry all sorts of consumer goods seen in the shops including TVs, clothes, trainers and sports equipment. It is inevitable that supply chains will be affected due to ships being diverted away from the Red Sea, but consumer goods ""will face the largest impact"", according to Chris Rogers, head of supply chain research at S&P Global Market Intelligence, though he does note the current disruption has occurred ""during the off-peak shipping season"". Delays to products reaching shops can be expected, with container ship journeys expected to take at least 10 days longer due to the Cape of Good Hope route adding about 3,500 nautical miles. The extra distance will also cost companies more. Shipping rates have risen 4% in the past week and those costs could be passed on by businesses to customers. However, rates still remain much lower than last year, and are far below the levels seen in 2021, when freight charges soared in line with demand as Covid restrictions were eased. There are also fears the disruption could push up oil prices. A rise in oil prices, a key ingredient in car fuel, can lead to higher prices at the pumps and also drive higher inflation. Inflation, which measures the pace of price rises, has been falling in the UK and is currently 4.6%. When it comes to shipments of LNG being disrupted, even if wholesale energy prices rise, any increases would not feed through to domestic bills until April 2024 at the earliest. This is because the energy price cap, which limits the amount suppliers can charge, has already been set for January.  Is moving freight by sea the only option? Mr Rogers says transporting goods by rail instead would require ""crossing Russia"", which is under economic sanctions due to invading Ukraine, while ""trucking from the Gulf to Israel may only offset around 3% of shipping"". The attacks have led the US to launch an international naval operation to protect ships in the Red Sea route, and countries including the UK, Canada, France, Bahrain, Norway and Spain have joined. US defence secretary Lloyd Austin held a virtual meeting with ministers from more than 40 countries on Tuesday, and called on more nations to contribute to efforts to keep shipping safe in the region. But some shipping companies are reluctant to immediately start using the route again despite increased security.  Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd, which have both have ships that have been attacked by Houthi rebels, welcomed the extra measures but said it is difficult to determine when they would go back to using the Red Sea, meaning there could be disruption for some time.",What do Red Sea assaults mean for global trade?,What do Red Sea assaults mean for global trade?,israel-gaza_war,http://bbc.co.uk/news/business-67759593,articles/article_1830.txt,results/article_1830.txt.json
1832,2023-12-13 16:59:10+00:00,/news/world-middle-east-67039975,"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing 1,200 people and taking about 240 hostages. The Israeli military responded with air strikes on Gaza, and launched a ground offensive. More than 18,600 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run government. During a temporary truce that lasted seven days, Hamas released 105 hostages and Israel freed 240 Palestinian prisoners in exchange. Israel Defense Forces (IDF) warplanes have been carrying out strikes across Gaza while its troops move through the territory. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel has a ""clear goal of destroying Hamas's military and governing capabilities"", as well as freeing the hostages. He also declared that Israel would have ""overall security responsibility"" for the Gaza Strip ""for an indefinite period"" after the conflict. However, Israel later said it has no plans to reoccupy the territory. Israel has drafted 300,000 reservists for the operation, to boost its standing force of 160,000. The IDF says it has struck thousands of targets belonging to Hamas - which Israel, the UK, US and other Western powers class as a terrorist organisation. It also says it has destroyed hundreds of tunnel shafts built underneath Gaza. Hamas has claimed that its tunnel network stretches for 500km (310 miles).  A number of hospitals in the north were caught up in intense fighting. Satellite images suggest that nearly 100,000 Gaza buildings may have been damaged during the fighting.  Since the ceasefire ended, Israeli troops have pushed into southern Gaza, and have taken ""aggressive"" action against Hamas and other armed groups in and around the city of Khan Younis.  Israel has also carried out many air strikes on Rafah, near the Egyptian border, where it has told residents of Khan Younis to flee. There continues to be fierce fighting in the north, around Jabalia refugee camp and the Shejaiya district of Gaza City. Hundreds of thousands of civilians are thought to remain in the north.  Israel claims to have killed thousands of Hamas fighters during the war, including many commanders.  The IDF says 115 Israeli soldiers have been killed since the start of the ground offensive on 27 October. In total, 444 soldiers have been killed since 7 October, the vast majority of them in Hamas's attacks that day.  During the 7 October attacks, Hamas took about 240 hostages. It says it hid them in ""safe places and tunnels"" within Gaza. According to Israel, more than 30 of the hostages were children, and at least 10 were aged over 60. It also said about half of the hostages had foreign passports from 25 different countries. Under a deal brokered by Qatar, a seven-day pause in fighting began on 24 November. During the truce, which ended on 1 December, 81 Israelis and dual nationals, along with 24 foreigners, were released. In return for the Israeli hostages, 240 Palestinians held in Israeli jails were freed. The released hostages included: Hamas released four Israeli hostages before the truce agreement, and another was freed by Israeli forces. The IDF has said 135 hostages are still being held by Hamas. Nineteen of them are presumed dead, according to Reuters news agency. Hamas has said other armed groups in Gaza are holding hostages, including Palestinian Islamic Jihad. This could complicate any future releases. On Tuesday, the UN General Assembly overwhelmingly supported a non-binding resolution demanding a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza. The US voted against the resolution. However, President Joe Bidencriticised Israel's ""indiscriminate bombing"" of Gaza. Mr Netanyahu has admitted that Israel has been ""not successful"" in minimising civilian casualties, but he has insisted this is because Hamas uses Gaza's civilian population as human shields. More than 50,000 people have been injured since the start of the war, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.  The World Health Organization (WHO) says only 11 out of Gaza's 36 hospitals are still partly functional and able to admit new patients. Only one of them is in the north. Food is scarce in Gaza and prices have soared, meaning many people are unable to afford staples such as flour. A lack of power makes cooking difficult.  Unrwa, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, has said that 1.9 million Gaza's residents - about 85% of the population - have been displaced and that 1.3 million of them have been sheltering in its facilities. This includes the hundreds of thousands of people who fled the fighting in the north after an Israeli order to move south of the Wadi Gaza river valley for their own safety. Unrwa warned that the 600,000 people in southern Gaza who have been ordered to leave their neighbourhoods because of the fighting have nowhere to go, since its own shelters are already beyond capacity.  Israel's military published an online map with Gaza split into more than 600 blocks, showing areas where people should evacuate for their own safety. But Unicef, the UN charity for children, warned that some of the ""safe"" zones are ""tiny patches of barren land"" with no water, sanitation or shelter.  Tens of thousands have fled to Rafah.  After the 7 October attacks, Israel shut its border crossings with Gaza, preventing the usual supplies of food, water, fuel and medicine from entering the territory.  Israel allowed limited aid deliveries to resume via the Egyptian-controlled Rafah border crossing on 21 October. However, the UN says the number of lorries entering each day has been about a fifth of the daily average of 500 before the war. On Wednesday, Israel opened the Kerem Shalom goods crossing with Gaza for security checks on aid shipments delivered via Rafah.  This could mean that more aid is able to enter Gaza each day.  However, the UN says its ability to receive incoming aid is being significantly undermined by a shortage of lorries within Gaza; the lack of fuel; telecommunications blackouts; and the increasing number of staff unable to reach the Rafah crossing safely due to the intensity of hostilities in the south. Aid distribution has also largely stopped outside the Rafah area due to the fighting. Israel has severely limited supplies of fuel, arguing that it could be stolen by Hamas and used for military purposes. Fuel shortages have meant that water pumps and desalination plants, waste and sanitation services, and many bakeries have been unable to function. Hundreds of foreign passport holders - including some British and US citizens - and seriously wounded and sick Palestinians have also been allowed to leave through Rafah, but many remain.  On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel, breaking through the heavily guarded perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders.  It was the most serious cross-border attack against Israel in more than a generation. The gunmen killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.  The BBC has also seen and heard evidence of rape, sexual violence and mutilation of women during the Hamas attacks, Victims included children, teenagers and pensioners. The attacks came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions: 2023 has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.  Hamas is a Palestinian group which has run Gaza since 2007.  The name is an acronym for Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya, which means Islamic Resistance Movement. The group wants to destroy Israel and replace it with an Islamic state.  Its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, is thought to have about 30,000 members.  Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power, firing thousands of rockets into Israel and carrying out other deadly attacks.  In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes, sending in troops in 2008 and 2014.  Hamas - or in some cases the al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the US, the EU and the UK, as well as other powers.  Iran backs the group, providing funding, weapons and training. The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea.  Previously occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six-Day War. Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005. Home to 2.2 million people, the narrow strip is one of the most densely-populated areas in the world.  Just over three-quarters of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN.  Before the latest conflict, more than 500,000 people lived in eight refugee camps located across the Strip.  Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and strictly limits the movement of people and goods. The West Bank and Gaza are known as the Palestinian territories. Along with East Jerusalem and Israel, they formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century. In 1948, part of Palestine became Israel, which was recognised by the United Nations the following year. The West Bank (including East Jerusalem) and Gaza are recognised as Palestine by many countries and bodies, although it does not have member status at the UN.  Those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist also still refer to all of the land as Palestine. The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation.  He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party - a bitter rival of Hamas.","What is happening in Israel and Gaza, and why now?",What is Hamas and why is it fighting with Israel in Gaza?,"israel,israel_and_the_palestinians,hamas,gaza",http://bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-67039975,articles/article_1832.txt,results/article_1832.txt.json
1833,2023-12-01 11:08:41+00:00,/news/world-middle-east-67477240,"A total of 110 hostages, taken prisoner during the 7 October attacks on Israel, have now been released. Seventy-eight of them are Israeli women and children, who were freed as part of a deal between Israel and Hamas. Three Russian-Israelis, two women and one man not included in the deal, have also been handed over. Five Israelis had already been released in October.  Twenty-three Thai hostages and one Filipino were freed as part of a separate deal between Hamas and the Thai government. Under the deal between Hamas and Israel, 180 Palestinians have been released from Israeli jails. A six-day ceasefire, which has now ended, also allowed hundreds of lorries of humanitarian aid, medical supplies and fuel into Gaza.   Mia Schem, 21, holds dual French-Israeli nationality. She appeared in the first hostage video released by Hamas saying that she had been abducted from the Supernova festival.  Amit Soussana, 40, a lawyer, was at home with a fever when Hamas attacked Kibbutz Kfar Aza. Her family told the Times of Israel she had messaged to say she could hear shooting and was going to hide in her safe room.  Aisha Zyadna, 16, and her brother Bilal, 18, have been released, but their brother Hamza, and their father, remain in captivity.  Nili Margalit, 41, a nurse, had been kidnapped from her home in Kibbutz Nir Oz. Shani Goren, 29, was also taken from Nir Oz and later seen by family members in a video posted by Hamas. The granddaughter of Uruguayan nationals, she was granted citizenship following her abduction. Uruguay told local media it had been working for her release.  Ilana Gritzewsky 30, was taken hostage from Nir Oz along with her Israeli partner, Matan Zanguaker, according to Ilana's father. Ilana arrived in Israel from Mexico 14 years ago. Matan remains a hostage.  Raya Rotem, 54, was released on Wednesday 29 November, a few days after her daughter Hila Rotem Shoshani, 13. They had been kidnapped from Kibbutz Be'eri. Itay Regev, 18, and his sister, Maya Regev, 21, have both now been released. They were taken from the Supernova music festival. The family had previously spotted Itay in a Hamas video, wearing handcuffs in the back of a vehicle. Amit Shani, 16, was the only member of his family taken when Hamas gunmen broke into his family's safe room in Kibbutz Be'eri. Also taken from Be'eri was Ofir Engel, 18, an Israeli-Dutch national, who was visiting his girlfriend, Yuval, when Hamas arrived. He was abducted along with Yuval's father, Yosi Sharabi, 51, and her uncle, Eli Sharabi, 55. They remain in captivity. Eli's wife and two daughters were murdered in the attack.  Gali Tarshansky, 13, had also been kidnapped from Be'eri. Her brother, Lior, was killed in the attack. Yarden Roman-Gat, a 36-year-old German-Israeli citizen, has been reunited with her husband and young child after being abducted from Be'eri. Her husband Alon, and three-year-old Gefen managed to escape, but Yarden became separated from them. Raz Ben Ami, 57, and Moran Stella Yanai, 40, were confirmed as having been released on 29 November.  Liat Atzili, 49, a dual US-Israeli citizen was also released.  Sapir Cohen, 29, was kidnapped along with her partner Alexander (Sasha) Trupanov who is still held captive by Hamas. She was released a day after his mother and grandmother, Lena Trupanov, 50, and Irena Tati, 73, were freed. Both older women held dual Russian-Israeli nationality, and Hamas said their release was a ""tribute"" to Russian President Vladimir Putin - who refused to condemn the group following the 7 October attacks - and not part of the deal with Israel. Hamas also released another Russian-Israeli on the same grounds. Roni Krivoi, 25, was working as a sound engineer at the Supernova music festival when he was kidnapped. Three members of an Argentinian-Israeli family were released together. Mia Leimberg, 17, her mother Gabriela, 59, and Mia's aunt Clara Marman, 63, were taken from Nir Yitzhak. Gabriela and Clara's brother Fernando Simon Marman, and Clara's partner Louis Har, have not been released. Sharon Aloni Cunio, 34, and her three-year-old twin daughters Ema and Yuly, have been released, but David Cunio, Sharon's husband and father of the two girls, remains in Gaza.  The four were kidnapped from Nir Oz along with Sharon's sister, Daniele Aloni, and her six-year-old daughter Emilia.  Both have now been released. Or Yaakov, 16, and his younger brother Yagil, who turned 13 during captivity, were freed, but their father Yair Yaakov, 59, remains a hostage. Yair's partner Meirav Tal, 53, has also been released. Rimon Buchshtab Kirsht, 36, was taken hostage along with her husband Yagev. She has now been freed, but he remains a hostage. Siblings Sahar Kalderon, 16, and Erez, 12, were released after being taken by Hamas from Nir Oz.  Karina Engel-Bart, 52, and her two daughters Mika Engel, 18, and Yuval Engel, 11, have been released. Eitan Yahalomi, 12, has been freed. His father, Ohad, who was shot and injured as he tried to defend their family home, is believed to be a hostage. Emily Hand, 9, was released after being held in Gaza without any of her family. The Irish-Israeli girl, who went missing from Be'eri, turned nine while she was a hostage. Her father, Tom Hand, who was originally told Emily had been killed, gave a statement to the BBC following her release.  ""We can't find the words to describe our emotions after 50 challenging and complicated days,"" he said, adding that while the family was ""happy to hug Emily again"", they have not forgotten the other people still being held captive.  Doron Katz Asher, 34, and her two daughters Raz, four, and Aviv, two, were taken captive while staying with relatives near the Gaza border. Doron's husband, Yoni, saw a video of his wife and daughters being loaded on to a truck with other hostages.  ""I am determined to bring about the resurrection of my family from the trauma and the terrible bereavement we went through,"" Mr Asher told the BBC following their release. ""I don't celebrate, I won't celebrate until the last of the kidnapped returns,"" he said. ""The families of the kidnapped are not posters, they are not slogans, they are real people, and the families of the kidnapped are from today my new family, and I will make sure and do everything that the last of the kidnapped comes home. "" Israeli-American Avigail Idan was just three when she was taken hostage from her home at Kibbutz Kfar Aza. Her parents were attacked and killed, but she survived and walked to the home of her neighbours, the Brodutch family. She was then abducted along with Hagar Brodutch, 40, and her children Oria, 4, Yuval, 8, and Offri, 10. All four have now been released. Her father-in-law, Shmuel Brodutch, told Israel's Channel 13 News: ""The moment I heard they were in the hands of the Red Cross, I was relieved. "" Ohad Munder-Zichri, 9, his mother, Keren Munder, 54, and his grandmother Ruthi Munder, 78, were kidnapped from Nir Oz. Ohad's ninth birthday took place while he was in Gaza. Another family member, Avraham Munder, is still being held hostage. Itay Ravi, Avraham's nephew, told BBC Newsnight the release of some of his family members was ""one step towards being happy"" but that ""it's still a very, very horrific reality that we're in"".  Noam Or, 17, and his sister Alma, 13, were released on 25 November. Their brother, Liam Or, 18, was released a few days later. They had been taken from their home in Be'eri, along with their father Dror Or, 48, who remains a hostage. The body of Yonat, 50 - Dror's wife and the children's mother - was identified among the 120 people killed at the kibbutz. Noam and Alma's uncle, Ahal Besorai, told the BBC that the siblings did not know their mother had been killed. ""We had to bring the sad news to them,"" he said. Sisters Dafna, 15, and Ela Elyakim, 8, were taken from their home in Nir Oz on the day of the attack, and were part of a family group whose capture was live-streamed by the attackers. The girls' mother, Maayan Zin, said in a statement that she was happy her daughters had returned, adding that since they were kidnapped, she had been living ""between despair and hope, between pain and optimism"". Chen Almog-Goldstein, 48, and her children Tal, 8, Gal, 11, and Agam, 17, were abducted from their homes in Kibbutz Kfar Aza on the day of the attack. Chen's husband, Nadav, and their 20-year-old daughter, Yam, were killed by Hamas. Tamar Metzger, 78, has been freed but her husband Yoram - who has diabetes and broke his hip six months ago - remains in captivity.  Ditza Heiman, 84, is one of the founders of Kibbutz Nir Oz and a former social worker. She is the widow of Zvi Shdaimah, who came to the UK on the Kindertransport, the organised rescue of children from Nazi-controlled areas during World War Two. Ofelia Adit Roitman, 77, is a former head teacher who was taken from Kibbutz Nir Oz by Hamas.  Ada Sagi, who turned 75 while in captivity, was abducted from her home in Kibbutz Nir Oz.  Noralin ""Nataly"" Babadila - or Noralin Agojo in some reports - is 60, and had been visiting Kibbutz Nirim to celebrate the community's 70th anniversary when she was kidnapped by Hamas. Her partner, Gideon, was murdered that day. Hanna Katzir, 77, was abducted from Nir Oz, along with her son, Elad Katzir, 47. On 9 November she appeared in a hostage video released by Hamas. Channah Peri, 79, was taken hostage along with her son Nadav Popplewell, 51. Channah emigrated to Israel in the 1960s from South Africa and has three children. Dr Shoshan Haran, 67, was kidnapped from her home in Kibbutz Be'eri, on 7 October. She is the founder of a not-for-profit organisation to help feed those in poverty and has a PhD in agronomy. She was released along with her daughter Adi Shoham, 38, and her children, Nave, eight, and Yahel, three. Dr Haran's husband, Avshalom - an economist and dual German-Israeli citizen - was killed in the Hamas attack, while Adi's husband, Tal, 38, remains in captivity. Also released were Sharon Avigdori, 52, a drama therapist, and her daughter Noam, 12, who are relatives of Dr Haran and were kidnapped from Be'eri at the same time. Family members Eviatar Kipnis, 65 and his wife Lilach Kipnis, 60, were killed in the attack, the family has said. Yafa Adar, 85, was kidnapped from Nir Oz. She has three children, eight grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren, the group speaking for families said. Yafa's grandson Tamir, 38, who defended the kibbutz as part of the Nir Oz emergency squad, was also taken to Gaza, the Times of Israel reported. Shiri Weiss, 53 and her daughter Noga, 18, were taken from Be'eri, along with Shiri's husband Ilan Weiss, 58, who is Noga's father. Shiri is an accountant for the kibbutz's agricultural association.  Adrienne Aviva Seigel, 62, was taken from her home in Kfar Aza along with her 64-year-old husband Keith, his brother told the BBC. Keith is thought to be among the remaining hostages.  Margalit Mozes, 78, was abducted from her home in Kibbutz Nir Oz. A cancer survivor, her family say she has other health problems that require almost constant medical care. Adina Moshe, 72, was kidnapped from Nir Oz. Her husband Said Moshe was killed in the attack, according to a group that has been speaking on behalf of many hostages and their families. Afterwards, she was identified by her family in a video clip showing her wedged between two Hamas fighters on a motorbike. After her release, Elma Avraham, 84, was airlifted to Soroka hospital in Beersheba in a serious condition. She had lived at Kibbutz Nahal Oz for nearly 50 years before she was kidnapped, a spokesman for the community said.  What we know about Israel-Hamas hostage deal Prior to the deal struck between Israel and Hamas, four hostages were released, and another was freed by Israeli forces: Twenty foreign workers have been released during the ceasefire. Nineteen of these are from Thailand.  Boonthom Pankhong, 39, and his girlfriend, Natthawaree Mulakan, were released by Hamas on 24 November. Boonthom's sister Urai Chantachart told BBC Thai that the family was ""overjoyed"". ""Our family has been suffering for over a month, but we never thought he was dead. We strongly believed that he [was] still alive,"" she said. She added he had been working in Israel for five years when he was kidnapped, and was the family's main breadwinner.  It was initially feared Wichai Kalapat was among the Thai nationals killed in the Hamas raid until his girlfriend received word that he was being held hostage in Gaza. She told the BBC she was ""so happy"" because she did not think he would be among those who were released. Seven other hostages were also released on the same day. Their names are Uthai Thunsri, Buddee Saengboon, Bancha Kongmanee, Withoon Phumee, Mongkhol Phajuabboon, Santi Boonphrom, and Uthai Sangnuan.  Natthaphon Onkaew, Khomkrit Chombua were among the four Thai nationals released on 25 November, according to the country's prime minister, Srettha Thavisin.  Anucha Angkaew was also freed. His wife, Wanida Maarsa, told BBC Thai that her husband, who had been working on an avocado farm for almost two years, was one of those taken captive by Hamas militants. The fourth person released was Manee Jirachat, who travelled to Israel for work four years ago. He was seized by Hamas along with five other workers who had taken cover together, according to a Thai TV interview with his father, who had spoken to survivors. It was announced on 26 November that Wichian Temthong, Surin Kesungnoen and Phonsawan Pinakalo had been freed.  Two more Thai hostages were released on Tuesday 28 November - O-wat Suriyasri and Pattanayuth Tonsokri - and four were released the next day. Their names are Piboon Rattanil, Kong Saelao, Jakrapan Sikena and Chalermchai Sangkaew. Gelienor ""Jimmy"" Leano Pacheco, 33, from the Philippines, was also released as part of the same deal. The father of three had been working in Israel as a caregiver to 80-year-old Amita Ben Zvi, who was killed in the attack on Nir Oz.",Who are the released hostages?,Who are the released hostages?,"israel,israel-gaza_war,gaza",http://bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-67477240,articles/article_1833.txt,results/article_1833.txt.json
1834,2023-12-17 02:46:00+00:00,/news/world-us-canada-67693315,"After the shooting of three college students in New England and a string of other incidents, Palestinian Americans say they are worried about their safety.  When Samer Elbandak heard that three young Palestinian men were shot over American Thanksgiving weekend in Burlington, Vermont, he immediately feared for his 16-year-old daughter. His daughter, who lives in Florida, is vocal about the plight of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. On her Instagram page, the Palestinian flag is prominently displayed. Embracing her identity is something that Mr Elbandak, a Palestinian-American Christian who was born and raised in Bethlehem and who immigrated to San Francisco 30 years ago, had always encouraged. But a week after the shooting of Hisham Awartani, Kinnan Abdalhamid and Tahseen Ali Ahmad - three 20-year-old Palestinian-American students - Mr Elbandak said he decided to fly to Florida to have a difficult conversation with his daughter.  ""I explained to her that she needs to be very careful,"" he said. ""There are some people that are blind, that are full of hatred. "" Palestinian parents in the US like Mr Elbandak say they are increasingly having their version of ""the talk"" - a conversation about encountering racism that has long been held in African-American and other minority households - after a recent string of incidents where people who are visibly Palestinian have been attacked. Police in Burlington said they are still investigating whether the 24 November shooting of the three men was a hate crime. The suspect, Jason Eaton, pleaded not guilty to attempted murder charges.  The victims of the attack maintain they were targeted because of their ethnicity.  They were speaking a mix of Arabic and English at the time of the attack, and two of them were wearing keffiyehs - a traditional, Palestinian black-and-white scarf that often serves as a symbol of Palestinian identity and solidarity.  Some say the incident has left them fearful that being visibly Palestinian in the US has become a risk since the Israel-Gaza war erupted on 7 October. Among those who felt this concern is Anne Bordonaro, a mother of two Palestinian college-aged men born and raised in Burlington. ""I looked at the picture of the three young men and I just felt a gut punch,"" Ms Bordonaro said. ""I said, those are my kids. ""  She then called her two boys and had a ""painful conversation"", in which she suggested they avoid wearing their keffiyehs in public.  ""My younger son often wears one, it's just a symbol of identity, it is just part of who he is,"" Ms Bordonaro said, but she added she worried it made him a target.  At the time of the Burlington shootings, the Palestinian community in the US - a small diaspora of around 220,000 - was already reeling from the murder on 14 October of a six-year-old Illinois boy, Wadea Al-Fayoume.  Prosecutors have accused the suspect in Wadea's death of deliberately targeting the child and his mother for being Palestinian.  The Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair) said it had received an ""unprecedented"" amount of reports of anti-Arab and anti-Muslim bias since 7 October, recording a total of 2,171 requests for help across the US as of December. The wife of a Harvard professor was caught on video harassing a student for wearing a keffiyeh, calling it a ""terrorist scarf"".  On 7 November, a man wearing a keffiyeh was allegedly assaulted while he was at a playground with his son in Brooklyn, New York.  In another incident 10 days later, it is alleged that a Yemeni-American Muslim woman was targeted on the New York subway by a man who called her a ""terrorist"", hit her and broke a Palestinian flag she was carrying.  Ayah Zaki, a civil rights attorney for Cair in New Jersey, said that Palestinian mothers have recently been coming to her for advice on how to speak with their children about the issue. ""There's a fear-saturated conversation happening in households between the children who want to speak up about their identity, and moms who are absolutely terrified of them being in harm's way,"" Ms Zaki said.  Ms Zaki said much of the racism Palestinians are facing is rooted in prejudices against Arabs and Muslims in the US that peaked after the attacks of 11 September 2001. She added the divisive political discourse in the US around the Israel-Gaza war is part of the problem. Abeer Ramadan-Shinnawi, an education consultant and mother based in Maryland, said that as a Palestinian born and raised in the US, she has often felt ""othered"" in American society - something that she said is also experienced by other minorities in the country.  ""There is no sense of acceptance,"" Ms Ramadan-Shinnawi said.  But amid the fear and frustration is also resilience. A few days after the Burlington shootings, two vigils were held back-to-back in the city to honour the three young Palestinian men who were shot. One was held across from the hospital in which they were recovering, where a few people arrived wearing keffiyehs.  And some like Ms Bornadaro have since been reflecting on the agonising conversations they have had with their children. ""I have decided to get myself a keffiyeh again,"" she told the BBC, a few weeks after the Burlington shooting had passed.  ""I used to wear one many years ago,"" she said, adding that she feels compelled to wear it again in solidarity.",Why US-Palestinian families are having 'the talk',Why US-Palestinian families are having 'the talk',"israel_and_the_palestinians,israel-gaza_war",http://bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-67693315,articles/article_1834.txt,results/article_1834.txt.json
1835,2023-12-13 16:59:10+00:00,/news/world-middle-east-67039975,"Hamas gunmen launched an unprecedented assault on Israel from the Gaza Strip on 7 October, killing 1,200 people and taking about 240 hostages. The Israeli military responded with air strikes on Gaza, and launched a ground offensive. More than 18,600 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run government. During a temporary truce that lasted seven days, Hamas released 105 hostages and Israel freed 240 Palestinian prisoners in exchange. Israel Defense Forces (IDF) warplanes have been carrying out strikes across Gaza while its troops move through the territory. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel has a ""clear goal of destroying Hamas's military and governing capabilities"", as well as freeing the hostages. He also declared that Israel would have ""overall security responsibility"" for the Gaza Strip ""for an indefinite period"" after the conflict. However, Israel later said it has no plans to reoccupy the territory. Israel has drafted 300,000 reservists for the operation, to boost its standing force of 160,000. The IDF says it has struck thousands of targets belonging to Hamas - which Israel, the UK, US and other Western powers class as a terrorist organisation. It also says it has destroyed hundreds of tunnel shafts built underneath Gaza. Hamas has claimed that its tunnel network stretches for 500km (310 miles).  A number of hospitals in the north were caught up in intense fighting. Satellite images suggest that nearly 100,000 Gaza buildings may have been damaged during the fighting.  Since the ceasefire ended, Israeli troops have pushed into southern Gaza, and have taken ""aggressive"" action against Hamas and other armed groups in and around the city of Khan Younis.  Israel has also carried out many air strikes on Rafah, near the Egyptian border, where it has told residents of Khan Younis to flee. There continues to be fierce fighting in the north, around Jabalia refugee camp and the Shejaiya district of Gaza City. Hundreds of thousands of civilians are thought to remain in the north.  Israel claims to have killed thousands of Hamas fighters during the war, including many commanders.  The IDF says 115 Israeli soldiers have been killed since the start of the ground offensive on 27 October. In total, 444 soldiers have been killed since 7 October, the vast majority of them in Hamas's attacks that day.  During the 7 October attacks, Hamas took about 240 hostages. It says it hid them in ""safe places and tunnels"" within Gaza. According to Israel, more than 30 of the hostages were children, and at least 10 were aged over 60. It also said about half of the hostages had foreign passports from 25 different countries. Under a deal brokered by Qatar, a seven-day pause in fighting began on 24 November. During the truce, which ended on 1 December, 81 Israelis and dual nationals, along with 24 foreigners, were released. In return for the Israeli hostages, 240 Palestinians held in Israeli jails were freed. The released hostages included: Hamas released four Israeli hostages before the truce agreement, and another was freed by Israeli forces. The IDF has said 135 hostages are still being held by Hamas. Nineteen of them are presumed dead, according to Reuters news agency. Hamas has said other armed groups in Gaza are holding hostages, including Palestinian Islamic Jihad. This could complicate any future releases. On Tuesday, the UN General Assembly overwhelmingly supported a non-binding resolution demanding a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza. The US voted against the resolution. However, President Joe Bidencriticised Israel's ""indiscriminate bombing"" of Gaza. Mr Netanyahu has admitted that Israel has been ""not successful"" in minimising civilian casualties, but he has insisted this is because Hamas uses Gaza's civilian population as human shields. More than 50,000 people have been injured since the start of the war, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.  The World Health Organization (WHO) says only 11 out of Gaza's 36 hospitals are still partly functional and able to admit new patients. Only one of them is in the north. Food is scarce in Gaza and prices have soared, meaning many people are unable to afford staples such as flour. A lack of power makes cooking difficult.  Unrwa, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, has said that 1.9 million Gaza's residents - about 85% of the population - have been displaced and that 1.3 million of them have been sheltering in its facilities. This includes the hundreds of thousands of people who fled the fighting in the north after an Israeli order to move south of the Wadi Gaza river valley for their own safety. Unrwa warned that the 600,000 people in southern Gaza who have been ordered to leave their neighbourhoods because of the fighting have nowhere to go, since its own shelters are already beyond capacity.  Israel's military published an online map with Gaza split into more than 600 blocks, showing areas where people should evacuate for their own safety. But Unicef, the UN charity for children, warned that some of the ""safe"" zones are ""tiny patches of barren land"" with no water, sanitation or shelter.  Tens of thousands have fled to Rafah.  After the 7 October attacks, Israel shut its border crossings with Gaza, preventing the usual supplies of food, water, fuel and medicine from entering the territory.  Israel allowed limited aid deliveries to resume via the Egyptian-controlled Rafah border crossing on 21 October. However, the UN says the number of lorries entering each day has been about a fifth of the daily average of 500 before the war. On Wednesday, Israel opened the Kerem Shalom goods crossing with Gaza for security checks on aid shipments delivered via Rafah.  This could mean that more aid is able to enter Gaza each day.  However, the UN says its ability to receive incoming aid is being significantly undermined by a shortage of lorries within Gaza; the lack of fuel; telecommunications blackouts; and the increasing number of staff unable to reach the Rafah crossing safely due to the intensity of hostilities in the south. Aid distribution has also largely stopped outside the Rafah area due to the fighting. Israel has severely limited supplies of fuel, arguing that it could be stolen by Hamas and used for military purposes. Fuel shortages have meant that water pumps and desalination plants, waste and sanitation services, and many bakeries have been unable to function. Hundreds of foreign passport holders - including some British and US citizens - and seriously wounded and sick Palestinians have also been allowed to leave through Rafah, but many remain.  On 7 October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel, breaking through the heavily guarded perimeter fence, landing by sea, and using paragliders.  It was the most serious cross-border attack against Israel in more than a generation. The gunmen killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, in a series of raids on military posts, kibbutzim and a music festival, and took hostages back into Gaza.  The BBC has also seen and heard evidence of rape, sexual violence and mutilation of women during the Hamas attacks, Victims included children, teenagers and pensioners. The attacks came at a time of soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions: 2023 has been the deadliest on record for Palestinians who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.  Hamas is a Palestinian group which has run Gaza since 2007.  The name is an acronym for Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya, which means Islamic Resistance Movement. The group wants to destroy Israel and replace it with an Islamic state.  Its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, is thought to have about 30,000 members.  Hamas has fought several wars with Israel since it took power, firing thousands of rockets into Israel and carrying out other deadly attacks.  In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes, sending in troops in 2008 and 2014.  Hamas - or in some cases the al-Qassam Brigades - has been designated a terrorist group by Israel, the US, the EU and the UK, as well as other powers.  Iran backs the group, providing funding, weapons and training. The Gaza Strip is a 41km (25-mile) long and 10km-wide territory located between Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea.  Previously occupied by Egypt, Gaza was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six-Day War. Israel withdrew its troops and around 7,000 settlers from the territory in 2005. Home to 2.2 million people, the narrow strip is one of the most densely-populated areas in the world.  Just over three-quarters of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - are registered refugees or descendants of refugees, according to the UN.  Before the latest conflict, more than 500,000 people lived in eight refugee camps located across the Strip.  Israel controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, and strictly limits the movement of people and goods. The West Bank and Gaza are known as the Palestinian territories. Along with East Jerusalem and Israel, they formed part of a land known as Palestine from Roman times until the mid-20th Century. In 1948, part of Palestine became Israel, which was recognised by the United Nations the following year. The West Bank (including East Jerusalem) and Gaza are recognised as Palestine by many countries and bodies, although it does not have member status at the UN.  Those who do not recognise Israel's right to exist also still refer to all of the land as Palestine. The Palestinian president is Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen. He is based in the West Bank, which is under Israeli occupation.  He has been the leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2005, and represents the Fatah political party - a bitter rival of Hamas.",Why are Israel and Hamas fighting in Gaza?,What is Hamas and why is it fighting with Israel in Gaza?,"israel,israel_and_the_palestinians,israel-gaza_war,hamas,gaza",http://bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-67039975,articles/article_1835.txt,results/article_1835.txt.json
1836,2023-12-01 12:40:25+00:00,/news/world-middle-east-67589259,"Fighting resumed between Israel and Hamas on Friday morning, ending a seven-day ceasefire between the two sides that had seen hostages and prisoners released and much-needed humanitarian assistance reaching the Gaza Strip.  Here's a look at some of the key questions around the latest developments.  An hour before the ceasefire was due to end at 07:00 local time (05:00 GMT), the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) reported that sirens were sounding for communities close to the Gaza Strip - it then said it had intercepted a rocket fired from the enclave.  An hour later, Israel's military said fighting had resumed, accusing Hamas of violating the terms of the agreement.  The IDF then said its fighter jets were striking Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip.  Shortly after, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Hamas had not ""met its obligation to release all of the women hostages today and has launched rockets at Israeli citizens"". However, Hamas blamed Israel for the resumption in fighting, saying it refused ""to accept all offers to release other hostages"".  ""The occupation had a prior decision to resume the criminal aggression,"" it said in a statement, blaming US President Joe Biden for ""the continuation of Zionist war crimes in the Gaza Strip"" and ""giving the green light to Israel"".  Throughout the week-long ceasefire, Mr Netanyahu has come under pressure, particularly from right-wing elements in his government, to re-start the war - something Israel has continually made clear it intended to do once the agreement had come to an end.   Despite this, there are still hopes that a new agreement could be reached. Qatar, which has played a crucial role so far in negotiations over a ceasefire, confirmed on Friday that talks were continuing ""with the aim of returning to a pause"".  Within seven hours of the fighting resuming, the Hamas-run health ministry said more than 60 people had been killed, adding to the nearly 15,000 Palestinians it said were killed before the ceasefire.  James Elder from Unicef, the UN children's agency, spoke to the BBC from a hospital in southern Gaza after the bombing started, describing the situation as ""terrifying"".  He said it was ""horrendous for people"" and that ""you see the fear on their faces"", adding that a strike had hit close to the facility he was in.  He described the end of the ceasefire as ""the nightmare that everyone utterly feared"".  Before the ceasefire, the Gaza Strip had undergone widespread destruction as Israel conducted its retaliatory campaign in response to Hamas's deadly 7 October attacks.  Israel claimed to have used more than 10,000 bombs and missiles, and BBC analysis found that almost 98,000 buildings in Gaza may have suffered damage, with most concentrated in the north.  The strikes also brought humanitarian aid to a halt. Aid agencies were able to use the pause in fighting to get crucial assistance in, but reported finding devastation in many of the areas they reached.  Although negotiations continue in the hope of a new deal being reached, for now it's clear that the war has resumed.  After weeks of intense fighting in the north of the Gaza Strip - particularly around Gaza City - Israel's military now appears to be focussing much of its attention on the south, where renewed air strikes have been reported.  The IDF has also created a map of Gaza divided into more than 2,000 zones, which it said will be used to help people in Gaza escape future fighting. It said the map is split into areas to enable people to ""evacuate from specific places for their safety if required"".  On Friday, Israeli jets dropped leaflets over areas east and north of Khan Younis, the largest city in southern Gaza, linking to the map. The flyers did not refer to any of the numbered blocks, but a message in Arabic told residents in four named - but not numbered - areas to ""evacuate immediately and go to shelters in Rafah"".  The renewed fighting comes after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Israeli officials, where he insisted the next stage of the war must ensure civilians are protected.  Mr Blinken said he had told the Israeli government that it must avoid further mass displacement of Palestinians and damage to critical infrastructure, such as hospitals, power stations and water facilities.  During the seven-day ceasefire, Hamas agreed to release 110 people from Gaza, including 78 Israeli women and children.  As part of the deal, 240 Palestinians were also released from Israeli jails. They had been accused of a range of offences, from throwing stones to incitement and attempted murder.  Many of the Palestinians released had not been convicted of crimes, and were being held on remand while awaiting trial. Some said they had been subjected to abuse and collective punishment after the 7 October attacks. Israel says all its prisoners are detained according to the law. It is estimated that about 140 Israeli hostages remain in captivity in Gaza.

The flyers did not refer to any of the numbered blocks, but a message in Arabic told residents in four named - but not numbered - areas to ""evacuate immediately and go to shelters in Rafah"".  The renewed fighting comes after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Israeli officials, where he insisted the next stage of the war must ensure civilians are protected.  Mr Blinken said he had told the Israeli government that it must avoid further mass displacement of Palestinians and damage to critical infrastructure, such as hospitals, power stations and water facilities.  During the seven-day ceasefire, Hamas agreed to release 110 people from Gaza, including 78 Israeli women and children.  As part of the deal, 240 Palestinians were also released from Israeli jails. They had been accused of a range of offences, from throwing stones to incitement and attempted murder.  Many of the Palestinians released had not been convicted of crimes, and were being held on remand while awaiting trial. Some said they had been subjected to abuse and collective punishment after the 7 October attacks. Israel says all its prisoners are detained according to the law. It is estimated that about 140 Israeli hostages remain in captivity in Gaza.

1839,2023-12-15 16:12:22+00:00,/news/world-middle-east-67727601,"Two cargo ships in the Red Sea have been attacked by missiles fired from territory in Yemen, the US says. One was hit with a drone and another by missiles, both launched from a part of Yemen controlled by the Houthis - a rebel movement backed by Iran. The Houthis did not confirm the drone strike, but said they did fire missiles at the second boat - and a third one.   It is the latest attack on foreign ships in the area since the start of the Israel-Hamas war.  The Houthis - who seized power nine years ago - have declared their support for Hamas and say they are targeting ships travelling to Israel. The vessels came under attack in the Bab El Mandab - a narrow strait of water that is vital for global trade. Referring to the alleged drone attack, a US defence official told AFP news agency on Friday: ""We are aware that something launched from a Houthi-controlled region of Yemen struck this vessel which was damaged, and there was a report of a fire. "" That container ship, called the Al Jasrah, is owned by German transport company Hapag-Lloyd, and flagged to Liberia in West Africa.  A Hapag-Lloyd spokesman told AFP that the ship was on its way to Singapore from the Greek port of Piraeus. There were no casualties and the ship is now continuing towards its destination, he added. The Houthis gave no acknowledgement of a hit on the Al Jasrah, but said they had targeted the MSC Palatium and MSC Alanya with missiles. Giving their own account of a missile strike on a vessel - which they did not name - a US defence official said the hit caused a fire and a US Navy destroyer was on its way to put it out. The US is under pressure from Israel to do something about these attacks but Washington is reluctant to target the Houthi missile sites for fear of widening the Israel-Hamas conflict and triggering retaliation by Iran. Instead, it is more likely there would be a multinational naval coalition forming to protect shipping and shoot down any incoming missiles and drones. US national security adviser Jake Sullivan - who is on a trip to the Middle East - said the Houthis were a ""material threat"" to shipping and commerce in the region. He said Iran bore ultimate responsibility for the attacks, adding: ""While the Houthis are pulling the trigger, so to speak, they're being handed the gun by Iran. ""Iran has a responsibility to take steps themselves to cease these attacks, because these attacks, as I said before, are a fundamental threat to international law and international peace and security. "" More incidents were also reported in the region on Friday - including a separate report elsewhere that another ship had been hijacked. The UK's maritime trade operations agency said it had received a report that a crew of a ship further east in the Arabian Sea was no longer in control of a vessel, and it was heading towards Somalia. ""At present all crew are reported as safe"" the UKMTO said. The latest attacks follow several earlier ones in the southern Red Sea, pushing up insurance premiums and potentially making some ships go all the way round Cape of Good Hope in South Africa to avoid the Red Sea.  The Houthis - who are fighting Yemen's Saudi-backed government - have declared themselves part of an ""axis of resistance"" of Iran-affiliated groups opposing Israel, the US, and the wider West. They have already attacked several commercial ships this month, prompting a US destroyer to intervene, and in November they successfully hijacked a cargo ship. US, French and British warships have been patrolling the Red Sea area and have shot several missiles out of the sky. The Bab El Mandeb Strait is a 20-mile wide channel that separates Eritrea and Djibouti on the African side from Yemen on the Arabian Peninsula.

There were no casualties in the attack. A Houthi spokesman said the MT Strinda was delivering oil to Israel, but the ship's owners said it was headed to Italy with feedstock for biofuel. The group has vowed to block ships of any nation heading to Israel until Israel stops its offensive on Gaza, in what the Houthis say is a show of support for the Palestinians. The United States has said it will consider ""appropriate responses"" to any such attacks, which it describes as ""fully enabled by Iran"". Houthi military spokesman Yahya Saree said in a televised statement that the ship was targeted on Monday after its crew refused to respond to warnings. He said the group had prevented several ships from passing through Yemeni waters in recent days. The MT Strinda was attacked in the Bab El Mandeb strait at the entrance to the Red Sea. The missile caused a fire on board the ship but it was extinguished and the ship was able to make its way on to a safe port, ship owners J Ludwig Mowinckels Rederi said in a statement. They added that the 30-member crew, who are all Indian citizens, were unharmed. A US Navy destroyer provided assistance to the MT Strinda after receiving a mayday call, US officials said.

It is counted in beloved faces that have vanished into the fire and rubble of the war. Thirteen-year-old Rama Zaqout was sleeping when an Israeli missile struck the mosque in which she was sheltering with her family. She woke in hospital to discover that her two-year-old brother Hisham and many other family members were dead. She lists the names of those killed in a voice that seems detached from the immense loss she has experienced. It is the voice of a child still in shock at the loss of her grandparents, Hashim, Issam and Ni'ma, her aunt Reem, and her cousins Sireen, Riham and Asma. Sireen was pregnant and had a young daughter. That child was also among the dead.  What Gaza's reported 20,000 deaths say about the warLive updates: Hamas says 20,000 killed in Gaza as UN delays truce vote Rama survived with severe wounds to her left hand and right leg, but the hospital does not have the facilities to treat her injuries properly. If she is not evacuated from Gaza, she says, both limbs will be amputated. ""Running and drawing were once my best hobbies,"" Rama says, ""but without the proper treatment, I won't be able to enjoy them again… I dream of a life like other children around the world, where I can again run and draw. ""Near to where Rama lies, there is another girl - about 10 years old - who lies strapped into a medical brace. She appears to have suffered a serious back injury. Somebody has given the child some Barbie dolls to play with and a plastic tiara to wear. They are symbols of a vanished normality in a place of the dead and maimed.  She picks up a doll with red hair and caresses it gently. A small child's screaming erupts from another ward. Adult voices can be heard trying to console him. The girl with the doll does not react, as if she is trying to close herself into a world that war cannot reach. Outside the hospital, the soundscape of Gaza is dominated by the rumble of jets, the constant whine of the military drones and the explosions when they find their target. For 24-year-old Tala Abu Nahel, who lives in Rafah in a house shared with nine other families, there is a belief that survival is a matter of luck. We first interviewed Tala more than a month ago, when she tried to escape Gaza with her severely disabled brother, Yazid, aged 17. They were turned back as they did not have foreign passports. Yazid suffers chronic seizures, made much worse now by the absence of medication. Tala explains the psychological torment of living under constant threat of attack. ""Every time I hear like a rocket or bomb that's going to drop on people… it's horrible to say this, but sort of it gives me this, this sort of relief, that it's not us,"" she says. ""But that does not mean that we're fully safe. It's like every day it feels like we're next. And it feels like we're just getting by on luck. I don't think I have any more hope. ""Sitting in his wheelchair in the garden of the house in Rafah, Yazid glances repeatedly upwards in the direction of the drones. Tala strokes her brother's hand to comfort him.  ""It's been over 70 days, with nothing changing. It keeps getting worse,"" she says. ""I think what I fear the most is that I don't want to be a number. I just don't want to die or get killed to be another one of those 20,000 people who got killed. ""The people of Gaza grieve their dead and live in fear of dying themselves. They flee from one unsafe place to another. They endure this because they have no choice. Every border is closed to them. Each day, the funerals of their dead bring forth corpses of all ages, wrapped in white shrouds or in plastic body bags. At the Nasser Medical Complex, a boy prostrates himself on the body of his father lying among a group of corpses. He spreads his arms to hug the dead man, his fingers grasping the plastic sheeting. ""Our dad,"" he sobs, ""I can't take it any more. "" An older male relative reaches in to stroke his arm. But the child is beyond consolation. Eventually he is gently drawn away from his father. The men begin to lift the corpses, one holding each end of the body bag. They move through the gates where they stop and pray for the dead.

1868,2023-12-21 00:19:45+00:00,/news/world-middle-east-67635735,"After weeks of Israeli bombing, on 16 November Jehad El-Mashhrawi and his young family fled their home in northern Gaza. The BBC Arabic cameraman shares a vivid and shocking account of what he, his wife and children experienced as they headed south. Warning: This story contains graphic descriptions which may be distressingWe left in such a hurry. We were in the middle of baking some bread and realised the houses opposite us were being bombed, one by one. I knew it would soon be our turn. We had packed some bags in case this happened but everything was so rushed we forgot to take them. We didn't even shut the front door. We had waited to leave because we didn't want to move my elderly parents and we had taken years to save up to build our house in al-Zeitoun, but in the end we had to go. My baby son, Omar, died there in November 2012, killed when shrapnel hit our house in another war with Israel and I couldn't risk losing any more children. I knew that in the south there was no electricity, no water and people had to queue for hours to use a toilet. But in the end, grabbing just a bottle of water and some leftover bread, we joined thousands of others making the dangerous journey down the Salah al-Din road to the south, where Israel said it was safe. Lots of my family walked together - my wife Ahlam, our four sons, who are two, eight, nine and 14 years old, my parents, brothers, sisters, cousins and their children.    We walked for hours and knew that eventually we would have to go through an Israeli checkpoint that was set up during the war. We were nervous and my children kept asking: ""What will the army do to us?""We came to a stop about two-thirds of a mile (1km) from the checkpoint and joined a huge queue of people that filled the entire road. We spent more than four hours waiting there and my father fainted three times. There were Israeli soldiers watching us from bombed-out buildings on one side of the road and more on an empty plot of land on the other side. As we edged closer to the checkpoint we saw more soldiers above us in a tent on a hill. We think they managed the checkpoint remotely from there, watching us through binoculars and using loudspeakers to tell us what to do. There were two open-sided shipping containers near the tent. All the men had to pass through one and the women through the other, with cameras constantly trained on us. When we had gone through, Israeli soldiers asked to see our IDs and we were photographed. It was like judgement day. I saw about 50 people detained, all men, including two of my neighbours. One young man was stopped because he had lost his documents and couldn't remember his ID number. Another man next to me in the queue was called a terrorist by an Israeli soldier, before he too was taken away. They were told to strip down to their underwear and sit on the ground. Some were later asked to get dressed and leave, while others were blindfolded. I saw four blindfolded detainees, including my neighbours, taken behind a sand hill by a demolished building. When they were out of sight, we heard gunfire. I have no idea whether they were shot or not. Separately, other people who made the same journey as me were contacted by a colleague of mine in Cairo. One of them, Kamal Aljojo, said that just after he went through the checkpoint a week earlier, he had seen dead bodies, but he didn't know how they had died. My colleague also spoke to a man called Muhammed who went through the same checkpoint on 13 November. ""A soldier asked me to strip off all of my clothes, even my underwear,"" Muhammed told the BBC. He added: ""I was naked in front of everyone walking past. I felt ashamed. Suddenly a female soldier pointed her gun at me and laughed before quickly moving it away. I was humiliated. "" Muhammed said he had to wait naked for about two hours before he was allowed to go. Although my wife, children, parents and I all got through the checkpoint safely, two of my brothers were delayed. While we were waiting for them, an Israeli soldier shouted at a group of people in front of us who were trying to go back towards the containers to check on their relatives, who had been held up. He used a loudspeaker to tell them to move on and to stay at least 300yds (300m) away, then a soldier started shooting in the air in their direction to intimidate them. We had heard a lot of gunshots while we were queueing. Everyone was crying and my mother was sobbing: ""What happened to my sons? Did they shoot them?"" After well over an hour my brothers finally appeared.    The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told the BBC that ""individuals suspected of affiliations with terrorist organisations"" were detained for preliminary inquiries, and if they remained suspects they were transferred to Israel for further questioning. Others were ""promptly released"", it said. It said clothes had to be removed to check for explosive vests or other weapons and detainees were clothed as soon possible. It said it did not aim to ""undermine the security and dignity of the detainees"" and that the IDF ""operates in accordance with international law"". The IDF also said it ""does not shoot at civilians moving along the humanitarian corridor from the north to the south"", but when young men tried to move in the opposite direction they ""were met with shots for the purposes of dispersal, after they were told with a loudspeaker not to advance towards the position of the troops and continued to do so"". It added that the sound of shooting was common and ""the sound of gunfire alone does not constitute an indication of shooting from a specific place or of a certain type"". My wife and I felt relieved as we moved on and the checkpoint disappeared from sight behind us, but we had no idea that the hardest part of the journey was yet to come. As we walked further south, I saw about 10 bodies in different places by the roadside. Other scattered, rotting body parts, were covered in flies with birds pecking at the remains. They gave off one of the foulest smells I have ever experienced. I couldn't bear the thought of my children seeing them so I screamed at the top of my lungs, telling them to look at the sky and keep walking. I saw a burned-out car with a severed human head inside. The hands of the headless rotting corpse were still holding the steering wheel. There were also bodies of dead donkeys and horses, some reduced to skeletons, and huge piles of rubbish and spoiled food. Then an Israeli tank appeared on a side road, moving towards us at breakneck speed. We were frightened and in order to get away, we had to run over corpses. Some people in the crowd tripped on the bodies. The tank changed course about 20yds (20m) before it reached the main road. Suddenly, next to the road, a building was bombed. The explosion was terrifying and shrapnel flew everywhere. I wanted the world to swallow us up.  We were shaken and exhausted but carried on towards Nuseirat camp. We arrived there in the evening and had to sleep on the pavement. It was freezing. We put my jacket around our middle sons, tucking their hands into the sleeves to try to keep them warm. We covered our youngest with my shirt. I have never been so cold in all my life. When the BBC asked about the tank and the bodies, the IDF said that ""during the day, tanks move on routes that intersect with the Salah al-Din road, but there was no case in which tanks moved towards civilians moving from north to south of the Gaza Strip on the humanitarian corridor"". The IDF said it did not know of any cases of piles of corpses on the Salah al-Din road but there were times when Gazan vehicles ""abandoned bodies during the journey, which the IDF subsequently evacuated"".  The next morning we set off early for Khan Younis, Gaza's second largest city. We paid someone to take us part of the way in a cart pulled by a donkey. Then at Deir al-Balah, we got on a bus that was only meant to carry 20 people, but 30 people got on board. Some sat on the roof and others clung to the doors and windows from the outside. In Khan Younis, we tried to find a safe place to stay at a UN-run school that had been turned into a shelter, but it was full. We ended up renting a warehouse under a residential building instead and stayed there for a week. My parents, brother and sisters decided to stay in Khan Younis, but after the local market was bombed, my wife and I decided to take our children further south to Rafah to be with her family. They managed to get a lift in a car and I joined them later by bus, but it was so full I had to hang on to the outside of the door. We are now renting a small outhouse with a roof made of tin and plastic. There is nothing to protect us from falling shrapnel.  Everything is expensive and we can't get many of the things we need. If we want drinking water, we have to queue for three hours and we don't have enough food for three meals a day, so we don't eat lunch any more, only breakfast and dinner. My son used to have an egg every day. An egg - can you imagine? I can't even give him that now. All I want to do is leave Gaza and be safe with my children, even if that means living in a tent.

Khawaja, 37, did not wear shoes bearing the words ""all lives are equal"" and ""freedom is a human right"" in Perth, as he had in training. The ICC deemed him in breach of its clothing and equipment regulations. Khawaja is free to play in the second Test, starting on 26 December. However, he faces further sanctions if he wears an armband again or makes an on-field statement in support of Palestinians without the permission of the ICC and Cricket Australia. Israel launched a major military campaign in Gaza in response to a cross-border attack by hundreds of Hamas gunmen on 7 October, in which at least 1,200 people were killed and about 240 others taken hostage. Gaza's health ministry says more than 20,000 people have been killed in the territory since Israel launched its retaliatory campaign against Hamas. Under ICC regulations, players cannot display messages of political, religious or racial causes during international matches. Khawaja, who is Muslim, has said his message is a ""humanitarian appeal"" and not a political statement. ""Usman displayed a personal message (armband) during the first Test match against Pakistan without seeking the prior approval of Cricket Australia and the ICC to display it, as required in the regulations for personal messages,"" said an ICC spokesperson. ""This is a breach under the category of an 'other breach' and the sanction for a first offence is a reprimand. ""Khawaja said he would ""fight"" the decision when he was told not to wear the shoes, which featured writing in red, green and black - the colours of the Palestinian flag. He posted a video message on social media in which he reiterated his support for civilians in Gaza. ""The ICC have told me that I can't wear my shoes on-field because they believe it's a political statement under their guidelines. I don't believe it is,"" he said. ""I will respect their view and decision but I will fight it and seek to gain approval. ""Cricket Australia previously said it supported ""the right of our players to express personal opinions"" but that it expected them to uphold the ICC rules.

2775,2023-12-20 18:30:08+00:00,/news/world-middle-east-67764664,"At least 20,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been reported killed since Israel began bombing the territory in the wake of Hamas's 7 October attacks. BBC Verify examines what Gaza's death toll reveals about the conflict. On average, nearly 300 people have been killed each day since the start of the conflict, excluding the seven-day ceasefire, data from Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry indicates. The World Health Organization's regional emergency director Richard Brennan says he considers these casualty figures trustworthy. Counting the dead is a challenge in any war zone, and doctors in Gaza say the death toll is likely to be significantly higher as it does not include bodies buried under the rubble of destroyed buildings or those not taken to hospitals. BBC Verify has looked in detail at the figures, how they compare with other conflicts and the impact on Gaza's young population. The pace of killing in this war has been ""exceptionally high"", says Prof Michael Spagat, who specialises in examining death tolls in conflicts around the world, such as the 2003 Iraq war, Colombia's civil conflict, wars in the Democratic Republic of Congo as well as previous wars between Israel and Gaza. ""Within the series of Gaza wars stretching back to 2008, the current one is unprecedented both for the number of people killed and for the indiscriminateness of the killing,"" he adds. The 20,000 figure represents almost 1% of Gaza's 2.2 million population. The BBC has spoken to military experts who have described the wide variety of bombs used by Israel - some about 100lb and others as large as 2000lb - as having directly contributed to the scale of fatalities in this conflict. Being near the impact of the largest bombs is like ""surfing on the Earth as the shockwave momentarily liquefies the ground"", says Marc Garlasco, a former senior intelligence analyst at the Pentagon and former UN war crimes investigator, who spoke to victims and witnesses of these bombs. What makes them even more devastating is that Gaza has a very high population density. It is just 41km (25 miles) long and 10km (six miles) wide. On average, before the conflict, there were more than 5,700 people per sq km in Gaza - very similar to the average density in London. 'I don't want to be a number': Gazans live in fear of dyingLive updates: Hamas says 20,000 killed in Gaza as UN delays truce vote Israel began its military campaign in Gaza in the wake of Hamas' attacks, in which 1,200 people were killed, most of them civilians. Three months later, it is facing mounting pressure over the number of civilian casualties. In worldwide conflicts between 2011 and 2021, on average 90% of fatalities were civilians when explosive weapons were used on populated areas, according to the research and advocacy group Action on Armed Violence. According to US intelligence assessments seen by CNN, in this war, Israel had dropped more than 29,000 bombs on Gaza, external since the war began and mid-December, with 40-45% of these unguided. These unguided bombs ""can miss their target by up to 30m, which is the difference between hitting a Hamas HQ and an apartment packed with civilians"", says Mr Garlasco, who has worked on three previous wars in Gaza and is now a military adviser for the Dutch peace organisation PAX. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has said it takes precautionary measures in order to avoid damage to the civilian population. It says these measures include warnings before strikes in cases where it is possible to do so. Israel has also insisted that its record on killing civilians has been better than those in other international conflicts. The IDF says it will ""abort attacks when we see unexpected civilian presence. We choose the right munition for each target - so it doesn't cause unnecessary damage. ""Israel also says that Hamas uses Gaza's civilian population as human shields.  Women and children make up about 70% of those who have been killed in Gaza during the current conflict, says the Hamas-run health ministry. However, Hamas's figures do not distinguish between male civilians and combatants. The previous official breakdown of the deaths from Hamas's Government Media Office on 19 December, which stood at 19,667, said that more than 8,000 children and 6,200 women had been killed. It also said that 310 medical personnel, 35 civil defence personnel and 97 journalists had been killed - all of them civilians. The war is having a particularly devastating impact on Gaza's children. Nearly half of the territory's population is under 18, according to data released in 2022 by the health ministry. There have been over 52,000 people injured in the conflict so far, the health ministry says. While there are no up-to-date figures for the number of children injured, on 3 November there were reportedly 24,173 injured - comprising 8,067 children, 5,960 women and 10,146 men. Gaza is now the ""most dangerous place in the world to be a child"", according to the United Nation's child agency, Unicef. ""Entire neighbourhoods, where children used to play and go to school, have been turned into stacks of rubble, with no life in them,"" said Adele Khodr, Unicef's regional director for the Middle East and North Africa.  Each conflict is unique in the way it is fought, but the experts the BBC has spoken to agree that the rate of killing in Gaza is significantly bigger than in others fought recently. ""What we're seeing in terms of civilian deaths has already far outpaced rates of harm from any given conflict we have documented,"" said Emily Tripp, director of Airwars, an organisation which has monitored civilian deaths in wars and conflicts since 2014. The former Pentagon intelligence analyst Marc Garlasco said: ""To find a similar density of high explosives used in a small populated area, we might have to go back to the Vietnam war for a comparable example - like the 1972 Christmas bombing, when some 20,000 tons of bombs were dropped on Hanoi during Operation Linebacker II. "" An estimated 1,600 Vietnamese civilians were killed in the Christmas bombings. By contrast, US-led coalition air and artillery strikes killed fewer than 20 civilians per day, on average, during the four-month offensive to drive IS out of the Syrian city of Raqqa in 2017, according to Amnesty International. It is unclear how many civilians lived there at the time, but UN officials estimated that there were between 50,000 and 100,000. Additionally, over 160,000 civilians reportedly fled their homes and became internally displaced at the time. And an Associated Press investigation, external suggested that between 9,000 and 11,000 civilians were killed in the nine-month battle between US-backed Iraqi forces and IS for the Iraqi city of Mosul which ended in 2017. This amounts to an estimated fewer-than-40 civilian deaths per day, on average. Mosul had an estimated population of less than two million people when IS captured the city in 2014. During the almost two years of the Ukraine war, the United Nations estimates, external that at least 10,000 civilians have been killed. However, the UN's human rights monitoring mission has also cautioned that the actual figure may be significantly higher given the challenges and time required for verification. And comparing casualty rates in different conflicts is difficult, in part because varying methodologies are used for estimating deaths. Israel has stated its goal is to destroy Hamas but has not been clear how many of its members it has killed. Officials have previously pointed to ""thousands"" and elsewhere ""7,000"". Hamas is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the Israeli and UK governments and others. But when asked directly, the IDF said it ""does not have an exact number on the number of Hamas terrorists killed"". News agency AFP reported that senior Israeli officials had suggested Israel had killed two Palestinian civilians for every one Hamas fighter. That ratio was described by the IDF's spokesman Jonathan Conricus as ""tremendously positive"", to CNN. The BBC has not been able to establish a clear method of verifying the number of fighters killed. Prof Michael Spagat, said he would ""not be at all surprised"" if around 80% of those killed were civilians. The IDF's numbers for combatants killed ""have been all over the place, devoid of details and without explanations"", he added. There are ""no reliable figures"" for the ratio of civilians to combatants killed in Gaza, say Hamit Dardagan and John Sloboda of Iraq Body Count, an organisation that examines the number of deaths in the Iraq war.
