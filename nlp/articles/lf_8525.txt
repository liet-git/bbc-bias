Rafah, in the southern Gaza Strip, has been in the crosshairs of Israeli forces for weeks. Israel has been continuing to bombard the city and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insists he will press on with a full-scale assault on Rafah. The United States, Israel’s staunchest ally, has warned that it would halt the export of artillery shells and other weapons if Israel went ahead with the offensive. Reuters has reported that Israeli tanks have taken the main road dividing the city, effectively encircling the eastern part of Rafah. More than a million Palestinians have taken refuge in Rafah after Israel’s bombardment of Gaza, Khan Younis, and other parts of the enclave. The UN says that more than 80,000 have fled the city since Monday, and UN chief Antonio Guterres says that a ground offensive would lead to an “epic humanitarian disaster”. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
