The Israel Defense Force (IDF) says it is now in control of the al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City, claiming it launched a raid on the site overnight because it was being used as a Hamas base. If you're just joining us, here are the latest developments: A spokesperson said the IDF would ensure the hospital's work could continue during the operation. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza accused Israel of committing a war crime and using "fabricated narratives" . In a statement, Hamas calls it a "new crime" and claims hospital buildings were "directly targeted" People in the hospital and wider area have been told to evacuate to a nearby "humanitarian area" amid reports of heavy gunfire. Thousands had already fled the area since Israel began its operation in October, but the hospital has since been used as a shelter for displaced people. A doctor at al-Shifa tells the BBC his team began hearing gunfire in the early hours . "Anyone in the grounds were targeted," he says. "There is a lot of injured, people are bleeding" The IDF says 80 suspects were arrested in the hospital raid, including Hamas militants. It's also saying one of its own soldiers was killed in the northern Gaza strip on Monday - Israelâ€™s Kan News reports he died in the operation at the hospital.
