Labour MP Jonathan Ashworth is next asked about workers' rights. Laura puts it to him that some of the unions are concerned that Labour is watering down its plans on workers' rights, while some want to see a complete ban on "fire and rehire". This is when workers are dismissed and hired them back straight away - often on worse deals. "We are not watering down our commitment to give more rights to workers in the workplace," Ashworth says. "Our labour market is increasingly characterised by low pay, by fire and rehire, these are outrageous practices, and this is not good for the UK economy," he adds. Laura presses him on whether Labour wants a complete ban on fire and rehire. "Yes, we are getting rid of this practice, we are not watering it down," Ashworth replies. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
