Alba Party MP Neale Hanvey says an incoming Labour government could affect oil and gas jobs, and points to the recent closure of the Grangemouth oil refinery in Scotland. He asks why the government couldn't find the money to secure the refinery's future. Sunak says the future of Grangemouth is a decision for its owners, and that the UK and Scottish governments are working together to make sure there are "efficient assurances" in place for the refinery's employees. On the broader topic of the oil and gas industry, "we will always back our North Sea economy", Sunak says. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
