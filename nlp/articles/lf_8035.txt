The wording of the US draft resolution, which the UN Security Council will vote on shortly, signals growing impatience towards Israel by its closest ally. Since the start of war triggered by Hamas's deadly attack on Israel on 7 October, Washington has vetoed three draft resolutions calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. It has argued that such a move would be wrong while delicate negotiations for a ceasefire and hostage releases were continuing between Israel and Hamas. However, the US's stance has been sharply criticised as shielding Israel from pressure to wind down its offensive amid an escalating death toll in Gaza. Now the US's own text marks a significant departure from its long-held diplomatic position. It says there is "an imperative of an immediate and sustained ceasefire". Importantly, the same sentence goes on to say "and towards that end unequivocally supports" ongoing hostage release negotiations, specifically linking the two. It is unclear whether a majority of the other 14 members of the Security Council will vote in favour of the resolution, which some might feel does not go far enough. But the fact that the US is now backing calls for a ceasefire in principle is another sign of growing tensions between the Biden administration and the government of Benjamin Netanyahu ahead of Israel's looming offensive on Rafah, which the US has made clear it does not unequivocally support.
