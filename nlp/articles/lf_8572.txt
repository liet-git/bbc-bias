The killing of seven aid workers in an Israeli air strike in Gaza on Monday “has damaged Israel’s reputation in Poland”, according the country’s foreign minister, Radek Sikorski. One of the aid workers killed in that strike – Damian Sobol – was Polish, and Sikorski says the group were “just bringing food to needy people” and “were not a danger to anybody”. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme from the Nato conference in Brussels, Sikorski hits back at Israel’s claim of mistaken identity, saying “they thought there was a terrorist among them, but even if there was, they seem to have been willing to sacrifice someone who was not an immediate danger”. “These are moral hazards I don’t think are acceptable,” he says, adding that he believes there is “something wrong with their rules of engagement”. Asked about what pressure Poland and its Nato allies will be putting on Israel, Sikorski says it’s important to remember the war “starts with the heinous Hamas attack on Israel”. “We recognise Israel’s right to defend itself”, he says, “but we don’t recognise the right to overuse force, and nor do we recognise the right to illegally settle Palestinian land”.
