About 50 pro-Palestinian protesters have blocked staff from entering a site run by Britain's biggest defence firm. They waved Palestinian flags and chanted pro-Palestinian slogans outside two gates at BAE Systems munitions plant in Glascoed, Monmouthshire. One banner read, "BAE stop armed genocide" while others said "Welsh weapons cause genocide" and "UK weapons kill". It is one of four blockades at sites across the UK. Many of the protesters covered their faces and said they were demonstrating against the production of weapons, and the war in Gaza. "Hopefully we can see these places shut down for good," said one, Neezo Dahan, who described himself as a human rights activist.
