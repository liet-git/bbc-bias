As heavy shelling continues in Rafah, one person who has managed to escape to safety in the past week is Daiana Albukhari. The 22-year-old crowdfunded $12,000 which enabled her to flee to Egypt, where she is currently staying with friends. She tells BBC Asian Network: When I crossed the border, the sound of drones started to disappear. I felt something is wrong because Iâ€™m out of Gaza, safe and I don't deserve to be. " The feeling of safety has come with an emotional price of leaving her family behind, who are still in Rafah. "I just feel guilty, I don't deserve all that while my people and family in that situation [are] under bombings," she says. "I left Gaza because my mum insisted on me leaving. I didn't want to. " Daiana last spoke to her family four days ago, but has "lost connection" since. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
