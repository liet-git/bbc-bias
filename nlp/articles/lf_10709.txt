T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Sports brand Puma will end its sponsorship of Israel's national football team, the Financial Times has reported . The company's decision not to renew a contract with the Israel Football Association was made a year ago, the newspaper said, citing an internal note and unnamed sources. It is said to be a decision not related to calls for a boycott and was made for financial reasons. The move means Puma will not be providing the Israeli team with kit next year. The company is also said to be discontinuing its work with other national teams such as Serbia. Puma has yet to comment. Some pro-Palestinian activists have accused the brand of supporting Israeli settlements in the West Bank, which Puma denies. In recent years, activists have staged protests outside Puma stores. The call for a boycott of the brand's products has intensified since the current war began. In January protesters in London called for a boycott over Puma's sponsorship of the Israeli Football Association. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
