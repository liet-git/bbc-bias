As calls for a resignation mount, it's worth considering whether it's even possible for a Speaker to get sacked. There’s not a formal mechanism in place for MPs to oust the Speaker from their role. Erskine May, the "bible" of parliamentary procedure, explains that a Speaker is elected, or re-elected, by MPs after every general election. And “thus elected and approved, continues in that office during the whole Parliament, unless in the meantime they resign or are removed by death”. However, there is a precedent for a Speaker being pressured into a resignation. Michael Martin, who served in the role from 2000 to 2009, stepped down after criticism of his handling of the MPs’ expenses scandal. He said his reason for standing down was to maintain the unity of the House of Commons. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
