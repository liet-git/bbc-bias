Israel's potential response to Iran's attacks could be "significant" even as the US attempts to dissuade them from widening the conflict, Mick Mulroy, a former Deputy Secretary of Defence for the Middle East, tells me. According to Mulroy, the Iranian attack could have killed "many" civilians and caused severe damage to Israeli civilian and commercial infrastructure. Mulroy adds that he believes Israel will "likely" choose to respond directly in Iran, although the US will try to de-escalate the situation before that takes place. "It could be as significant as striking suspected Iranian nuclear weapons facilities or going after their defence industrial base," he says. "If they do either or both successfully, Iran [will have] made a strategic mistake in mounting this attack," Mulroy says. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
