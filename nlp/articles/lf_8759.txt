T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. The Israeli military says it is investigating the possibility that weapons stored in a nearby compound caught fire after an Israeli air strike in Rafah on Sunday, triggering a blaze in a tent camp for displaced Palestinians that killed dozens of people. Daniel Hagari, a spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), said the munition used in the strike could not have ignited a fire of this size alone. Hagari said the strike hit a structure where two senior Hamas commanders were meeting, and said the target was outside the area that had been designated as a humanitarian zone by the Israeli military. The attack led to widespread international condemnation, with world leaders and humanitarian groups calling for an immediate ceasefire in Israelâ€™s war against Hamas in Gaza. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
