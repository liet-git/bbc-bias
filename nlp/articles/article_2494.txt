A campaign group supporting Palestine said it had vandalised the UK office of a global haulage company. Kuehne+Nagel confirmed its site in Milton Keynes was damaged early on Wednesday morning. Palestine Action said it was targeting companies that were supplying weapons to Israel.  Kuehne+Nagel declined to comment, while Thames Valley Police said it was investigating “significant criminal damage” at the site.  Palestine Action claimed that Kuehne+Nagel provides “transportation and logistics services” for arms company Elbit Systems, which had contracts with Israel’s Ministry of Defence. A Palestine Action spokesperson said group members took action because "in the past 100 days over 25,000 Palestinians were killed". The campaign group said it was “determined” to target “companies assisting in the delivery and shipment of Israeli weaponry”. Thames Valley Police said: “Officers have visited the location and engaged with the victim. We are pursuing all lines of enquiry”.
