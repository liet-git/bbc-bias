T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Tributes continue to be paid to Melbourne-born Lalzawmi "Zomi" Frankcom who was killed in the suspected Israeli air strike. We have had some more reaction from Australia's foreign minister who expressed "overwhelming sadness" on behalf of the government. Senator Penny Wong says: "Her tireless work to improve the lives of others should never have cost Ms Frankcom her own. "The government expresses its deepest sympathies to her family and loved ones, just as we mourn all civilian deaths in this conflict. " Senator Wong says the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is supporting Frankcom's family. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
