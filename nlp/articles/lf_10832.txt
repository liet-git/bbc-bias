T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. As we have been reporting this morning, Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said dozens of Hamas fighters are "laying down their weapons and handing themselves over". Images of detained and stripped Palestinians apparently surrendering some weapons to Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip have prompted speculation about the circumstances of the events and the filming. Initially, two videos of what appeared to be the same scene - a man in his underwear obeying instructions to lay down a weapon - but with slight differences, sparked speculation it may have been filmed repeatedly for separate "takes". BBC Verify has examined the footage and established that both clips came from a continuous sequence in which three guns in total appear to be handed over. But, questions remain about the exact circumstances and the release of the videos. You can read the full BBC Verify analysis here. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
