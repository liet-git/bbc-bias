As we await the hearing in the Hague, there appears to be some progress on diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict in Gaza. US reports say that the CIA director, William Burns is due to meet Israeli, Qatari and Egyptian officials in Europe in the coming days to try to advance talks on a new deal for a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of hostages held by Hamas. These talks – which haven’t been officially confirmed – are being seen as further evidence that what the White House has described as “sober” and “serious” efforts are under way to bring about a new ceasefire and hostage release deal. Significantly, they involve players who were key to sealing a previous agreement in November. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
