As well as reports of Israeli tanks in the centre of Rafah, footage from this morning on Arabic-language Telegram channels shows tread marks from tanks in western Rafah . The video from which the below still was taken shows damage to the surface of Abu Baker Al Seddeq road, in front of the Temraz petrol station - approximately 3km west of al-Awda roundabout , and 300m from the Indonesian Field Hospital, which was damaged overnight. The camera also turns left to show smoke rising in the centre of town. We can be confident the video was filmed this morning, as no other copies of it had been recorded by Google as of midday (BST, 2pm in Gaza). Plus, the cloudy weather is a match for today as recent days have had minimal cloud cover in Rafah. Tread mark damage on the Abu Baker Al Seddeq road, Tal as Sultan, Rafah, morning of 28 May.
