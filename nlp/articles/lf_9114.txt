We reported earlier that 14 people, including nine children, had been killed in a blast west of Khan Younis, according to the Hamas-run health ministry - and there's some more detail now. Health officials in Gaza say the blasts were in al-Mawasi and were the result of Israeli airstrikes. The Israeli military hasn't commented on this specific incident, but we've gone to them for comment. Al-Mawasi, an 8.5 sq km (3.3 sq mile) strip of land by the Mediterranean Sea, was designated safe by the Israeli military last month. Millions of Palestinians had been told to flee for safety to the area, which is smaller than London's Heathrow Airport. Nahed Abu Taime, a doctor at the Nasser hospital in southern Khan Younis, where the dead and wounded were taken, tells Reuters they received the bodies of 16 people, "some of whom were residents from al-Mawasi area". "53 injured people [have] arrived since midnight," he adds. You can read more about al-Mawasi here. A crater is seen in the small region of al-Mawasi, where millions of displaced Palestinians have been told to flee. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
