In our previous post, we reported on Israel's announcement that it has killed a senior Hezbollah commander - but you may be wondering what that attack has to do with the war in Gaza. Hezbollah, a Shia Muslim organisation based in Lebanon, has deep ties to Hamas. It was established in the early 1980s by the most dominant Shia power in the Middle East - Iran - to oppose Israel. At the time, Israel's forces had occupied southern Lebanon during the country's civil war.
