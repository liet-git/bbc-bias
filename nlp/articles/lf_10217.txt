It's just gone 08:00 in Israel and Gaza, and 06:00 in London. The ground incursion into Gaza's second city , Khan Younis, has been intensifying as Israel pounds the area. Internet and phone networks across the Palestinian territory again went down yesterday, according to the region's main telecoms company. A key moment to watch today will be when US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan heads to the occupied West Bank city of Ramallah for talks with Palestinian Authority leaders . Sullivan yesterday met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who said Israel would continue its war effort until "absolute victory" . Washington has strongly supported Israel's right to defend itself following the Hamas attacks in October but the scale of civilian casualties in Gaza has caused growing tension between the close allies . Also in the West Bank, video has emerged of Israeli soldiers singing and praying into a microphone at a mosque in Jenin - prompting the defence spokesman to warn "anyone who does not conduct themselves according to IDF values will face corresponding measures".
