T-I-T-L-E-E-N-D.  T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Israel will appear before the International Court of Justice to contest South Africa's allegations of genocide over the war with Hamas in Gaza, according to an Israeli government spokesman. South Africa's application , submitted to the Hague on Friday, stated that the "acts and omissions by Israel" are "genocidal in character because they are intended to bring about the destruction of a substantial part of the Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group". In an online briefing this morning, Israeli government spokesperson Eylon Levy says Israel will appear before the ICJ "to dispel South Africa's absurd blood libel". "We assure South Africa's leaders, history will judge you, and it will judge you without mercy," he adds. South Africa, which has been a staunch supporter of Palestinians, has been highly critical of Israel's military operation in Gaza. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
