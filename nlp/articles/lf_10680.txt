 F-N-S-T-A-R-T. 10680 F-N-E-N-D.  D-A-T-E-S-T-A-R-T. 2023-12-12 D-A-T-E-E-N-D.  T-I-T-L-E-S-T-A-R-T. A stronger General Assembly resolution than before. T-I-T-L-E-E-N-D.  T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. This is the second time during this crisis that the UN General Assembly is holding a vote in direct response to the US paralysing the Security Council with its veto - most recently on Friday when it blocked a resolution demanding an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. That move by the US was criticised by several rights groups and renewed questions about the declining role of the Security Council in maintaining peace and security. General Assembly resolutions may not be binding, but they do reflect global opinion. And right now, the majority of the world looks set to make clear that an urgent humanitarian ceasefire is essential. In October, 121 nations supported a General Assembly resolution calling for a humanitarian truce - only 14 nations voted against it and 44 members abstained. The vote isolated the US and Israel and exposed divisions in the stance of the EU and wider West. This new resolution is much stronger in its language and now, like the Security Council failed text, demands a humanitarian ceasefire. The expectation is it will garner even greater support. The Palestinian ambassador to the UN, Riyad Mansour, says he hopes it sends a message to Washington and others “protecting and shielding” Israel. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
