T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Let's bring you some remarks from America's top diplomat, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who has been speaking to reporters in Washington as part of an end-of-year briefing at the State Department. He says the US continues to focus on a number of priorities in the Middle East and believes Israel has an obligation to both remove Hamas and minimise the civilian death toll in Gaza. Blinken says the US wants to ensure hostages get home and that the conflict should not spread.
