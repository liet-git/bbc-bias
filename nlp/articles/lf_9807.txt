There’s a sense of relief in the wider region that what could have been an escalation of the conflict between Israel and Iran has seemed to have dissipated. The promised Israeli response was very limited in its extent. There’s been no official response from the Israeli government itself, and it looks like, for the time being, that side of things seems to have calmed down. Maybe a red line has been drawn under that, although Iran’s allies in the region, particularly Hezbollah, in southern Lebanon, do still have the capacity to attack Israeli positions and of course, we’ve seen the Houthis from Yemen do the same. So there is still tension and a threat between Israel and Iran. What is still happening, and what did happen overnight, is that the more than six-month long war in Gaza is intensifying. Israel has made it clear it will launch a full-scale military operation in the southern city of Rafah. The Americans and the British are trying to warn Israel against that. I don’t think it’s going to happen in the next few days because we’ve got the Jewish holiday of Passover starting over the weekend. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
