Residents in the central Iranian province of Isfahan recorded the sounds of explosions overnight, which Iranian state media has attributed to air defence missiles hitting three drones. Reports suggest the attack was close to an airport and military base. Officials claim there has been no major damage.

Some reports suggest air-launched missiles had been involved. Iran appeared to play down the incident, with one official quoted as saying there were no plans for retaliation.
