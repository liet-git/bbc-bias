US President Joe Biden has met around a dozen family members of Americans held hostage by Hamas, the AFP news agency is reporting. The meeting - Biden's first in-person with the relatives - took place at the White House, officials say, with Secretary of State Antony Blinken also present. Before the meeting, a senior official told Reuters that the group included relatives of all eight Americans still unaccounted for. Four US citizens were released in the seven-day truce last month.
