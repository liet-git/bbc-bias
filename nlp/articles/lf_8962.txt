We are now hearing from Nato's Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg . Laura starts by asking him about the idea he has been floating of a multi-billion euro package of military support, potentially €100bn, for five years, to help Ukraine. Stoltenberg confirms this will be new and extra money, and demonstrate a long-term commitment to Ukraine. Nato is currently discussing different ways of organising this, he says. Asked how confident he is all allies will agree it, Stoltenberg says he is confident because “all allies agree that we should start planning for a stronger Nato role”, adding there is “no way” to avoid this cost. He says: “So what we are discussing is not whether to pay, there’s no way to run away from that cost, but how to pay. ”. Jens Stoltenberg speaking with Laura Kuenssberg. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
