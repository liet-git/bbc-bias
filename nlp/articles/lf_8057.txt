Sir Ed Davey , the leader of the Liberal Democrats, is saying his party will continue to back Sir Lindsay Hoyle in the aftermath of yesterday's Commons row. Speaking to Sky News earlier this afternoon, Davey said he thought yesterday's walkout by SNP and Conservative MPs "did not show Parliament in a good light". He says his party will continue to back the Speaker of the House and that he made his decision "in good faith". "Liberal Democrats have confidence in Speaker Hoyle. I think he was in a very difficult position. " Davey says that Hoyle had to take into account fears over the "the security and safety of MPs" and that he believes he handled himself "very professionally". The Lib Dem leader went on to say that some parties were now "trying to make political gain" out of the Commons row. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
