Dr Haya Hijazi was a gynaecologist in Tal al-Hawa, now living in a tent on the Egypt-Rafah border. The 28-year-old gynaecologist used to work at Al-Shifa hospital until early October. When her neighbourhood was targeted by Israeli forces, she fled the North to her sister’s home in the centre of Gaza, then had to flee again to the south. Dr Haya has tried to provide free consultations to women since the beginning of the war. She has been active in gathering donations through her social media, and has used them to purchase medicines and sanitary products for women in Gaza. “A typical day for me starts with the search for clean water. Then I look for flour so we can bake, and wood to light a fire so we can eat. I try to come up with new initiatives through which I can help people, and every day I volunteer at a nearby medical station to help patients,” she told us. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
