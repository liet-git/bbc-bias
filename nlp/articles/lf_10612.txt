US national security adviser Jake Sullivan has held talks with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman during a visit to Saudi Arabia. Discussions focussed on the Israel-Gaza war and other regional issues, including efforts to deter Houthi attacks against commercial vessels in the Red Sea. The news agency Reuters quotes an official saying the pair discussed efforts to "maintain stability across the region and prevent the Israel-Hamas conflict from expanding". The official adds that Sullivan aimed to build on work already under way to try to create sustainable peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians. The national security adviser is now expected to travel to Israel, where he will spend Thursday and Friday holding talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and members of the war cabinet. Here, they're expected to discuss the need for Israel to be more surgical and precise with their strikes against Hamas targets, a spokesperson says. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
