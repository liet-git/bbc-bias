Our live page covering the latest updates in the Israel-Gaza war will be pausing shortly, but before we go here's a quick summary of what's been happening today. Israel's military has ordered more people in areas of Rafah , in southern Gaza, to evacuate to western parts of the Gaza Strip. The call comes as Israel intensifies its operation in the city , and claims to have had face-to-face battles with Hamas there. Hours before the order, the US said Israel may have breached international law with US weapons in Gaza. About 300,000 Gazans have moved towards al-Mawasi since Monday, the IDF has said. UN humanitarian agencies say they will run out of food for south Gaza today, after the closure of Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings. At least 34,971 people have been killed in Gaza since the 7 October attacks, the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry has said today.
