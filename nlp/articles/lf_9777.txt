Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has staked his remaining political reputation on destroying Hamas as an operational force capable of launching attacks on Israel. But he’s also under enormous pressure to bring home more than 130 Israeli hostages still being held inside Gaza – and the best chance of that probably lies in a ceasefire deal with Hamas. And so, Netanyahu is sending a delegation to Qatar to resume indirect talks with Hamas leaders, while his army enters al-Shifa Hospital in search of Hamas fighters. He is adamant that any ceasefire will be temporary, and that Israel will continue with plans for a military operation in the southern town of Rafah, currently sheltering more than a million displaced Palestinians. The prospect of a pause in the fighting, alongside the promise of a major military campaign: two different strategies for two different goals. The trick Netanyahu will be hoping to pull off is stopping each of these strategies knocking the other off course. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
