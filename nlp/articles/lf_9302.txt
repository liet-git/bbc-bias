The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) Mirjana Spoljaric, who visited Gaza on Monday, has responded to criticism of their role in facilitating the release of Israeli hostages. She told the BBC's Newshour: "[The hostages are] at the very top of our priority list - but under current circumstances access is difficult and very dangerous for the hostages themselves. "It requires an agreement between both the parties and that agreement is lacking at the moment. We speak to both sides all the time and we are demanding that Hamas gives us access - from day one I have always clearly said that taking hostages is against international humanitarian law. " A phrase that has gained some traction on social media in Israel is that the ICRC is a mere "uber service" for the hostages. She responded: "This is profoundly unjust, unfair, and wrong - these operations are extremely complex and have to be planned - we are working around the clock with the authorities on the Israeli side and Israel knows that we use all our available resources whenever we can facilitate a release or access to hostages.
