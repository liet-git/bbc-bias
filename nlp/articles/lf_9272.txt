As we've been reporting, Israel has attacked a call by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres for a "humanitarian ceasefire". Guterres warned that the humanitarian system in Gaza could collapse and called on the UN Security Council to avert a "catastrophe". Now the EU's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, has asked European states to back Guterres. "I ask the EU members of the UN Security Council and like-minded partners to support @UN Secretary General @AntonioGuterres â€™s call," he posted on X . "The #UNSC must act immediately to prevent a full collapse of the humanitarian situation in Gaza. " France and Malta are the only two EU states among the 15 which make up the current Security Council . Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen had said on X that Guterres' "call for a ceasefire in Gaza constitutes support of the Hamas terrorist organization". T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
