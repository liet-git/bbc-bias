T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. US President Joe Biden's pressure on Israel after last week's deadly attack on aid workers did not go far enough and will fail to stem the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, according to current and former US officials who have spoken to the BBC. They said internal dissent in government was growing and called for tougher action on arms transfers. Israel said it would open new aid routes after Biden threatened to reassess policy following Israeli strikes that killed seven workers from food charity World Central Kitchen (WCK), including a US-Canadian citizen. But the tougher line was "too little, too late", said Annelle Sheline, an official working in human rights who quit the state department in protest a fortnight ago. She said the White House "could have done this months ago and prevented famine in northern Gaza". The US-Israel relationship is currently experiencing its most serious strain in decades, after Biden's phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week that amounted to a defining moment in the six-month conflict.
