In the UK, a spokeswoman for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak says he has still not spoken to his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu, despite saying yesterday that he would talk to him "shortly". "We are still discussing scheduling, working out with diaries," she said. "The prime minister has regularly spoken with Netanyahu. It does take time to schedule these with diaries but there was a suggestion earlier this morning that that meant that the UK's view was not being relayed or we hadn't had an opportunity to do that. " She added: "That is obviously incorrect. Our position is very clear, it's the same as the US and we obviously have contact with the Israeli government through many different channels.
