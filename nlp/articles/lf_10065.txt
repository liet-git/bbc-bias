Dr Lina Khatib, an associate fellow at Chatham House, has told BBC Radio 5 Live that Iran’s attack was “meant to be a kind of spectacle that Iran wanted the world to witness”. Dr Khatib, who is currently in Lebanon, has said it was “highly choreographed” and “actually quite limited”. She referenced Iran issuing a statement that it considered the retaliation “computed” before the drones reached their targets in Israel. “So this shows that Iran just wanted to send a very strong message, to save face, so that it is seen as having responded directly to Israel, but at the same time it definitely does not want the matter to escalate any further. ”.
