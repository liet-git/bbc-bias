Israeli government spokesman Eylon Levy has called on the US and other allies to "stand by us as we push for total victory over Hamas". Speaking at a press conference, Levy insisted that the US and Israel were "fully aligned" on their mission to destroy Hamas, and that the US shared Israel's belief that Hamas was "pure evil". Responding to a question on whether the US was putting pressure on Israel to bring the war to an end, Levy said: "The only clock that matters is that every second Hamas still exists after (7 October). It is a ticking time bomb that we must defuse or it will explode in our faces again. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
