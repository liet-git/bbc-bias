Israel has been under pressure to do more to protect civilians in Gaza as it continues with its offensive against Hamas. Even its main ally, the US, says there is a “gap” in what the Israeli authorities say and what they are doing - in the words of Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Still, the US vetoed a UN Security Council resolution calling for a ceasefire last night, supporting the Israeli view that a pause now would only benefit Hamas. Thirteen other members of the council backed the resolution, while the UK abstained in the vote - proof of growing international concerns about the desperate humanitarian situation in Gaza. Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian envoy to the UN, said the vote meant that “millions of Palestinian lives hang in the balance” - a position shared by aid groups who have repeatedly warned of an unfolding catastrophe. The entire territory, under constant bombardment, is suffering with widespread shortages of food, water and medicine. Overwhelmed hospitals are unable to treat everyone, and shelters cannot cope with tens of thousands of displaced residents, many on the move not for the first time. The limited amount of basic supplies being allowed into Gaza means that humanitarian assistance in the territory has virtually stopped, according to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees. Israel says it has taken measures to protect civilians, and accuses Hamas of using the population of human shields. As the fighting continues, more people will get killed, and the suffering of those who survive will only get worse. For the US, it may be a matter of time before calls for a ceasefire become too loud to be ignored. Bodies of Palestinians have been buried in available areas of the Gaza Strip. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
