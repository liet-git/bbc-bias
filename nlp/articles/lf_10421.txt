At the student protests, anger is not reserved solely for the universities. Many are also angry at the US government and President Joe Biden - whom they see as complicit with Israel's war in Gaza. I just got off the phone with Chisato Mimura, a law student and protest leader from Yale. She told me that many students at Yale's encampment blame Biden - a thought I've also heard here at Columbia and from other campuses. "The US is quite literally funding and equipping the weapons used in genocide," she said. "The federal government, Biden, the White House, could act. " "But instead, what they're doing is completely putting their full weight behind it," she added. "We are well aware of the prominent role they are playing. " Following a case brought by South Africa the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has found that that Palestinians had “plausible rights to protection from genocide” - rights which were at a real risk of irreparable damage. Israel strenuously denies any suggestion it is committing genocide in Gaza. Here at Columbia, another student - who asked to remain anonymous - said he believed the protest movement would hurt Biden at the polls. "These guys are pretty liberal, mostly," he said. "But nobody will vote for him while the war is still going. " Update 21 May: This post has been amended to clarify the context behind the ICJ’s use of the word “plausible” in its ruling on 26 January. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
