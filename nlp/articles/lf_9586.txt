Let's catch up on some more comments from the Irish PM, Simon Harris, in Dublin. "From our own history, we know what it [recognition] means," he says, referring to Ireland's independence from Britain in the 20th Century. He describes the Hamas attack on 7 October as "barbaric", and calls "again for all hostages to be immediately returned to the arms of their loved ones". "But let me also be clear, Hamas is not the Palestinian people. Today's decision to recognise Palestine is taken to help create a peaceful future. "A two-state solution is the only way out of the generational cycles of violence, retaliation and resentment. . . "Just as Ireland's recognition as a state eventually led to the establishment of our now peaceful republic, we believe that Palestinian statehood will contribute to peace and to reconciliation in the Middle East.
