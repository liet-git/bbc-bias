The conversations between the UK and Israel in the past day have been far from business as usual. The Israeli ambassador was summoned to the Foreign Office for the first time in 12 years. And Rishi Sunak’s conversation with his Israeli counterpart last night was frank. Sunak told Benjamin Netanyahu that he was “appalled” at the killings, that too many aid workers and civilians had died and the situation was “increasingly intolerable”. That sort of language is not what you’d expect from an official readout between two allies. And we’ve seen similar frustration from other countries who are typically supportive of Israel. The pressure on Netanyahu is growing. The UK has also made it clear it wants more protection for civilians, fewer restrictions on aid and more done to repair vital infrastructure like hospitals. The government in London is likely to wait and see whether Israel delivers on demands for an independent, transparent and thorough investigation. But the relationship is showing signs of strain – as is Israel’s relationship with other allies. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
