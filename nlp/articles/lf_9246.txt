When Thai avocado farm worker Anucha Angkaew and and five of his colleagues found themselves face-to-face with 10 Hamas attackers on 7 October, they shouted "Thailand, Thailand", hoping they'd be spared. But that didn't work. Two of them were shot dead, and the others were forcibly taken to Gaza. "I lost my friend in front of my eyes," Anucha said in an interview with Reuters news agency. He's now back at his family home in the rural north-east of Thailand, after spending 50 days in captivity. But he's haunted by memories of having his hands tied behind his back, being punched and kicked by Hamas captors and sleeping on a bare sandy floor. The group – as well as two Israeli men – were taken to a small building leading to a tunnel and stayed in a room where they were given flatbread twice a day and shared two bottles of water per day. After four days, they were taken to another room inside the tunnel. It was more spacious, Anucha says, and the beatings stopped. It had lightbulbs and they got better food, including nuts, butter and rice. One day a guard left behind a pen, so they started marking the time and managed to sketch a chessboard to pass the hours. Anucha dreamed of soi ju, a Thai raw beef delicacy in spicy sauce. The group had no idea of the intense Israeli bombardment going on above their heads, he says. When they were finally released, "it was like I was reborn". Hamas - designated a terrorist organisation in the UK, US and other Western countries - has not responded to Reuters' request for a comment. Anucha is back at his family home in Thailand now.
