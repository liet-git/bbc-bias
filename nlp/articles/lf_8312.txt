Israel has accused Hamas of proposing "delusional" demands in ongoing negotiations over a ceasefire in Gaza. The office for Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement that Hamas had rejected any compromise on its demands. “Israel will not surrender to Hamas’ delusional demands and will continue to act to achieve all the goals of the war: releasing all the hostages, destroying Hamas’ military and governing capabilities and ensuring that Gaza will never again be a threat to Israel," it said. Hours after a UN Security Council resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire and the release of Israeli hostages was passed on Monday, Hamas said it would stick to its original demands for a more permanent ceasefire, which include the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and a return of displaced Palestinians.
