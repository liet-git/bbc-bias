The convoy carrying seven World Central Kitchen (WCK) aid workers should never have been attacked, says the Director General of the World Health Organization, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. He said the convoy was clearly marked with the WCK logo, adding that "hungry people will go unfed" because the charity paused their operations after the incident. Dr Tedros added that his organisation continues to work in Gaza "under extreme danger". He called for a better deconfliction system so that aid convoys can move safely, and for more entry points into northern Gaza. Palestinians gathering to receive aid in Gaza City last month.
