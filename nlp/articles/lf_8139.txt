Sir Lindsay Hoyle is back in the House to respond to very vocal complaints of his handling of this debate. "I wanted to do the best by every member of the house," he says. "I regret how it's ended up. It was not my intention. I wanted all to ensure they could express their views. As it was, in particularly the SNP, were unable to vote on their own proposition. "It is with my sadness that it ended in this position. It was never my intention. I recognise the strength of feeling of this house and its members. I will reflect on my part in that. I do not want it to have ended like this. " He says he will "meet all key players" in the coming hours on what is the best way forward. "I thought I was doing the right thing. I do take responsibility for my actions. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
