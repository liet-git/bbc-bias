We'll be closing this live page soon so here's a look at what's been happening today: Eyewitnesses and local journalists in Rafah have reported that Israeli tanks have seized control of the al-Awda roundabout, which is a key landmark housing major banks, government institutions, businesses, and shops. The Hamas-run health ministry says a total of 21 people have been killed and 64 injured in a strike on a displaced persons camp in west Rafah this afternoon. The IDF denies striking the humanitarian area in Al-Mawasi today. It comes after at least 45 Palestinians were killed in an Israeli air strike in Rafah on Sunday. Israel called Sunday's strike a "tragic mishap" and faced widespread international condemnation. But the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) now say weapons stored near the camp could have been responsible for the extent of the blaze, adding that it was "too early to determine" the cause of the fire. Meanwhile, Spain, Ireland and Norway all officially recognised a Palestinian state - despite a furious reaction from Israel. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
