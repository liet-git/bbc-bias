According to the UN, just over 75% of Gaza's population - some 1.7 million people - were already registered refugees before Israel warned Palestinians to leave northern Gaza. Palestinian refugees are defined by the UN as people whose "place of residence was Palestine during the period 1 June 1946 to 15 May 1948, and who lost both home and means of livelihood as a result of the 1948 War". More than 500,000 of the refugee population lived in eight crowded camps located across the Strip. Following Israel's warnings after 7 October, many of those refugees joined the hundreds of thousands of people forced to flee their homes, the UN says. About 1.7 million Palestinians are now gathered in emergency shelters or informal sites set up nearby. On average, before the conflict, there were more than 5,700 people per sq km in Gaza - very similar to the average density in London. The UN says more than half of Gaza's population is now crammed into Rafah - a town of originally 250,000 people. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
