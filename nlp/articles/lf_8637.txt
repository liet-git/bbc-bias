Israel's aim in assassinating Hamas's deputy leader was also a strategic move to weaken the network between Hamas and Iranian-backed Hezbollah - that's the view of Anshel Pfeffer, a writer with the Israeli newspaper Haaretz. Pfeffer says with any removal of a senior Hamas figure there will always be a replacement, but al-Arouri was a particularly significant figure as he worked as a co-ordinator between the two groups. "Hamas is not going to go away just because one senior commander has been assassinated," says Pfeffer. He describes Hamas as "a movement which is organic to Palestinian society". But he says a short-term objective of disrupting the alliance has been achieved. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
