Let's just recap what US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said a little earlier about the language used in the UN Security Council draft resolution. "There seems to be silence on what Hamas could do, should do, must do if we want to end the suffering of innocent men, women and children. It would be good if the world could unite around that proposition as well," he told journalists at his final briefing of 2023. "The purpose of the resolution as stated by the countries that put it forward is to facilitate and help expand humanitarian assistance that's getting into Gaza. And we fully support that. "We want to make sure that the resolution in what it calls for and requires actually advances that effort and doesn't do anything that could actually hurt the delivery of humanitarian assistance, make it more complicated. " About an hour after Blinken's comments, we found out the UN Security Council vote on the resolution had been delayed again. It's now scheduled for Thursday morning local time. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
