T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Amy Callaghan, an SNP MP says that "the only way to guarantee, not only the safety of the Palestinian population in Gaza, but also the immediate release of hostages is immediate ceasefire". "Time for us all to show moral courage and recognise that the only way to give an end to the suffering is by voting for an immediate ceasefire," Callaghan says. She gives some examples from Gaza to explain why an immediate ceasefire is needed: "We saw hospitals bombed, premature babies dying in incubators, white phosphorous falling from the sky , now we are seeing a death toll of almost 30,000 civilians, mostly women and children. "Surely they know tonight they all have to back a ceasefire. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
