T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. The US Central Command says a commercial tanker was hit by a cruise missile fired from Yemen, in territory controlled by Iranian-backed Houthi rebels. It says the strike, which happened on Monday, caused a fire on the Strinda vessel as it was passing through the Bab-el-Mandeb strait that connects the Red Sea to the Gulf of Aden. There were no casualties. A US Navy destroyer has provided assistance. Separately, a British maritime agency says it has received a report of a vessel being ordered to change its course and sail to an unspecified Yemeni port. It is not clear whether the two incidents relate to the same ship. The Houthi movement has said it will target all ships heading north to Israel, and has warned international shipping companies against dealing with Israeli ports. We'll bring you further updates once we get more information. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
