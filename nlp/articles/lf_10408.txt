Good morning and welcome to our live coverage. You join us as Israel's military has started what it is calling a "limited and temporary" evacuation of civilians from parts of eastern Rafah in southern Gaza, where more than 1.4 million people have sought refuge. About 100,000 people in the eastern part of the city, closest to the Israeli border, are being urged to move to expanded humanitarian zones in the al-Mawasi and Khan Younis areas. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) says tents, food, water, and medication are available. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted that a military operation in Rafah is necessary to defeat Hamas's remaining fighters, but there has been widespread international concern over the fate of the civilians sheltering there. It comes as talks aimed at securing a ceasefire deal in Gaza and the release of hostages have stalled. Our teams in London and across the Middle East will be bringing you live updates and analysis throughout the day, so stay with us. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
