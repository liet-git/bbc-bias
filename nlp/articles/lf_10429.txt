Minnesota Democratic congresswoman Ilhan Omar has arrived on the campus at Columbia University in New York. Omar's daughter, Isra Hirsi, 21, was among a group of pro-Palestinian protesters who were cleared from the university by police last week. Hirsi says she was suspended from Columbia's sister college, Barnard, for "standing in solidarity with Palestinians". It's been relatively quiet so far on Thursday on Columbia's South Lawn. Protesters are sitting out in front of their tents on the encampment, some listening to stories of those killed in the Israel-Gaza conflict read to them by their fellow students. Another group of students has been circling in the square chanting "disclose, divest, we will not stop, we will not rest" and "our student rights are under attack, what do we do, stand up fight back". On a wall overlooking the encampment is a line of photos, under wilting roses, of Israelis held captive by Hamas. Ilhan Omar (file photo) T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
