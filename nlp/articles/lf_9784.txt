EU foreign policy chief Joseph Borrell says he is confident the bloc will agree sanctions on both Hamas and violent Israeli West Bank settlers today. The EU has so far struggled to agree sanctions against those responsible for attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank, with the US and UK having already imposed similar measures. Agreement is now expected after Hungary, a close ally of the Israeli government, reportedly signalled its support, having previously been blamed for holding up sanctions on settlers in the West Bank. Further sanctions against Hamas are also expected. Speaking to reporters in Brussels, Borrell says: "It seems that today all will agree on putting sanctions on both Hamas and the violent settlers who are harassing Palestinians in the West Bank.
