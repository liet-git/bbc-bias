"The relentless pressure on Hamas and the position of strength from which we come into this campaign, allow us flexibility and freedom of action,” he said during an address to a group of newly-drafted soldiers, according to the AFP news agency. Talks towards a deal for a temporary ceasefire continue in Egypt via Egyptian and Qatari mediators. "There will be difficult decisions and we will be ready to pay the price in order to get the hostages back, and then return to fighting,” Gallant said. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
