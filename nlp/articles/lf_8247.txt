Flynn says that tonight, the House will have the opportunity to "join with the majority of the international community to say that enough is enough, killing in Gaza must stop, and hostages must be released". He adds that the "best way to do that is to send a clear and united message that we back an immediate ceasefire". Sunak answers by saying that the government also wants to see the fighting in Gaza end as soon as possible "and never again allow Hamas to carry out terrorist attacks". "But just calling for an immediate ceasefire is not in anyone's interest," he adds. Sunak insists that the UK is committed to their position, which is to work towards a permanent ceasefire, and a "humanitarian pause to get hostages out and get the aid in". T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
