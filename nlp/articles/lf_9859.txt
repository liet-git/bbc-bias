T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Prince Khalid bin Bandar Al Saud, the Saudi Arabian ambassador to the UK, has been speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He says there is "no perfect immediate solution" to how Gaza will be governed when Israel's operation there ends. Asked what role Saudi Arabia - which was close to normalising diplomatic relations with Israel before 7 October - could play in the Palestinian territories in the future, he says is is not possible to plan without a ceasefire. But he adds the Palestinian Authority - which governs parts of the West Bank - would likely need international support if it moved into Gaza. "How that is made up, where it comes from, that has to be in discussion with the Palestinians, the international community, and without question you can't do it without the Israelis accepting it," he says. Asked if he thought Hamas could be involved in governing a future Palestinian state, he indicates they could in certain circumstances, adding: "If there's no compromise, there's no solution.
