As we prepare to wrap up our live coverage, here is a summary of the day's main events: The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has ruled that Israel must take all measures to prevent genocidal acts in Gaza, but it stopped short of ordering an immediate ceasefire. South Africa, which brought the case, along with Palestinian officials and human rights groups, are celebrating the result of the ruling. But Israel says South Africa has failed in its main objective to force a ceasefire. PM Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel will "continue to defend ourselves and our citizens while adhering to international law" Meanwhile, US media report that the head of the CIA is due to meet Israeli, Qatari and Egyptian officials in the coming days to discuss a new potential ceasefire in Gaza. This all comes as allegations emerge that UN aid workers may have been involved in the 7 October attack s by Hamas in Israel. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
