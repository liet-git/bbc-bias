As the sun rose, thousands of Palestinians were seen leaving the Tal al-Sultan neighbourhood using cars, trucks and carts drawn by donkeys and horses, heading north. Khaled Mahmoud, a resident of Tal al-Sultan in western Rafah, expressed his distress. "The explosions are rattling our tent, my children are frightened, and my sick father makes it impossible for us to escape the darkness. "We are supposed to be in a safe zone according to the Israeli army's standards, yet we have not received evacuation orders like those in the eastern region, we fear for our lives if no one steps in to protect us," Mahmoud said. A harrowing video shared on social media captured a woman rushing through a dark street, clutching her child tightly to escape the ongoing Israeli attacks. A local journalist at the Kuwaiti Hospital in Tal Al-Sultan, amidst the relentless bombings, reported that numerous families sought refuge in the medical centre's courtyard, while ambulances struggled to reach the affected areas due to the severity of the situation.
