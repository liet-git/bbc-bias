 F-N-S-T-A-R-T. 8181 F-N-E-N-D.  D-A-T-E-S-T-A-R-T. 2024-02-21 D-A-T-E-E-N-D.  T-I-T-L-E-S-T-A-R-T. 'Silence is tacit acceptance of Israel's actions' - Nicolson. T-I-T-L-E-E-N-D.  T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. SNP MP John Nicolson is now speaking. He says Gaza is in ruins and that women are having to endure caesareans without anaesthetics, "yet this House has been paralysed". Innocent people, children and babies "not remotely responsible for the atrocities carried out by evil Hamas" are being slaughtered, he says, which he adds is the definition of collective punishment. He says the Commons cannot force Netanyahu to stop the bombings but the point is that they can apply pressure, adding that "silence is tacit acceptance of Israel's actions". The SNP's motion was not about embarrassing pollical opponents, as some have suggested, Nicolson says, and that "not everything is about Britain". He says he won't speak for colleagues cross-party but says some have lost their front bench jobs because they can't "in good conscience remain silent" and says he hopes the majority of MPs now feel the same. "If we don't call for an immediate ceasefire now, when will we call for an immediate ceasefire," he asks the House. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
