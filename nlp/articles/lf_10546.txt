T-I-T-L-E-E-N-D.  T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Rafah has experienced more intense bombardments over the past 24 hours than the last two weeks combined, an aid worker in the region has told the BBC. Louise Wateridge, a communications officer at the UN aid agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, says this has continued with "frequency this morning a couple of miles away in the east of Rafah”. Wateridge says the building she is in, in western Rafah, is “shaking intermittently from the nearby bombardments” and that she can see vehicles leaving the area from the window, carrying displaced families. There are people in Rafah who are “unable to move very far because of elderly parents or young children”, she says. “Space available elsewhere is very minimal, has little infrastructure and as everywhere in the Gaza Strip carries no certainty of any safety”, Wateridge adds. Wateridge says she filmed the above video while driving through western Rafah at around 07:00 this morning. Displaced families continue to flee Rafah. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
