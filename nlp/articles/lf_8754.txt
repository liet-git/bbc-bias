Despite the destruction of most of the universities in the Gaza Strip since the start of the war on 7 October, one local master's student is not giving up hope. Dr Imad al-Kahlout, a professor from al-Azhar University, told BBC Arabic’s Gaza Today programme a thesis by the student - who has not been named - had been discussed in a displacement camp in the southern city of Rafah. “This discussion was for a master’s thesis, the first of its kind in light of the war on Gaza, and in light of the absence and complete cessation of the educational process," he said. Al-Kahlout stressed that "it was not just a discussion of a scientific thesis, but rather. . . a message to the world that education is one of the pillars of life, societal growth and construction". "We want to say that we will never leave our land, and that education will not stop despite the demolition, bombing, and destruction of all components of educational life and the destruction of the university buildings of al-Azhar University and other universities," he added.
