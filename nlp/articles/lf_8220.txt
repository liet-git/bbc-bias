 F-N-S-T-A-R-T. 8220 F-N-E-N-D.  D-A-T-E-S-T-A-R-T. 2024-02-21 D-A-T-E-E-N-D.  T-I-T-L-E-S-T-A-R-T. Fury in the Commons, while Starmer avoids potential rebellion. T-I-T-L-E-E-N-D.  T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. I am sitting in the gallery looking over the House of Commons where roughly two-thirds of MPs are absolutely furious with the Speaker. The noise from the chamber is deafening with the SNP and the Conservatives livid at Sir Lindsay Hoyle . Labour MPs sit quietly in their seats. That is because the Speaker will allow votes on the Labour amendment and the government one, as well, to the SNP motion. That is highly unusual to allow an opposition party – in this case Labour – to amend a motion from another opposition party. “Disgrace,” shouted one SNP MP. “Bring back Bercow,” shouted a Tory MP, referring to the previous holder of the speaker's post, John Bercow. “You ought to be ashamed of yourself,” said another. The reason they are so annoyed is it means Sir Keir Starmer can avoid a potentially damaging rebellion. He can now tell his MPs to back Labour’s wording. If Labour’s amendment was not selected, some Labour MPs would have been tempted to back the SNP’s wording calling for an “immediate ceasefire”. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
