Today we've been hearing from humanitarian agencies stationed in Gaza about what is happening on the ground there. Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN Palestinian refugee agency, UNRWA, says the ability of his agency to help is on the "verge of collapse". More than 130 staff from the agency have died in Gaza, he says. Meanwhile a spokesperson for the Palestinian Red Crescent - Nibal Farsakh - tells the BBC the lack of basic provisions and healthcare services is putting the people of Gaza in a perilous situation. "The whole population are suffering from hunger, people are lacking food, water, electricity and medicine, as well as fuel," he says. He says the health system has "literally collapsed" and the few hospitals that are operating have been overwhelmed by the "alarming numbers of casualties". Philippe Lazzarini heads the UNWRA.
