Every day, Sham and her family wait anxiously for two words from relatives left in Gaza: "We're OK". The 16-year-old, from Gaza, lives in London and says, since war broke out, 42 members of her family have been killed in the Strip. As for her surviving relatives, Sham waits daily for news that they're still alive. But "that's all we get", she tells BBC Asian Network. "We can't ask them more questions because they don't have any internet to answer us. " Sham is trying to continue life as normal while studying for her GCSEs, but says the conflict is making that difficult. "Before the war, I studied every day," she says. "After October I stopped, because of what's going on. I can't focus. " As talks resume between Israel and Hamas, with the aim of securing a ceasefire, Sham is hopeful for peace. "I just want the war to stop," she says. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
