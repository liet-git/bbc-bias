I just spoke to Minnesota congresswoman Ilhan Omar, a vocal critic of Israel whose daughter was suspended from Barnard College last week after being arrested at a demonstration. In response to a question from the BBC, Omar said she believes it was Columbia's move a week ago to authorise police to clear the encampment that ultimately led to the spread of the protests nationwide. "This is a movement that started with only 70 students," she said. "And because Columbia University decided to crack down on them and violate their first amendment, this has now spread nationally and internationally. " She spoke after apparently leading a prayer with protesters on Columbia's campus. Some of the demonsrators held up towels to obscure BBC reporters' view of what was happening. In 2019 the congresswoman apologised after tweeting that US support for Israel was "all about the Benjamins baby", a slang term for $100 bills, a post that drew accusations of antisemitism. Ilhan Omar is visiting the student protest encampment at Columbia University. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
