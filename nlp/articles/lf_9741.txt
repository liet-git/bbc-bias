The issue now is whether Israel will indeed open up the crossings and allow more aid to flow into Gaza, and whether that will satisfy US President Joe Biden enough to allow the war to continue to be prosecuted in the same way as it has been. There have been lots of leaks here in the Israeli press about supposedly very angry meetings between the US and Israel. These suggest the Israelis have been raising their voices about the proposed Rafah operation in the southern city of Gaza and the Americans have been saying that Israeli plans to try and safeguard civilians during that operation are totally inadequate. So I think it depends what happens on the ground now. Obviously President Biden has said something to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that has pushed him into announcing a change of policy. I wonder if that is the threat of putting condition on the use of American weapons, which up to now the Biden administration has been absolutely against doing. The pressure for doing that is now coming from very mainstream elements inside the US Democratic party, including allies of Biden, so perhaps he has waved that prospect in front of Israel, and perhaps that has worried them.
