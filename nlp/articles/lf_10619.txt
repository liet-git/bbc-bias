As pressure grows on Israel over the huge number of Palestinians being killed by its military in Gaza and a worsening humanitarian crisis in the territory, Foreign Minister Eli Cohen said the war against Hamas would continue, with or without international support. His comments came after a non-binding vote at the UN General Assembly that overwhelmingly approved a resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire, and the strongest comments yet by President Biden over the situation in Gaza. Israel, he said, was starting to lose support worldwide because of its “indiscriminate bombing”. Cohen also said that, at this stage, a ceasefire would be “a gift” to Hamas. So far, the US has supported Israel’s opposition to a pause in hostilities. But senior American officials are increasingly demonstrating discontent with the way Israel is conducting its offensive. A week ago, Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin warned that Israel risked turning a tactical victory into a strategic defeat by killing so many people. Disagreements are also emerging about what a post-war Gaza will look like. Tomorrow, Jake Sullivan, Biden’s national security adviser, arrives in Israel for talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Israeli media say their discussions will include a timetable for the end of the war – and some suggest that Netanyahu, by openly disagreeing with the Biden administration, is trying to appeal to his right-wing base. Speaking with a military commander serving in Gaza this afternoon, Netanyahu said the war would “continue until the end, until the victory, until the elimination of Hamas”. And, reflecting “international pressures”, he added that “nothing will stop us”. As previous Israeli wars show calls for a ceasefire will soon become too loud to be ignored. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
