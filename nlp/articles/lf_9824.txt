T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. US secretary of state Antony Blinken says he has heard a new and powerful message from Israel’s neighbours over the last three days. They are willing not only to live with Israel but to integrate the region in a way that makes everyone secure, including Israel. In other words, talk of diplomatic normalisation with Israel - which had appeared to be derailed by the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel - is on the table. That, he said, will require some hard decisions and hard choices – which include Israeli’s agreeing to a "clear pathway to the realisation of Palestinian political rights and a Palestinian state". Blinken’s meetings in Israel on Tuesday were not entirely without tangible results. The secretary announced that the US and Israel agreed on a plan for the UN to conduct an "assessment mission" that would be the first step toward allowing Palestinians to return to the areas of northern Gaza that have been devastated by the Israeli offensive. Even here, however, Blinken warned that their return would not happen "overnight". Too much has to be done to clear the area of unexploded ordinance and booby traps, as well as to ensure supporting infrastructure is in place. Few expected the US secretary of state to announce a major breakthrough after his latest day of talks with the Israelis. But while Blinken painted a picture of progress and the prospect, ultimately, of permanent peace, this latest trip has shown just how far there is left to go. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
