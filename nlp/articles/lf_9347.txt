T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. We're hearing from Dr Mohamed Al Sheikh, who has been working this morning at Al-Shifa, the main hospital in northern Gaza. While there, he's come across three-year-old Jude Mohammed al Arâ€™een and his mother, who had this to say about her son's condition: Jude was injured. We were seeking shelter, he was injured, and his brother was killed along with a cousin, as well as several other injuries to our family members. My son lost his leg. He suffers because he can no longer move like other children or play. He has so many questions as a three-year-old child. I ask for a ceasefire and a prosthetic for my child, as this is affecting him. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
