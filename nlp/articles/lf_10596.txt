T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi spoke to his Iranian counterpart last night, Beijing state media says, reporting that Iran said it was "willing to exercise restraint" after its attack on Israel. During the call, Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian told Wang Yi that Iran had no intention of further escalating tensions, adding that the situation was "very sensitive". "China appreciates Iran's stress on not targeting regional and neighbouring countries as well as its reiteration on continuously pursuing a good-neighbourly and friendly policy," state news agency Xinhua quoted Wang as saying. "It is believed that Iran can handle the situation well and spare the region further turmoil while safeguarding its own sovereignty and dignity. " Tehran's foreign ministry readout said Amir-Abdollahian briefed Wang on Iran's "legitimate action" and "warned the White House" that further attacks on Iran's interests or security would invite a "decisive, immediate and extensive" response.
