More now from Isaeli PM's adviser Mark Regev, who says the area where the three hostages were mistakenly killed by the IDF in Gaza is "a combat zone". He says there's been hostile fire towards IDF forces in the area before and "the whole area is a war zone". "That doesn't, of course, justify what's happened and that's why it's being investigated at the highest level - it's unacceptable what happened. " Asked about reports of negotiations resuming with Hamas, Regev says he can't go into any detail and will only update "if there's a serious opportunity to facilitate the freeing of hostages". He says the use of force on the Hamas military machine is the best way to expedite the release of hostages. He goes on to say that he showed US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, during his visit to Israel last week, how Israel identifies and engages targets in Gaza and makes efforts to limit or avoid civilian casualties. "The idea Israel is carpet-bombing is simply not true - we have a rigorous selection process for the use of forces on the base of intelligence. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
