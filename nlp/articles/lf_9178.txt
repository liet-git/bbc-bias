The flight tracking website Flightradar24 shows how several airports in Iran closed last night, and flights were cleared from part of its airspace, following reports an Israeli missile had struck the country. Some airlines including Turkish Airlines, flydubai and Emirates rerouted their aircraft. But with airports and airspace now re-opened, there are passenger planes in the sky above Iran again. Airlines will be keeping a very close eye on the security situation though, and things aren’t quite back to normal. Flydubai has cancelled its services to Iran today. The airline told the BBC it’s monitoring the situation closely and will make changes to flight paths ‘"in consultation with the relevant authorities". Lufthansa had already decided earlier this week not to use Iranian airspace until 30 April, and have announced today they would be suspending flights to Tel Aviv and Erbil and fly around Iraqi airspace until tomorrow.
