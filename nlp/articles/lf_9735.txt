T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. More comments now from the IDF's briefing about Monday's strike. The IDF sets out the events leading up to the incident, saying that the aid workers had been overseeing the distribution of food aid that had arrived on a ship from Cyprus, and unloaded at a recently constructed jetty in the northern Gaza strip before the strike. Under co-ordination with the IDF, the World Central Kitchen team were transferring these supplies to a warehouse a few kilometres further south, the military says. During this process, the IDF say their drone operators spotted a gunman riding on the roof of a large aid lorry, that was being escorted by the WCK team. This gunman was seen, in a video shown to journalists, to fire a shot. At this stage an attempt to contact WCK is made by the military, it says. The IDF says military called a WCK co-ordinator, who is unable to reach the team on the ground – where phone communication is patchy, and where aid agencies say they are prohibited by the IDF from using radios. The drone footage also appears to confirm that at night, the stickers on the roof of the World Central Kitchen vehicles, with the charity’s logo, are not visible to the drone operator, it adds.
