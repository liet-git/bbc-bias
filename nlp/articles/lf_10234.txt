President Biden’s recent comments about “indiscriminate bombing” in Gaza has heightened scrutiny on whether Israel is meeting conditions for the use of American weapons. The administration’s arms transfer policy requires the State Department to determine that the weapons it sells are unlikely to be used for genocide, crimes against humanity, breaches of the Geneva conventions or serious violations of international law. The spokesman Matthew Miller was pressed on this again today. He repeated that the department is monitoring and collecting information on the conflict, but has made no legal determination on whether Israel is complying with the laws of war. He also stressed that the administration makes clear to Israelis they should be doing more to minimise civilian harm in Gaza, and has seen “progress in a number of areas". But there’s growing disquiet among some in congress about Israel’s military conduct. Five Democratic senators wrote to the president last week asking for details about US oversight and accountability measures on arms sales to Israel. Biden told a closed-door fundraising event on Tuesday that Israel was starting to lose international support because of its destructive bombing campaign. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
