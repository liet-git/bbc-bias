Israel, with the help of the United States, was well prepared for Iran’s attack. It had been telegraphed in advance. But more importantly both Israel and the United States had sophisticated air defence systems already in place. Israel has had plenty of experience shooting down simultaneous rocket attacks by Hamas from Gaza over many years. Israel has sophisticated air defences, including its Iron Dome system, David’s Sling and Arrow aerial defence system - which have all been used to take out Hamas rockets. The US has also been dealing with similar threats in the Red Sea – shooting down drones, cruise missiles and ballistic missiles fired by the Iranian backed Houthis in Yemen. US jets on the USS Dwight D Eisenhower have also been involved in destroying Houthi drones from the air, while the carrier strike group’s Arleigh Burke class of guided-missile destroyers have been successfully intercepting drones and missiles on a regular bases over the past four months. In other words, both Israel and the US already knew they had the military capabilities to successfully intercept Iranian weapons. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
