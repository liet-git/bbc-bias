Police are gradually breaking down the UCLA encampment. They have pushed forward into the camp around 20 metres on one side, using flash bangs to disrupt as they go. Now a line of police is facing off against protesters from the encampment, who are all linking arms and attempting to prevent officers from moving forward. As of 04:30 local time (12:30 BST), the camp is surrounded on all sides by police. Protesters are clearly getting more agitated as they realise police have managed to break down their barricades, but seem to intend to hold out as long as they can. The demonstrators were clearly getting ready for this moment during the day. Protesters with megaphones inside the encampment are shouting instructions to each other, warning people to use goggles and headgear. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
