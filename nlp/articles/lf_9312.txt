As Israeli tanks try to push deeper into the city of Khan Younis in southern Gaza, BBC's Newshour has spoken to Ghada, a Palestinian journalist in the western part of Khan Younis. "The situation is so horrible. . . air-strikes every minute and tank-shells. . . everything is shaking. "Israel has said this is a safe place for now, but it is not safe. . we cannot move too much. . People are trying to flee to Rafah," Ghada said, referring to the Gaza's southernmost city on the border with Egypt. "We have had no electricity for a few days - today I came to the hospital where I could charge my phone. " She added that the water in the city is polluted, and that it's exposing people to diseases. Hundreds of thousands of people have fled the fighting in the north of Gaza to take shelter in Khan Younis, after Israel told them to leave the north of the strip. Earlier this week, the UN said around 1.8 million people are internally displaced in Gaza.
