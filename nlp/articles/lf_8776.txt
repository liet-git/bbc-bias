A lot has been happening over the past few days. Here's a round-up of where we're at ahead of an emergency UN Security Council meeting later this evening. At least 45 Palestinians were killed in an Israeli air strike on the city of Rafah on Sunday , the Hamas-run health ministry said, while hundreds more were treated for severe burns, fractures and shrapnel wounds. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu said the strike was a “tragic mishap” but vowed to continue the war against Hamas. Strikes on Rafah, where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had been sheltering, have continued overnight, with 16 people reportedly killed. There has been international condemnation of Sunday's strike , with UN secretary general António Guterres saying: "There is no safe place in Gaza. This horror must stop" At Algeria's request, a UN Security Council will hold an emergency meeting later toda y to discuss Sunday's strike on Rafah. Last week, the EU asked Israel to "fully respect" a ruling by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) that Israel stop military actions on Rafah "which may inflict on the Palestinian group in Gaza conditions of life that could bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part”. Since the ICJ ruling, Israel has pledged to continue the offensive on Rafah , with officials insisting the ruling left room for its operation to continue. Ireland, Norway and Spain are expected to formally recognise the state of Palestine today. A Palestinian boy stands at the site of Sunday's strike on Rafah. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
