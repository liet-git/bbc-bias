Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry has just issued its regular casualty update, which says 28,340 Palestinians have been killed and nearly 68,000 wounded in the Strip since 7 October. The ministry says 164 have been killed and 200 injured in Gaza over the last day, although it is not clear exactly how many died in Israeli attacks on Rafah overnight. We've had conflicting reports on this, with heath ministry spokesman Ashraf al-Qudra saying 67 people were killed in Rafah. But the AFP news agency, also citing the ministry, is reporting more than 100 killed in the city on the border with Egypt. Israel's military launched its operations in the Gaza Strip after more than 1,200 people were killed in southern Israel on 7 October by Hamas gunmen, who also took 253 people hostage. A number of those hostages were later released. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
