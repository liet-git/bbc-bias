Everywhere is overcrowded here in Rafah city in the south of Gaza. There are no proper shelters available for families who have newly arrived. People have been setting up makeshift tents on any piece of scrubland around the city. The tents here are even flimsier and more tattered than they were in Khan Younis. It’s unclear whether they’d survive the rain or cold. Huge numbers of people are also crowding around centres set up by the UN Relief and Works Agency (Unrwa), where bags of flour are distributed to residents and displaced families. The centre is open every day from 07:00 to 14:00 local time. As I waited to get flour for my family, people were growing angry, desperate to get flour as they cannot afford to buy any bread. The Palestinian Red Crescent is also setting up a huge field hospital in Rafah in case the number of people wounded in air strikes starts to overwhelm the main hospital. A woman carries bread next to destroyed houses in Rafah on the southern Gaza Strip. Israel has urged Gazans to flee towards Rafah from some parts of the southern city of Khan Younis. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
