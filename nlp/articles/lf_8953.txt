An "alliance of authoritarian powers" is working more closely together against Western democracies, the head of Nato has warned. Jens Stoltenberg has told the BBC that Russia, Iran, China and North Korea are increasingly aligned. The Nato chief explains that: "China is propping up the Russian war economy, delivering key parts to the defence industry, and in return, Moscow is mortgaging its future to Beijing. " He also has said he's confident that allies of the Nato military alliance would agree a long-term funding deal for Ukraine by July. But he also suggests Ukraine might have to decide on some "kind of compromises". On the Middle East conflict, he has said it is "very important" that the US and other Nato countries convey "a very clear message to Israel" that they have to do "significantly more" to protect civilians and aid workers after the World Central Kitchen convoy attack . Stoltenberg took over as the leader of Nato, the Western defence alliance, 10 years ago. Speaking to mark the 75th anniversary of the organisation, he has told me the world is now "much more dangerous, much more unpredictable" and "much more violent". He has said there is an "authoritarian" alliance giving each other practical support that is "more and more aligned". Read more here about Laura Kuenssberg's interview with Jens Stoltenberg.
