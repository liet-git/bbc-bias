We're now hearing from International Criminal Court (ICC) chief prosecutor Karim Khan and his reaction to the military strikes in Rafah. In a statement on X, Khan says he is "deeply concerned by the reported bombardment and potential ground incursion by Israeli forces". He says his office is "actively investigating any crimes allegedly committed", adding that "those who are in breach of the law will be held accountable". The ICC was designed to prosecute those responsible for genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. Based in The Hague, it has global jurisdiction. It is a court of last resort, intervening only when national authorities cannot or will not prosecute. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
