Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani says his country is open to new sanctions for individuals engaged in actions against Israel. "If we need to have more sanctions for people clearly engaged against Israel, supporting for example terrorism, supporting Hamas, it is possible to do it," Tajani tells Reuters news agency. But he adds that G7 countries - Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the US and UK - would need to be "very serious and to work all together". His remarks follow an online call with G7 leaders on Sunday, who met to restate their support towards Israel after Iran launched more than 300 projectiles at Israel the previous day. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
