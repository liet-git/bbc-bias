SNP MP Brendan O'Hara brings his remarks to a close and, as he does, he says he wants to share with the House the words of people forced to "live through this hell". He recounts the words of a Palestinian man who lost his wife and three children - aged four, five and just three months old. O'Hara recounts his testimony: "My body survived but my spirit died with my children it was crushed under the rubble with them. " "That's why tonight really matters," O'Hara says.
