Hanoch Milwidsky, who is vice-president of the Israeli parliament and a Knesset member from PM Netanyahu's Likud Party, has told the BBC there is unanimity in the Israeli government that there should be a response to the Iranian attack. “We knew it was coming, there was a lot of expectation and we were very happy that it ended the way it ended, at least this round,” he told the BBC's Newshour programme, referring to the large number of drones and missiles that were intercepted. “I don’t think anybody in the government is really suggesting not to retaliate to this act”. Asked if he believed there was similar unanimity within Israel's war cabinet, which was formed after the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza erupted, he said: "Absolutely. " “I don’t think anybody in his right mind can expect not to retaliate after hundreds of missiles were fired at our direction”. Acknowledging the US desire to avoid military escalation in focus on diplomacy, he said this was a "very crucial time in the history of Israel". "Of course we listen, we consult with all our friends in the world but eventually the last word should be ours. ”. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
