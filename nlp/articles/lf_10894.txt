Today marks exactly six months since the deadly 7 October Hamas attacks against Israel, in which about 1,200 Israelis were killed and more than 250 others were taken hostage. The attacks led to an Israeli military campaign in Gaza, which has killed more than 33,000 Palestinians, mainly women and children, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. If you are just joining us, here are the latest updates on the conflict as the grim half-year milestone is reached. The Israel Defense Forces says the number of its forces in southern Gaza has "declined" as it regroups for the war's next stage. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel is "one step away from victory" but insists there will be no ceasefire without the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas. The World Food Programme has repeated its warning that famine is imminent in northern Gaza, and says children are dying of hunger. Israel has launched air strikes on the eastern Lebanese city of Baalbek, targeting what it says are Hezbollah infrastructure sites. Tens of thousands of Israelis have been protesting against Netanyahu , calling for a Gaza hostage deal and for elections now. Families have gathered at the memorial site for victims killed during the Nova music festival in the 7 October Hamas attacks, near the border with Gaza, in southern Israel. In a statement marking the anniversary, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak says he supports Israel’s right to defend itself but adds the UK has been “shocked” by the bloodshed of the war and the deaths of British aid workers.
