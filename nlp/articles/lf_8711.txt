We're reporting today that with the threat of famine looming in Gaza, few Muslims are able to hold a traditionally opulent Eid. Andrea De Domenico, head of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) tells the BBC that the lack of "abundance of food and festive ornaments" means today is "not an Eid like others". He says UN organisations are negotiating with Israel to get more aid into Gaza, and that many challenges remain, even for the trucks that do get into the enclave. "We have done a calculation, from 1 April to 9 April, collectively 14 convoys that have been going to the north have been waiting 29 hours to get the green light to get through the checkpoint. "There are so many challenges that are still there, are still unresolved and those depend, and are under the control of the Israel military, and so we are really engaging with them daily to try to figure out solutions and improve the situation," De Domenico says.
