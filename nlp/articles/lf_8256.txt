Starmer says information about a 2016 investigation - trawled 17 years of records to find out how often, and why, cash accounts on the Horizon IT system had been tampered with remotely - has just come to light this week. It comes after the BBC revealed that David Cameron's government knew the Post Office had ditched a secret investigation that might have helped wrongly accused postmasters prove their innocence. He points out the current foreign secretary, David Cameron, was running the government at the time of the scandal. He says: "Has (the PM) thought to ask either of them what they knew in 2016?".
