We checked in with journalist Aseel Mousa , who tells us that many people in Gaza don’t have internet access. She says her friends in the north have asked her for help getting eSims - a virtual Sim card which you can load on to your phone. While the internet is working as she messages with us, she says it “keeps breaking up” when she is trying to work, and makes staying in touch with her brother who lives abroad difficult.
