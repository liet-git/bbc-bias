T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer trained his questions on the Post Office scandal, and criticised the government over delays to compensation for sub-postmasters. Sunak replied by saying the government had taken "unprecedented steps" to ensure that victims get compensation. The PM also said he stands by Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch following her row with the Post Office's former chairman. From here, PMQs was dominated by calls for a ceasefire in Gaza, with the SNP's Westminster leader Stephen Flynn urging the PM to "send a clear and united message that we back an immediate ceasefire" But Sunak claimed this was "not in anyone's interest" without a plan for a permanent solution. He said the government was instead calling for an "immediate humanitarian pause" to allow hostages out and aid into Gaza. It comes ahead of a Commons debate and a vote later on the subject, called by the SNP. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
