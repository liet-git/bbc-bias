We're now hearing from panellist and former Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi who this week announced he would be standing down as an MP at the next election. In a resignation letter shared on X, he said “the time is right for a new, energetic Conservative to fight for the honour of representing Stratford-on-Avon”. It makes him the 64th Conservative MP to announce he'll stand down at the next election, and the 104th MP. Zahawi was sacked last year as Tory Party chairman by Rishi Sunak after an ethics inquiry found he had failed to disclose that HMRC was investigating his tax affairs. The HMRC investigation had resulted in him paying a settlement including a penalty. In a statement at the time, Zahawi said HMRC concluded the mistake was “careless and not deliberate”. We'll bring you what Zahawi has to say on this shortly. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
