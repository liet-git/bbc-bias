A phone call between US President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is reported by Reuters and ABC to have taken place. We don't yet know exactly what they are discussing, but it was expected that Biden would bring up the need to better protect humanitarian workers. It's the first time the two leaders have spoken since an Israeli strike killed seven aid workers in Gaza on Monday. The White House's daily briefing is scheduled for 13:30 local time (18:30 BST). We'll find out more about the phone call then. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
