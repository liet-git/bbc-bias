Dr Mohamed Al Sheikh sent us this message just over an hour ago from Al-Shifa, the main hospital in northern Gaza, which has been the focus of Israel's ground offensive: I sleep here at the hospital. We work on a 24/7 basis. We can only take three to four hours rest. For the rest of the time we work. We don't go to our homes. Our families are here in northern Gaza, staying in shelters in schools. We have no communications with them. Regarding food, only a few items are available, especially with a lack of flour and rice, and there is a shortage of basic food necessities. We provide whatever we can. We have been receiving casualties who are mainly women, children and the elderly. The casualties were sleeping when [the attacks happened] and came here after they were injured. Since the beginning of the war in October I have only left the hospital twice. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
