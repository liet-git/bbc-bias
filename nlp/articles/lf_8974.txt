Laura starts off by asking Former Cabinet Secretary Lord Mark Sedwill about the security situation we are facing across the world. He says he thinks we are in the most dangerous period since the end of the Cold War. She asks Baroness Valerie Amos about the situation in Gaza and whether our leaders are near to grappling it. It is one the “major challenges” we are facing, Amos says. She says she thinks the global leadership we are seeing right now “doesn’t really feel as if it is up to tackling” the crises the world is facing. Laura asks comedian Ruby Wax, as a citizen watching the news day after day, if she finds it overwhelming. She says she thinks a lot of people find it overwhelming, and refers to the “flashing horror constantly” on our televisions. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
