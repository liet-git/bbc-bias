T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Earlier we heard from Akram Aggour , who evacuated from north Gaza and is now sheltering in Rafah. He's been in touch again to tell us more about what it's like sharing a tent with seven other people: I'm not living with my family right now. My family are in a house, but I'm in a tent with my friends so I can go out and about easily for my work. Every day the eight of us wake up and we prepare breakfast. It's all canned food because there's nothing to buy in the market except canned food. We're old friends, and we're used to banding together whenever a conflict breaks out. We've been staying together in the same place since 10 October. Usually, the first thing that happens is the electricity and the comms go out. We try to pool our resources to survive, and put our money together to buy food and other supplies every week, for ourselves and for other people who are struggling. Akram Aggour, right, has been sharing a tent with his friends in Rafah. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
