As we've just reported, the UK government has suggested it is preparing to impose sanctions on Israeli settlers responsible for violence against Palestinians in the West Bank settlers. Now, the European Union says it will propose to member states that they should impose sanctions on extremist settlers who commit acts of violence against Palestinians in the West Bank, the EU's foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell told reporters following a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels. Attacks have surged in the West Bank since the start of the war in the Gaza Strip, triggered by Hamas's assault on southern Israel on 7 October. Violent attacks, including fatal shootings of Palestinians by armed Jewish settlers in the West Bank have risen sharply . So many attacks are happening that Israel's closest allies, including the United States and the United Kingdom, have condemned violence by extremist settlers and demanded that those guilty of crimes should be prosecuted.
