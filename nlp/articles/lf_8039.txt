We're looking at the key issues affecting people in Gaza - one being the desperate living conditions and food shortages as the conflict between Israel and Hamas continues. On 7 October Hamas attacked Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking 253 others hostage. Israel responded with an intense bombing campaign, followed by a ground invasion, with the aim of eliminating Hamas, which is a proscribed as a terrorist organisation in the UK, the US and other countries. Armoured bulldozers created routes for tanks and troops, as Israeli forces tried to clear the area of Hamas fighters based in northern Gaza. Having cut Gaza in two, the Israelis pushed further into Gaza City, where they faced resistance from Hamas. While Israeli forces have since conducted ground operations across much of northern Gaza, there are still clashes in some areas, according to analysts from the Institute for the Study of War. Whole districts in Gaza City have been razed to the ground and swathes of agricultural land and greenhouse areas have been returned to sand under the tracks of heavy vehicles and tanks as part of clearing operations by Israeli troops.
