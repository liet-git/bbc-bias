Oil prices did not move much over the weekend after Iran’s reprisal attack as oil markets were already anticipating a reaction from Tehran. Last week, prices had already risen with Brent crude - the global benchmark for oil prices - touching its highest levels since October on Friday. But on Monday, it dipped below $90 a barrel, indicating that the markets were not expecting further escalation for now. However, energy analysts say the attack has raised concerns about possible disruption to global oil supply. The direction of the markets would depend on Israel’s next move. Oil prices could surge if Tel Aviv decides to initiate a strong action. Iran is the third-largest producer in oil cartel, Opec, with a capacity to pump three million barrels of oil per day. Any disruption in its production or an attack on Iran could send oil prices higher. High fuel and energy prices were one of the biggest reasons for the rising cost of living in the past couple of years. In 2022, when Russia invaded Ukraine, oil prices soared to $120 a barrel over supply fears as western nations slapped sanctions on Russia, one of the world's major oil exporters. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
