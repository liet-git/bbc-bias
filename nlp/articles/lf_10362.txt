A bit more reaction now, this time from Turkey. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has welcomed the acceptance of a ceasefire proposal by Hamas and says he hopes Israel will do the same, according to a report by Reuters. The agency says Erdogan is also calling on Western countries to increase their pressure on Israel. Last week, Turkey suspended all trade with Israel over its offensive in Gaza, citing the "worsening humanitarian tragedy" in the strip. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met in September 2023, just weeks before Hamas attacked Israel. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
