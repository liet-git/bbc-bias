T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Joe Biden picked an interesting time to announce his administration’s latest push for an end to the Gaza war. His White House appearance, which was added to the president’s schedule on short notice to reporters, comes the day after Donald Trump’s historic felony conviction and just a few hours after Trump spoke to reporters for 40 minutes in New York City. Biden’s remarks could be seen as a way for the president to elbow his way back into the news – and to do so in a way that contrasts with Trump, by presenting himself as a statesman trying to bring peace (on an issue that has cost him support among his political base, as well). Biden led off with his first public comments about Trump’s conviction, however, including broad condemnations of the “reckless” and “irresponsible” way the president – and, by extension other Republicans – have condemned the felony verdict as rigged. By talking about the verdict at the top, Biden may have sought to further boost interest in his Gaza War remarks. But it also risked burying them. While war and peace in the Middle East may be a more important story, Trump’s conviction dominates the headlines in America right now. And unless Biden’s peace plan actually takes hold, only his comments on his presidential rival will leave a mark. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
