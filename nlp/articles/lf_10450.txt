T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. The White House has just distributed a handout of a phone call that took place today between US President Joe Biden and the Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. It says the leaders discussed what happened in northern Gaza, that they grieved the loss of civilian lives and agreed that this incident "underscored the urgency of bringing negotiations to a close as soon as possible and expanding the flow of humanitarian assistance into Gaza". They're also said to have discussed efforts to secure the immediate release of hostages being held by Hamas. Israel says 253 Israelis and foreigners were kidnapped by Hamas on 7 October. Of those taken, 130 remain unaccounted for, though earlier this month Israel said at least 29 of them were dead. The release of hostages would result in an "immediate and sustained ceasefire in Gaza over a period of at least six weeks", Biden and the Qatari leader said, agreeing to stay in regular contact over the next few days.
