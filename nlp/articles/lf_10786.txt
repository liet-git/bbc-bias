The legal arena is becoming increasingly influential in determining how this conflict is perceived by the rest of the world. International law has become a vital, neutral framework to aid our understanding of global norms and standards and help us to understand whether they are being met. The ICJ has no enforcement mechanism, no police or peacekeepers, it relies on cooperation from states. But the world is watching. A ruling in South Africa's favour will place additional political pressure on Israel to work towards a ceasefire. It will intensify focus on Israel's international allies to do what they can behind the scenes to find a resolution and guarantee humanitarian assistance gets to where it's needed. This politically contentious case has resonance around the world and a potentially tangible direct and immediate impact for people on the ground in Israel and Gaza. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
