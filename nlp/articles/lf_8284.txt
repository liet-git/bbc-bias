Good morning and welcome to our coverage of a busy day in the world of politics. We'll be covering Rishi Sunak taking questions at PMQs at midday, as well as a vote on the SNP's call for an "immediate ceasefire" in Gaza as part of an opposition day debate. That won't take place until later this afternoon, but it has been the subject of days of debate – particularly when it comes to Labour. The party has tabled its own amendment to the bill, which aims to appease some tension within its ranks. But now that might not even see the light of day, after the government put forward its own amendment – threatening to expose Labour division over the issue.
