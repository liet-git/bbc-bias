The question now is whether this statement from the IDF will go any way towards alleviating the suffering in Gaza. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said the results are what’s going to matter. So how do you measure those results? They can be measured in whether large numbers of Palestinians keep getting killed and whether the rapid, imminent, full-on slide into famine is arrested - and whether or not, even though even more entrances into Gaza have been opened, Israel allows adequate supplies through them. Up until now, Israel has insisted that all the aid that was needed was getting into Gaza, and that any shortfall was the fault of the UN and Hamas - they’ve now been forced to move away from that position after what must have been a very testy phone call between President Biden and Netanyahu last night. The sequence of events that took place suggests that the Israeli army were out to get the people in that aid convoy. There was a suggestion that the army couldn’t see the logos, but don’t forget World Central Kitchen was co-ordinating extensively with the Israelis. That aid team were bringing in food and other aid supplies by sea, onto a pier they had built - impossible without an enormous deal of coordination in advance. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
