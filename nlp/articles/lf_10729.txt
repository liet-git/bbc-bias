BBC Arabic has been asking Gazans how they feel about the UN's top court ordering Israel to take all measures to prevent genocidal acts in Gaza, but stopping short of telling it to halt the war. Reacting to the ruling, one young woman said: "We felt betrayed because there is no ceasefire or even a truce, which could make the situation more bearable for us. " "When we heard the news, we were greatly disappointed in this matter. We had hoped for a decision to cease fire from the International Court of Justice," said another young man in Gaza. The BBC spoke to this woman who said: "The ICJ that encompasses all countries and all those who defend human rights, aren’t we human beings? Don’t we have rights? Where are our children?" And the ruling was met with disappointment from this man: "We had high hopes of the ICJ. The decision as expected was to continue this war on us. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
