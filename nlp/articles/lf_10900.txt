A spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) tells the BBC that the military is regrouping and conducting preparations for its next stage in the war. Lt Col Peter Lerner says: "This is another stage in the war effort. " It comes after reports this morning that the IDF has withdrawn all of its ground troops on active manoeuvres from southern Gaza. Lerner says the IDF's military campaign is "continuously evolving". "The war is not over. War can only be over when they [hostages] come home and when Hamas is gone. " He says the military completed its mission in the Khan Younis area and its troops will rotate out. "It is a decline in the forces but there are more operations that need to be conducted. Rafah is clearly a stronghold. We need to dismantle Hamas' capabilities wherever they are. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
