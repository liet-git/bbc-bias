T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Conservative MP Sir Edward Leigh is now addressing the house, and begins by saying nothing can justify the "genocide" on 7 October. "There is no point in having a unilateral ceasefire if you're faced with a death cult who will go on bombing and killing innocent Israelis," he says, referring to Hamas. It will achieve nothing, he continues, stressing the need for a balanced, sustainable ceasefire. "There's no future for Palestinian people in Gaza with Hamas in control," Leigh adds. He describes the government's amendment as "moderate" and "sensible", and urges MPs to support it. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
