As we've been telling you, a US State Department official says Washington is pushing Israel to protect civilian life as heavy fighting continues. Nathaniel Tek said the US believes it is "critical that Israel places a premium on the protection of human life, and for the ability of aid organisations to access civilians". "There certainly is more that can be done, and more precise and clear directions can be given to civilians to ensure they can reach safety. "We believe that while Israel's intent is there to ensure the protection of civilians, the results also matter and we are working and pressing the government of Israel to make sure they are putting a premium on civilian life. " He said there were "two sides to this conflict" - adding that Hamas too had a responsibility to protect civilians but that the group had "not shown any interest or inclination to do so". Tek said Israel could only achieve a strategic victory if it protected civilians and worked towards an enduring peace. "So there are two aspects to this, the moral and the strategic, that we have been trying to push. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
