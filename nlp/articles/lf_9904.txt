Some news to bring you from the UK as the Foreign Office has announced a fresh clampdown on four "extremist Israeli settlers" who it claims have "committed human rights abuses against Palestinian communities in the West Bank". According to the Foreign Office these include: Moshe Sharvit â€“ an "extremist settler" who the UK government says has "threatened, harassed and assaulted Palestinian shepherds" and their families in the Jordan Valley. Yinon Levy , who the Foreign Office describes as the leader of the "Meitarim Farm" outpost whose settlers it says have used physical violence and the destruction of property to displace Palestinian communities including Zanuta in October 2023. Zvi Bar Yosef - who officials say is a settler leader who has used intimidation and violence against local Palestinians, including twice threatening at gunpoint young families having a picnic. Finally, Ely Federman is accused of being involved in multiple incidents against Palestinian shepherds in the South Hebron Hills, according to the Foreign Office. Extremist Israeli settlers are threatening Palestinians, often at gunpoint, and forcing them off land that is rightfully theirs. This behaviour is illegal and unacceptable. Israel must also take stronger action and put a stop to settler violence. " Lord Cameron. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
