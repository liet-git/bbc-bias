The female soldier was “severely injured” and a civilian lightly hurt when a gunman left a car and fired on vehicles before fleeing, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) says. Ground troops and an aircraft are in the area to pursue the gunman, the IDF adds. There has been a rise in violence in the occupied West Bank since the start of the Israel-Hamas war six months ago. At least 459 Palestinians and 17 Israeli soldiers and civilians have been killed there since 7 October, according to AFP news agency, citing the Palestinian health ministry in Ramallah.
