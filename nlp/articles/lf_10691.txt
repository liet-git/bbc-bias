The road outside the hospital at the entrance to Jenin Camp, in the occupied West Bank, is littered with stones. All day Israeli armoured vehicles have been moving around these shuttered streets, followed at a distance by a group of young men and boys. The bodies of three of the four men killed in a drone strike in Jenin's Old City this morning were brought here. Their families are still waiting for the military operation to finish before they can bury them. Inside the hospital, its director Dr Wissam Bakr tells me that Israeli raids and incursions had increased since the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October. "Every day there is a raid in the city, or the camp, or a village or town near Jenin," he says. "The persistence of the invasions and the killing of young people will make people in Jenin more and more angry, because every day we lose one of our friends. " "This will not bring peace to Israel," he says. "This will bring more and more resistance. " Loud explosions still can still be heard from time to time, and thick smoke can be seen spiralling up from the camp and the hillside overlooking it. The sound of drones over the city is constant, joined at regular intervals by the Muslim call to prayer, sweeping up and over the loud monotone buzz. This operation began some 12 hours ago and shows no sign of slowing. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
