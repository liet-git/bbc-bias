Israeli settlers who attack Palestinians in the West Bank will face targeted action against them according to the top US diplomat, Secretary of State Antony Blinken. The US has announced a visa ban on Israeli extremists responsible for violence in the territory but added that the ban would also apply to Palestinians accused of violence. The ban will affect "dozens" of extremist Israelis and some of their family members said state department spokesman Matthew Miller, who added that US law forbade the naming of any individuals. Attacks have surged in the West Bank since the start of the war in the Gaza Strip, triggered by Hamas's assault on southern Israel on 7 October. In recent weeks Palestinians speaking to the BBC accused settlers of using the war in Gaza as an opportunity to seize land. More than 700,000 Jewish people live in more than 250 settlements built since Israel's occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war. The vast majority of the international community considers the settlements illegal under international law, though Israel and the US dispute this interpretation. Full story. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
