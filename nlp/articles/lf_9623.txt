The bombardment of southern Gaza has intensified since the start of December, with the city of Khan Younis bearing the brunt of Israel's military action. At least 55% of the cityâ€™s buildings have been damaged or destroyed since the start of the war, according to satellite data analysis. Residential areas have been left ruined, and once bustling streets reduced to rubble across much of the city. As of 2 April, at least 45,000 buildings are now destroyed or damaged, which represents an area of almost 21 sq km (8.1 sq miles), according to the latest data. The analysis, carried out by Corey Scher of City University of New York and Jamon Van Den Hoek of Oregon State University, compares images to reveal sudden changes in the height or structure of buildings which indicate damage.
