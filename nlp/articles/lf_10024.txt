Jordan's foreign minister Ayman Safadi has told local media that his country had summoned the Iranian ambassador to protest against Iranian comments that were an interference in the kingdom's internal affairs. Safadi was referring to comments in Iran's official media in recent days that warned Jordan would be the next target in the event it cooperated with Israel in a showdown with Iran. During the Iranian attack on Israel, Jordan also intercepted flying objects that entered its airspace. This was to secure the safety of its citizens, a Jordanian cabinet statement said. Earlier Safadi said that regional escalation had to be prevented as it "could push whole region into abyss of war". But he said the first step towards de-escalation was ending the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza and "starting to implement the two-state solution [for Israelis and Palestinians] as it is the only path to security & peace for all". Jordan, which has a peace treaty with Israel, has been highly critical of the way Israel has carried out its campaign against Hamas in Gaza, which has killed 33,000 mainly civilians, according to the Hamas-run Gaza ministry of health.
