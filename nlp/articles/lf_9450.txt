T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. More comments now from World Central Kitchen (WCK) founder José Andrés, who earlier accused Israel of deliberately targeting the seven aid workers in Gaza, in an interview with Reuters. He's now spoken to Israeli broadcaster Channel 12 news, saying: “The airstrikes on our convoy, I don’t think were an unfortunate mistake. It was really a direct attack on clearly marked vehicles whose movements were known by everybody at the IDF. " He stresses that the WCK convoy was in a deconflicted zone controlled by the Israeli forces when it was attacked. Andrés says no one is questioning Israel's right to defend itself, but "defending your people is not killing everybody else around". Israel said the strike was "unintended" and that WCK workers were not deliberately targeted. World Central Kitchen founder José Andrés. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
