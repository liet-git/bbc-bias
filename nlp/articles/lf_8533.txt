The White House statement on the Biden-Netanyahu call is the most strident it has issued so far on Israel. It reflects the “outrage” President Biden’s officials have described about his reaction after the World Central Kitchen strike. It basically demands that Israel protect civilians and let food aid into Gaza. Here’s the key line: [Biden] made clear that US policy with respect to Gaza will be determined by our assessment of Israel’s immediate action on these steps. ”. That’s a significant shift - it will be interpreted as a threat - that there is a limit to US support given the catastrophically high numbers of civilians killed, the attacks on food delivery convoys, and that Gaza is on the brink of famine. The statement doesn’t set out which “US policy” areas it is talking about - but the bedrock to the US-Israel relationship is the supply of weapons, a policy which Biden has been under increasing pressure to start conditioning in order to make the Israelis protect civilians and let aid in. For the White House, arms transfers have so far remained off-limits to be used as leverage. Now many will read this statement as the administration signalling it is prepared for that to change.
