South Africa’s ruling African National Congress (ANC) has been in government for 30 years, but it spent even longer as an anti-apartheid liberation movement. For many years it had a paramilitary wing and was close to various foreign revolutionary groups, including Palestinian ones. That history remains core to the ANC’s identity and outlook. Palestinian people are seen as fundamental allies by the party. It sees parallels with its struggle against apartheid - a policy of racial segregation and discrimination enforced by the white-minority government in South Africa against the country's black majority, until the first democratic elections, in 1994. The country condemned the 7 October attacks and called for the release of the hostages. Nelson Mandela, after becoming South Africa's president, stated “our freedom is incomplete without the freedom of the Palestinians”. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
