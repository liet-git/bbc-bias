There are a lot of different threads around the war in Gaza today, so here's an at-a-glance look at what's going on: Lebanon. Forensic searches are ongoing in Beirut, following the killing of a senior Hamas official in the Lebanese capital last night. Israel has not officially claimed responsibility. Some are anticipating a response by the powerful militia Hezbollah, whose leader has previously said killings in Lebanon would be a red line. The UN has said it is deeply concerned about rising tensions and has called on all sides to de-escalate. The Israeli military has also increased its air defence capacity on the border with Lebanon, where exchanges of fire between the IDF and Hezbollah have been taking place for months. Gaza. As fighting continues to rage in Gaza, the Hamas-run health ministry says the number killed has risen to 22,313. The Palestinian Red Crescent aid organisation says many people sheltering in their building have left over fears for their safety, after reporting five people killed and three injured in an Israeli air strike on its headquarters yesterday. Israel says its troops have killed "dozens of terrorists" in Jabalia, in northern Gaza, and targeted others in Gaza City. Leaflets have been distributed telling residents to leave combat zones in Khan Younis. Red Sea. Attacks on shipping on the vital trade route linking Asia and Europe continue, with the US saying Houthi rebels in Yemen have fired two missiles at commercial vessels. A UN security council meeting, which is set to discuss the attacks in the Red Sea, is due to be held later. The head of the International Chamber of Shipping has told the BBC people are likely to see a rise in the price of goods within weeks because of the cost of re-routing vessels around the Horn of Africa.
