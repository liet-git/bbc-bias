Iranians woke up to reports of a "micro drones" attack on a military site in Isfahan, central Iran. Some western officials with knowledge of Israel’s possible retaliation against Iran’s unprecedented drone and missile attack on Israel believe that this is only “the first stage”. “The strategy is: Minor attack to make Iran react for a major response on the nuclear sites”, according to a western diplomat in Lebanon. Meanwhile, a western military official says that based on reports from Syria and Iran - indicating that some essential radars were the target of drone strikes in both countries, “Israelis are kind of mirroring Iran and its allies like Hezbollah by first trying to destroy radars, creating false or delusive targets as well as trying to damage the radars to disable interception systems," they said. There is still a lot of contradictory information coming out from Iran regarding the incident, with IRGC-linked media Tasnim denying “any attack on Iran” quoting “informed sources". While some Iranian officials told media that “there won’t be any reaction from Iran to the incident”. But the question is, was this really Israel’s expected retaliation? Western officials I talked to believe it was not. They tell me it is only a “trap” to “test the waters. ”. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
