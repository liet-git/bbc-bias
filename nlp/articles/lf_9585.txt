It is not a surprise that Spain has made this announcement today. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez - a socialist - has been campaigning for months to try to gain support from European partners for a formal recognition of a Palestinian state. He hasn't managed to persuade the bigger economies to get on board but has been working particularly closely with Ireland. Sanchez says the move to recognise a Palestinian state - which will formally be done by Spain's cabinet next week - reflects public opinion in the country, and is also the right thing to do.
