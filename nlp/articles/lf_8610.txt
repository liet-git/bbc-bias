T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) will hold public hearings later this month in proceedings launched by South Africa against Israel over the Gaza war. South Africa's application , submitted to The Hague on Friday, stated that the "acts and omissions by Israel" are "genocidal in character because they are intended to bring about the destruction of a substantial part of the Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group". Yesterday, a spokesperson for Israel's government said it would appear before the court to contest the "absurd blood libel". On Wednesday, US National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby called the case "meritless, counterproductive and completely without any basis in fact whatsoever". The hearings will take place on 11 and 12 January. The court usually takes up to a fortnight to issue a decision on emergency measures after the hearings. Its rulings are final but it has no authority to enforce them. The ICJ settles disputes between states and gives advisory opinions on international legal issues. It is distinct from the International Criminal Court (ICC), which â€‹investigates and tries individuals charged with genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. Israel does not recognise the ICC. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
