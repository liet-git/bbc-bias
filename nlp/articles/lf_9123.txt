Palestinian news agency Wafa is reporting that Israeli strikes continued in Gaza overnight. It said at least 14 people were killed in an Israeli bombing of a house west of Khan Younis in southern Gaza. The 14 people included nine children, the Hamas-run health ministry told Reuters. According to Wafa, Israeli aircraft and artillery also bombed homes in Al-Maghazi refugee camp and Al-Masdar village in the central Gaza Strip, killing dozens and wounding others. Israel has been telling people in parts of Gaza to evacuate, as intense battles with Hamas continue across the territory. On Wednesday planes dropped leaflets on Al-Nuseirat camp in the centre and also in Khan Younis, saying: "The area you are in is considered a dangerous combat zone". Smoke is seen billowing over Gaza, in a photo taken from southern Israel. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
