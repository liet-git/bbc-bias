Conservative MP Mark Francois is next to stand and starts by saying: "Collectively, last night was not our finest hour. " He notes that Sir Lindsay Hoyle has apologised over it, and that he should be afforded the courtesy of having his apology accepted in the same way that MPs who misbehave in the House hope their apologies are accepted by their colleagues. The Tory MP then pays tribute to Hoyle's role following the 2021 murder of MP Sir David Amess by an Islamic extremist. "Mr Speaker went the extra mile for all of us to help us all deal with that tragedy," Francois says. He says the House should return to the debate with Hoyle in the chair. Mordaunt rises to say that she has nothing to add to Francois's comments and notes that he "said it very well". T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
