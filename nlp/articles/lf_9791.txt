Staff at the Al-Shifa hospital were already in a “terrible condition” before the beginning of last night’s raid, according to the director of emergency medicine. Speaking to the BBC over the weekend, Dr Mutaz Harara said: “The medical staff here are completely exhausted, we have no place left for them to sleep in the hospital because we have patients or displaced people piled in every area. ”. The hospital was receiving dozens of patients every day “from what we call the war of hunger”, Harara said. “They are suffering from malnutrition, dehydration and other injuries. And the staff is also now suffering from a lack of food. They are working around the clock and they cannot eat properly or sleep. ”. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
