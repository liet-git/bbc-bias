Diplomacy is all about give and take. But according to several Security Council diplomats, the Arab Group is divided on this text, with some feeling too much was given to the US to gain its support. Jordan and Algeria believe it’s better not to have a resolution at all, than to have this current watered down one. They broadly feel the new wording is akin supporting Israel in its war in Gaza. The UAE wants the draft resolution to be voted on immediately to help increase aid into Gaza, before they vacate their seat on the council at the end of this month. The Palestinians, Egyptians and Saudis are pleased with it and are ready to move forward as well. In a statement to the BBC, the UAE’s Ambassador to the UN, Lana Nusseibeh, said both the coordinator and mechanism have been agreed at very high levels in countries, including the US and Egypt, and will have the backing of the Security Council. "This provides much needed political support for a more senior leader with a mandate to tackle the very aid blockages that are leading to starvation and death in Gaza," she said. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
