John Kirby repeats that the US's decision to abstain from the UN ceasefire resolution "does not represent a shift in our policy". Expanding on remarks he made earlier, he tells reporters at the White House: "We have been very clear, we have been very consistent in our support for a ceasefire as part of a hostage deal. That's how the hostage deal is structured, and the resolution acknowledges the ongoing talks. " He adds the US abstained because the resolution's final text did not condemn Hamas, but adds it does "fairly reflect our view that a ceasefire and the release of hostages come together". Kirby says scheduled meetings between Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant and US national security advisor Jake Sullivan will continue as planned. "We look forward to making it clear to the defence minister that the United States continues to stand with Israel as they fight Hamas". T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
