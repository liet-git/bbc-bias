Here are the key developments from the past 24 hours: Hamas says border crossing chief killed : An Israeli strike killed the head of the Palestinian side of the newly-reopened Kerem Shalom border crossing on Thursday, Hamas authorities in Gaza say. Crossing director Bassem Ghaben and three others were killed in an Israeli air strike, according to the Hamas-controlled crossing authority and the health ministry. Israeli officials did not immediately comment. Gaza death toll rises: The Hamas media office said on Wednesday that at least 20,000 people, including 8,000 children and 6,200 women, have been reported killed since Israel began bombing the territory. North Gaza hospitals not functioning: There are no longer any functional hospitals in northern Gaza, the World Health Organization says, describing "unbearable" scenes of largely abandoned patients begging for food and water. Of Gaza's original 36 hospitals, only nine are now partially functional, all of them in the south. UN Security Council set to vote: It is thought there will be another go at passing a resolution calling for a halt in fighting after previous efforts to win Washington's backing fell short. But the US is seeking more changes in high-level talks. The key sticking point is over the text’s proposal to have a UN mechanism to monitor aid into Gaza – something the Arab group of nations insists must be part of any meaningful resolution. Washington fears that could take away Israel’s control of the screening process. They’ve asked for this latest delay so they can discuss with Egypt how a monitoring mechanism can work for all parties. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
