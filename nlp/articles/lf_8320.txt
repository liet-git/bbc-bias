Israel has cancelled a meeting in Washington after the US – its closest ally - declined to veto a UN Security Council resolution calling for an “immediate” ceasefire in Gaza. The US’s decision allowed the resolution, which also called for the "immediate and unconditional release of all hostages", to pass with the support of all other 14 council members. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused the US of having "abandoned" its previous policy and objected that the resolution did not make the call for a ceasefire conditional on the release of the hostages, as the US and Israel had both argued it should. It follows several failed attempts at similar measures since the 7 October Hamas attacks. You can read more here. Israel Gaza war: Moment UN Security Council passes ceasefire resolution.
