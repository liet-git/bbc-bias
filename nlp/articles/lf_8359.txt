We'll be pausing our live coverage soon but the page will be updated if any major developments break. Before we go, here are Wednesday's key points: According to Hamas, more than 20,000 people in Gaza - almost 1% of the territory's population of 2.2 million - have been killed since 7 October when Hamas launched its surprise attack on Israel and the Israelis hit back. Israeli air strikes and clashes with Hamas continued around the territory including bombing in the southern city of Rafah , near the border with Egypt. Talks in Cairo over a fresh ceasefire did not secure a deal , with a Palestinian source telling the BBC Hamas had rejected proposals for any kind of temporary truce in exchange for releasing hostages held in Gaza. Earlier, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would fight on until Hamas was eliminated. At the UN in New York, a vote on a draft Security Council motion calling for “urgent and extended humanitarian pauses” in Gaza was postponed for the third day in a row. The delays follow tense diplomatic negotiations over the wording of a text to avoid a US veto, with the main sticking point reported to be over the inspection and monitoring of humanitarian aid entering Gaza. Pushing back on criticism of the White House's support for Israel, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called for a strong international voice to condemn Hamas.
