Israel needs to do more to remove barriers to aid entering Gaza and must ensure the smooth distribution once inside, Blinken said, noting the UN says that 90% of Gazans are experiencing food insecurity. Blinken added that the daily toll on civilians in Gaza, particularly on children, is "far too high" He also stated that a Palestinian state is key to any peace plan , and there needs to be regional cooperation in pursuit of that goal.
