T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. David Cameron says "major reform" is needed for Israelâ€™s deconfliction mechanism - a system that allows relief organisations to work in some of the world's hottest conflicts - to ensure the safety of aid workers. The foreign secretary says "we are carefully reviewing the initial findings" of the internal IDF investigation into the air strikes that killed seven aid workers on Monday, and calls for the findings to be published in full. Those findings should be followed up with "a wholly independent review to ensure the utmost transparency and accountability", he writes in a post on X , formerly known as Twitter. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
