Earlier we heard Palestinian media reports that a 16-storey residential tower block had been destroyed in the centre of Khan Younis. BBC Verify has analysed new imagery which shows the Al-Farra Tower missing from the city’s skyline, based on before and after images. The images, which were posted to Telegram at 11:43 Gaza time, were taken from the vicinity of Nasser Hospital looking eastwards. We were able to confirm the location from the distinctive dome and buildings in the extreme foreground. We don’t know exactly when the incident took place. However, separate satellite imagery of Khan Younis shows the tower still standing on 7 January – so it has been destroyed since then. We've also seen a seperate video, which shows smoke rising near where the tower stood - first uploaded to social media this morning at 08:10 Gaza time. The sunrise suggests it was filmed just before. Reports of the tower's destruction on local social media channels also emerged around the same time. Asked if they could confirm they targeted the tower, the IDF said it was “focused on eliminating the threat from the terrorist organization Hamas. Questions of this kind will be looked into at a later stage”. In the 'after' photo, Al-Farra Tower is missing from the city’s skyline. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
