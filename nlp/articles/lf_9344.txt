T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Nagham Atef Mezied, a medical student, has clocked off for the day and explains what it is like in Gaza as day turns to night: I finished my shift at around 17:30 local time (15:30 GMT) and went back home. I wished for a hot shower to release the fatigue of the day, but that of course wasnâ€™t possible as we have no gas and no water. We will try to sort out some dinner now, canned chickpeas and fava beans most probably. The day in Gaza ends early now because we have no internet and no electricity - we have nothing to do and we try to sleep early and have some rest in case the night brings bombs and terror. So we are at least able to cope. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
