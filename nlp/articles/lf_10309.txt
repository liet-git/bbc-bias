T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Dennis Ross, a former US Middle East envoy, tells BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is in a "difficult position" when it comes to agreeing any potential ceasefire deal. Israel's Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir have both said they would quit the government over the terms Israel was prepared to put on the table, Ross says, adding it is an "open question" as to whether they are bluffing. But if the terms Hamas says it will accept are close to what Netanyahu has already agreed to present, Ross says it "won't be so easy for him to turn it down", adding that if Netanyahu was to do so, there is a "high risk" that other figures in the government could leave. "That doesn't bring the government down the way Smotrich and Ben-Gvir would, but it may set in motion a set of events in Israel that I think could put the government at risk," he says. "At a certain point, he needs to choose Biden over Ben-Gvir, he needs to choose the hostages over Smotrich". T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
