As Laura mentioned at the start of this morning's show, today the world is reflecting on two important anniversaries. The first is that it is 75 years since the founding of the defence partnership Nato - the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, of which the UK is a part. And Sunday marks exactly six months since the deadly 7 October Hamas attacks against Israel, in which about 1,200 Israelis were killed and more than 250 others were taken hostage. The attacks led to an Israeli military campaign in Gaza, which has killed more than 33,000 Palestinians, mainly women and children, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. You can read more about that, as well as the latest developments in the conflict, on our other live page here. Elsewhere, the BBC’s chief correspondent Lyse Doucet is presenting a special programme on BBC Two tonight assessing the human cost of six months of conflict, with searing eye witness accounts from both Israel and Gaza.
