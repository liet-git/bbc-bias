It's too early to say that negotiations are under way but there are discussions about talks. Israeli media is reporting that David Barnea, the head of Mossad, Israel's national intelligence agency, has had a meeting with the Qatari Prime Minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani, to discuss a possible future hostage deal. Hamas, which is holding nearly 129 hostages in Gaza, has said there can be no negotiations about hostages until, as they put it, the Israeli aggression against their people stops. The dilemma for the Israeli government is that they don't want to do a ceasefire while they think Hamas is still capable of attacking them, not just with rockets but at some time in the future with a cross border raid, in the way that they did on 7 October. But most of the world is building up a momentum to try and force Israel to stop or at least curtail its military operations, which are killing extraordinary high numbers of Palestinian civilians. They may be killing Hamas fighters, but it's absolutely devastating Gaza everyday. I think that prompted David Cameron, the UK foreign secretary, to write this combined piece with his German counterpart, Annalena Baerbock where they call for a sustainable ceasefire, leading to a sustainable peace. That's a hardening up of the diplomatic language, putting further pressure on the Israeli government to wrap up its military campaign in Gaza. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
