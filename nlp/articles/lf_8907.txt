T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. After days of delays – the vote finally happened and the resolution passed. Thirteen members voted in favour – including the UK. The US and Russia abstained rather than use their vetos to block action. The text had been watered down to get Washington onboard , removing a call for an urgent and sustainable cessation of hostilities – and instead calling for creating conditions for one. Russia objected to the change – saying the council would essentially be giving Israel complete freedom of movement for further clearing of the Gaza Strip. Moscow introduced an amendment to revert to the initial wording. But the US blocked that effort. The UAE’s Ambassador Lana Nusseibeh defended the resolution, despite acknowledging it wasn't perfect. The resolution also creates a coordinator to oversee a UN mechanism that will be set up with the goal of speeding up and streamlining the distribution of aid. Washington initially feared that would take away Israel’s control of the screening process – but the resolution made clear it would be in consultation with all relevant parties. The US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas Greenfield explained why the US still abstained. “Ultimately, while we are encouraged that the Council spoke out on this humanitarian crisis, we're deeply disappointed - appalled, actually - that once again, the Council was not able to condemn Hamas’ horrific terrorist attack on October 7. ”. Several members noted that ultimately – the true test of the resolution will be its implementation on the ground – and whether it does alleviate the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza that gets more desperate by the day.
