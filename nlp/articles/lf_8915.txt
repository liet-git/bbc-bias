So, as we've just been reporting, the UN Security Council has voted i n favour of its aid resolution for Gaza. What is this resolution about? The aim has been to agree a text setting out when and how to bring more aid into Gaza, and when and how to create the conditions for ending or at least pausing the fighting. Disagreement between the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) has focused on Israelâ€™s role in deciding what aid can get in, and whether to call for a ceasefire or cessation or suspension of hostilities. What is a UNSC resolution? It is the formal expression of the will of the 15 members of the Security Council, the primary decision-making body at the UN. There are five permanent members (the US, Russia, China, France and the UK) which have a veto. The other ten members are elected for two-year terms. What can the vote (and its result) actually do? Votes by the UNSC are legally binding. Under the UN Charter, all member states are obligated to carry out the decisions of the council. But Hamas is a non-state actor and is not a member of the UN. And Israel often ignores the organisation which it considers to be institutionally hostile. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
