Iran's third-biggest city, nicknamed "Nesf-e-Jahaan" which translates to "half the world", is located in the centre of the country near the Zagros mountains. The city and its region are home to drone and ballistic missile factories. Relatively nearby is the Natanz nuclear facility, the most important centre for Iran's nuclear enrichment programme. With the name Isfahan tied to Iran's nuclear facilities, the symbolism of an attack there will not have gone unnoticed.
