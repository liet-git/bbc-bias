What the ICJ judges say in the Hague will be watched closely here – even if a defiant Israeli government might not be prepared to admit it publicly. “Nobody will stop us”, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said recently, “not The Hague, not the[Iran-led] axis of evil and not anybody else. ”. When South Africa asked the court to issue provisional measures, Tal Becker, who represented Israel, called it an “unconscionable request” that “seeks to thwart Israel’s inherent right to defend itself. ”. The Israeli government believes a growing number of international institutions are biased against it and are taking the court of international public opinion with them.

Netanyahu convened a meeting with top officials to prepare for the ICJ’s decision.
