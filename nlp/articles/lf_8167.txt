Next up is Sharon Hodgson from Labour, who says she cannot vote for the SNP motion without the Labour amendment. The amendment, she says, provides an opportunity for the whole House to speak with one voice and call for a ceasefire. "We cannot call for a ceasefire without an amendment that understands that Israel cannot be expected to cease fighting while Hamas continues with violence and hostage holding. " A ceasefire must be by definition, she says, two-sided. She says Labour's amendment is a chance for the House to come together and "call for an end to this horrific period of violence".
