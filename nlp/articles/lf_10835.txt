As fierce battles rage on, Israel says dozens of Hamas members have surrendered in northern Gaza where its forces began their ground offensive six weeks ago. Hamas has denied the claims. In the city of Khan Younis, Israeli tanks have now reached the city’s main north-south road and war planes have been attacking an area in the west. It’s thought Hamas leaders may be hiding in the city in south Gaza. Qatar has said it’s continuing efforts to mediate a ceasefire and free more than 100 remaining hostages held by Hamas but is not seeing the same willingness to negotiate as before. Meanwhile, Hamas has issued a threat to Israel that not a single hostage will be allowed to leave Gaza alive unless its demands for a prisoner exchange are met. Palestinian activists are calling for a global strike as part of a coordinated effort to pressure Israel for a ceasefire. Israel has said it cannot end the war now – before achieving its aim of crushing Hamas. Smoke rises in Khan Younis over the weekend after Israeli strikes. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
