EasyJet has confirmed that it has cancelled all flights to Tel Aviv until 27 October. The decision followed the air raids on Israel by Iran at the weekend. The airline had only recently restarted services to the region, after initially suspending them following the Hamas attacks in October. It had been operating about a third of its normal schedule, with flights operating from Luton on a less than daily basis. EasyJet said it had decided to cancel services due to the “continued evolving situation” in Israel. It added that customers with bookings would be offered a full refund. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
