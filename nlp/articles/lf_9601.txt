 F-N-S-T-A-R-T. 9601 F-N-E-N-D.  D-A-T-E-S-T-A-R-T. 2024-05-22 D-A-T-E-E-N-D.  T-I-T-L-E-S-T-A-R-T. Norway's move has not come out of the blue. T-I-T-L-E-E-N-D.  T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Norway's move has been a long time coming and this morning's announcement by Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store is in his words sending a message to other countries to follow suit. We know that Spain and Ireland are set to do that too - and Spanish PM Pedro Sánchez visited Norway and Ireland last month in an attempt to co-ordinate such a move. Norway has long supported a two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinians and mediated the highly secretive talks that led to the 1993 Oslo Accords that resulted in limited self-rule by the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and Gaza. Last November, Norway's parliament, the Storting, voted to support a move calling on Jonas Gahr Store's centre-left government to “be prepared to recognise Palestine" as a state. Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eid has spoken of the war in Gaza as a drama that has to be met with an "irreversible path towards a settlement". But he has also said recognition of a Palestinian state is "not an outcome - it's a tool to help something to happen". "We don't want a 'Hamas state'," he was quoted as saying last month, but a Palestinian state that comes from the Palestinian Authority. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
