Residents of the southern city of Khan Younis at the heart of Israel’s southern offensive in Gaza, have told me fierce fighting continued through the night and is still ongoing. “There’s been violent shelling and clashes,” says Amer, who has moved to the Nasser Hospital for shelter. “There’s been a noticeable advance of Israeli tanks nearby. ”. Medics at the hospital report some 15 members of the Hamdan family were killed and 20 wounded in western Khan Younis yesterday evening. A few hours later, 10 people were injured in an air strike at the home of the Qudra family. Since dawn, members of the Wafi and Wadi families have been killed also in the west of the city. “People came as body parts.  They were unrecognisable,” Dr Mohammed Abu Lahiya tells me. Some of the casualties that arrived this morning were untreatable. Other patients have been dying when we’re trying to perform surgeries because of the lack of medical supplies. Dr Mohammed Abu Lahiya. "We have little anaesthetic. We ran out of blood and the poor phone lines mean we can’t even call other doctors when we need them to come to help. "The route to the hospital is becoming more dangerous. " Medical staff paid tribute to Palestinians killed in Israeli strikes, outside Nasser hospital. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
