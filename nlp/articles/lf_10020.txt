Good morning and welcome back to our live coverage. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has warned members not to further escalate tensions with reprisals against Iran, saying that the Middle East is already "on the brink". Speaking at the Security Council on Sunday evening, he said: "The people of the region are confronting a real danger of a devastating full-scale conflict. Now is the time to defuse and de-escalate. Neither the region nor the world can afford more war. " At the same meeting, Israel’s UN envoy urged the Security Council to impose “all possible sanctions” against Iran after the nation’s unprecedented attacks. More than 300 drones and missiles were fired at Israel overnight on Saturday, which Iran said was in response to an 1 April strike on its consulate in Syria. Almost all were shot down before reaching their targets. "Today the council must take action (and) condemn Iran for their terror," said Israel ambassador Gilan Erdan at the heated meeting. For now, all eyes are on Israel as it weighs possible responses to the attack. Stay with us on this page for the latest updates, reaction and analysis. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
