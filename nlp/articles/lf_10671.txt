We first heard from Pakistan on the floor, before the UN representative for Israel, Gilad Erdan, spoke. He called the General Assembly resolution “hypocritical”, saying that it makes no mention of Hamas. The representative says that a ceasefire “will only prolong death and destruction in the region”. “A ceasefire will only benefit the terrorists that steal the humanitarian aid for themselves,” he said, adding that it would be a “death sentence for countless more Israelis and Gazans”.
