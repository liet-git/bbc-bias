Earlier this week, Antony Blinken warned that the entire population of Gaza was experiencing "severe levels of acute food insecurity". "That's the first time an entire population has been so classified," he said, in some of his strongest comments yet in setting out the scale of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Acute food insecurity is when a person's inability to consume adequate food puts their life or livelihood in immediate danger. If unaddressed, it leads to starvation. Blinken called on Hamas to lay down arms, but said Israel needed to prioritise helping those in need. Meanwhile Volker Turk, UN human rights chief, said the catastrophic hunger in Gaza was "human-made and. . . entirely preventable", laying blame on Israel's" extensive restrictions on the entry and distribution of humanitarian aid”. Israel's diplomatic mission to the UN in Geneva said Turk was seeking to blame it for the situation in Gaza, and “completely absolve the responsibility of the UN and Hamas”. "Israel is doing everything it can to flood Gaza with aid, including by land air and sea," it insisted. You can read more about Blinken’s food insecurity warning here . T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
