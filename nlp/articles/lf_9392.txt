It’s nearly five months since Hamas gunmen attacked southern Israel on 7 October, killing at least 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages. Israel’s retaliatory campaign in the Gaza Strip has been ongoing ever since, with at least 29,700 killed in the Palestinian territory so far, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Life has been tough for most people, with a million displaced Palestinians crammed into Rafah after being forced to seek shelter there. Many are living in makeshift shelters in squalid conditions, with scarce access to safe drinking water or food. It’s just after 09:00 in Gaza, and we’re speaking to people in different parts of the territory about what life has felt like to them. Stay with us as we bring you their stories. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
