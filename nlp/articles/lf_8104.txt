I have had conversation with MPs, senior Labour MPs who have great fears for their security. These are being taken seriously by the authorities and in some cases there is police protection. What we are talking about is Labour MPs who voted for the Labour amendment back in November which did not talk about an immediate ceasefire. They were hounded on social media, and we're talking about protests outside homes and that was very much in the mind of Keir Starmer and indeed very much in the mind of the Speaker when he made that statement yesterday. Essentially what he was worried about is that, had he not allowed the Labour amendment yesterday which did call for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire, those Labour MPs would have only had the choice of voting for the SNP motion - which they couldn't do because it talked about how Israel was guilty of collective punishment. Or they could vote for the government motion and that talked about humanitarian pauses. The Speaker felt that you should give those MPs the ability to vote for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in the way they felt comfortable with. A member of the shadow cabinet sent me a lengthy heartfelt text saying: "Hounded on social media? Nick it's so much worse than that. I'm really fearful. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
