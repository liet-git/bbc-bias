While Israel considers its response to Iran's attack over the weekend, the Israeli military says its troops continue to operate in central Gaza. Here's a reminder of the humanitarian situation in the Palestinian enclave: Almost all of Gaza's population - more than 2.3 million people - have been displaced and lack access to sufficient shelter, food, medical services, clean water, and education since Israel's military offensive against Hamas began. At least 33,797 Palestinians have been killed in the conflict, which began after Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October. White House national security spokesman John Kirby said on Monday that aid getting into the Gaza Strip has increased by a large amount in the last few days. The World Food Programme said it has been using a new route to get aid to north Gaza, where it  delivered food parcels and wheat flour through nine convoys. US House Speaker Mike Johnson announced that a vote on a fresh package of military aid for Israel could come as early as Friday. Following warnings that famine is imminent in northern Gaza, the UN said it delivered a four-day fuel supply a bakery in northern Gaza on Sunday to enable it to resume operations in an area, which "has recorded the highest levels of catastrophic hunger in the world" T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
