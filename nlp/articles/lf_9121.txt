T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. The killing of Saleh al-Arouri, the deputy Hamas leader, in Beirut on Tuesday elevated tensions in Lebanon even further, renewing fears of a wider war in the region. The attack hit the southern suburb of Dahiyeh, a stronghold of the powerful Lebanese Shia movement Hezbollah. In a speech yesterday, Hasan Nasrallah, the influential Hezbollah leader, described it as a "flagrant Israeli aggression" that could not go unpunished. Strong words, as expected, but no clear threat to act against Israel. The attack was a blow to Hamas and probably a message to Hezbollah: even areas controlled by the group could be targeted. Since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in October, Hezbollah and the Israeli military have exchanged attacks almost every day but, so far, the violence has been largely contained to the Lebanon-Israel border. Hezbollah has calculated its actions to prevent another full-scale war with Israel. Many here still remember the devastation caused by the last one, in 2006, and with Lebanon suffering a massive economic crisis, there is no public support for any military confrontation. Israeli authorities have warned Hezbollah that it could do to Beirut what it has done to Gaza, and some senior officials have supported further action against the group to reduce the threat to Israeli communities near the border.
