Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says the war in Gaza will not stop until Israel achieves all of its goals. "The choice I propose to Hamas is very simple: surrender or die," he says. "They do not have – and will not have – any other choice. And after we eliminate Hamas, I will use all my power to ensure that Gaza never again threatens Israel – neither Hamastan nor Fatahstan. " The above comments were translated, with Netanyahu giving the statement in Hebrew. Hamastan and Fatahstan references two Palestinian groups: Hamas, the Palestinian group which has run Gaza since 2007 - and the political party Fatah, which is the ruling party of the West Bank and a bitter rival of Hamas. The plan for what becomes of the enclave and its 2 million inhabitants after the war ends remains unknown. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
