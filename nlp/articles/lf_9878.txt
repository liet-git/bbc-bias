T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. "Efforts to produce an enduring end to the crisis" in Gaza is top of the agenda for today’s talks between President Joe Biden and Jordan's King Abdullah II, says the White House. The Biden administration has been working for weeks to try to secure a pause in the fighting and the release of hostages held in Gaza. King Abdullah is the first Arab leader to visit the White House since the war began. A key figure in the negotiations, he has  repeatedly called for an immediate ceasefire  and the delivery of more humanitarian aid into Gaza. Both men are deeply concerned about the possibility of a fully-fledged military operation in Rafah. When President Biden spoke on the phone to Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu yesterday, he insisted there needed to be a "credible" plan to protect civilians before any military action takes place. The president is clearly becoming increasingly frustrated with the Israeli leader. In public, he has described Israel’s conduct of the war as over the top. In private, it is reported that he has named Netanyahu as the primary obstacle in trying to persuade Israel to change tactics and agree to a ceasefire.
