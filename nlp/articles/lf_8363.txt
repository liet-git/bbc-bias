T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Starbucks has published a letter calling for peace and blaming "misrepresentation" of its views for vandalism of its stores. The message from boss Laxman Narasimhan comes as the coffee giant grapples with protests and boycott campaigns on social media tied to the Israel-Gaza war and a union fight in the US. In the letter to staff, which was posted on the firm's website, Narasimhan did not mention the Middle East explicitly but said that "conflicts in many parts" had unleashed violence, hate, lies and weaponized speech, "all of which we condemn". "Cities around the world - including here in North America - have seen escalating protests. Many of our stores have experienced incidents of vandalism. We see protestors influenced by misrepresentation on social media of what we stand for," he said. He added: "Our stance is clear. We stand for humanity. " Starbucks was vaulted into debates over the Middle East when the union working to organise baristas in the US posted a message on social media expressing "solidarity" with the Palestinians shortly after the 7 October attack by Hamas. The post, which the union said was not authorised by leaders, spread rapidly despite being taken down, and sparked backlash against the firm. Starbucks said it disagreed with the union's statement. It has described its official position as condemning "violence in the region". You can read the full story here. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
