T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Leader of the House of Commons Penny Mordaunt is back up. She asks all members not to do the Commons "a further disservice by suggesting that the shameful events that took place yesterday were anything other than party politics". Addressing her shadow counterpart Lucy Powell directly, Mordaunt says: "If she cannot rise above narrow and immediate needs of her weak and fickle leader . . . perhaps she might like to reflect on the damage her party has done to the office of the Speaker". "I would never have done to him what the Labour party have done to him," she adds. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
