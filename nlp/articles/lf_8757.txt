UK Foreign Minister David Cameron says the strike in Rafah on Sunday looked "very, very concerning, very worrying". "Weâ€™re asking for that to be investigated rapidly," he told reporters, adding that the Israelis "already said it was a tragic mistake". Cameron says he wants to see a pause in the fighting, hostages released and for aid to be let in to Gaza, and then a ceasefire. He adds that he supports a two-state solution to the conflict, but says that it shouldn't come "at the start of this process". T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
