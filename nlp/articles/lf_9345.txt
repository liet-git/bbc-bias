We spoke to Salah Ahmed earlier , a tech entrepreneur who runs a hub in Rafah that allows people to access the internet amid the fighting. Here, he tells us a bit more about his initiative: We came up with this idea for the Hope Hub - a space for tech freelancers to get internet access - because we thought we should provide people with the opportunity to continue working. A lot of freelancers lost their work when the war began. Some friends helped me to establish the initiative, they funded it for three months. The staff here are working for free. I provide them with internet for free and we have electricity from solar panels. We are trying to create a productive environment where people can work and feel comfort. We have graphic designers, motion graphics designers, programmers, content writers, digital marketers. The internet is slow but it's working. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
