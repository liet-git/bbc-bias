Jewish people in Tel Aviv have been observing the start of Hanukkah, the Jewish Festival of Lights, by holding an event to highlight the hostages still being held in Gaza. Hanukkah, or Chanukah as it is also known, runs from 7 to 15 December this year. The word Hanukkah means rededication and commemorates the Jews' struggle for religious freedom. Hanukkah dates back to two centuries before the beginning of Christianity and begins on the 25th day of Kislev, a month which occurs in November and December on the Gregorian calendar. The festival will be marked by Jews across the world with the president of the Union of Jewish Students in the UK, Edward Isaacs, saying it will be "more pertinent than ever before" this year. In Germany, Chancellor Olaf Scholz attended a ceremony to light the first candle in a giant menorah at Berlinâ€™s Brandenburg Gate. It was the first time that a German chancellor had attended the annual event and it comes amid a rise in anti-Semitic incidents in the country. There's a sombre note to this year's festival, as 138 people are still held captive by Hamas and other armed groups in Gaza. This dinner table with empty chairs in Tel Aviv was set up to represent the hostages. As part of the event, people lit a candle for each of the 138 captives. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (R) lights a candle next to Chairman of the Jewish Education Center Chabad Rabbi Yehuda Teichta. In Ukraine's capital Kyiv, a giant candelabra known as a menorah, has been set up in Independence Square. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
