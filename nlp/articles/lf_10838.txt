T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Hamas has warned that no hostages would leave Gaza alive unless its demands were met. "Neither the fascist enemy and its arrogant leadership. . . nor the supporters behind them. . . can take their prisoners alive without exchanging, negotiating, and agreeing to the terms of the resistance," Hamas spokesman Abu Obeida said in an audio clip posted on Sunday on the military wing's Telegram channel. Pressure has been growing on officials over the 138 people still being held by Hamas and other armed groups. Israel has repeatedly pledged to do everything it can to rescue the remaining hostages. Some 110 hostages have been released in total - but a week-long truce under which dozens were freed ended last week and since then Israel has resumed its bombing of Gaza. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
