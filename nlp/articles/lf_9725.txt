If you're just joining us, our coverage in the latter part of the morning focused on the Israeli military's sacking of two senior officers after seven World Central Kitchen (WCK) aid workers were killed in a strike in Gaza on Monday. It forms part of an initial inquiry into the incident - being carried out by retired Israeli military Maj Gen Yoav Har-Even - which drew condemnation from leaders around the world. Here's some of the latest developments: As well as sacking two officers, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) admitted that its drone operators mistook an aid worker carrying a bag for a gunman and proceeded to target a van belonging to WCK. The inquiry found that the IDF unit involved believed the three WCK vehicles eventually targeted with missiles had been taken over by Hamas gunmen. All evidence from the initial review has been passed to the Israeli military's top legal authority to determine if there has been any criminal conduct , the IDF says. WCK has called for an "independent commission" , saying the Israeli military "cannot credibly investigate its own failure" Meanwhile, Benjamin Netanyahu remains under pressure over aid after it was announced last night that two humanitarian routes into Gaza - the Erez Gate and Ashdod Port - had been opened. It came hours after US President Joe Biden told Netanyahu that Israel must take steps to prevent civilian harm and humanitarian suffering if it wants to maintain US support. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
