The UK is working with allies to "de-escalate the situation" following Iran's attack on Israel at the weekend, a spokesman for Prime Minister Rishi Sunak says. The PM has not yet been able to speak to his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu, he says, as Netanhayu was "very busy with war cabinet and engagements". But the UK's foreign and defence secretaries have been speaking to their counterparts, he said. Sunak told MPs on Monday that he would offer support to Israel, adding "all sides must show restraint". His spokesman denied that Israel was refusing to speak to Western allies, saying Sunak would speak to him "as soon as possible". T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
