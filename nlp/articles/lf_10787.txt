A quick reminder that the current conflict in Gaza began when hundreds of members of Hamas crossed from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel on 7 October, killing 1,200 people, mainly civilians, and taking about 240 hostages back to Gaza. Israel launched a widespread military campaign in the territory in response, vowing to destroy Hamas in the process. In the months since war broke out, some 26,000 people, mainly women and children, have been killed in Gaza, and more than 60,000 have been injured, according to the Hamas-run health ministry there. Correction 13 February: This post wrongly reported that about 1,300 people had been killed following the 7 October attack by Hamas. This was based on counting those who later died from their injuries in addition to the figure of more than 1,200. The article has been amended to now refer to about 1,200 deaths, a figure which includes those deaths and which Israel says is not final. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
