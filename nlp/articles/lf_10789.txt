 F-N-S-T-A-R-T. 10789 F-N-E-N-D.  D-A-T-E-S-T-A-R-T. 2024-01-26 D-A-T-E-E-N-D.  T-I-T-L-E-S-T-A-R-T. ICJ to rule on call for Israel to stop military action. T-I-T-L-E-E-N-D.  T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage. Today, the UN's top court could issue emergency measures ordering Israel to halt its military operations in Gaza. The session of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) is part of a case brought by South Africa alleging that Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians. Both South Africa and Israel testified when the case opened two weeks ago, and today judges will consider South Africa’s request for “provisional measures” against Israel. Israel has vehemently rejected the allegation. A ruling against it is not enforceable by the court but would be politically significant. We'll be bringing you the latest developments ahead of the court session at midday, so stay with us. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
