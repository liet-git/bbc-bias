At least 140 countries have recognised a Palestinian state, according to a recent letter to the UN. That includes members of the 22-nation Arab Group at the United Nations, the 57-nation Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and the 120-member Non-Aligned Movement. The UK and the US are among nations that do not formally recognise a Palestinian state. Earlier this year , foreign secretary Lord Cameron suggested that the government, alongside its allies, could “look at the issue of recognising a Palestinian state, including at the United Nations”. Israel does not recognise Palestinian statehood and the current Israeli government opposes the creation of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza. It argues such a state would be a threat to Israel's existence. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
