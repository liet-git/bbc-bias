Starmer presses on, saying Kemi Badenoch categorically denied the claims about compensation to postmasters being delayed. However, he says a note from Staunton published this morning "appears to directly contradict that". He asks the PM to investigate this properly, and asks "why, rather than taking those accusations seriously, she accused a whistleblower of lying?" T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
