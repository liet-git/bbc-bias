T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Many will be wondering if the United Nations resolution is passed - what difference will it make? To give a perspective of what is happening in Gaza right now, United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) spokesperson Juliette Touma told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme the situation is "bone chilling". "We are now at the point where a quarter of the population are reportedly starving," she said. "This is a direct result of the siege and the lack of availability in basic supplies including food. "What is needed right now is a humanitarian ceasefire and an increase of humanitarian aid into the Gaza strip. "When I was there recently people were only talking about that. They are terrified, fatigued, exhausted. They live in fear and the bombardment continues nonstop. It is time for a humanitarian ceasefire. " Juliette Touma. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
