T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. This morning, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with Russian leader Vladimir Putin – with Netanyahu saying he wasn’t satisfied with Moscow’s position on the war in Gaza. Russia backed a resolution to call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza at the UN Security Council on Friday. During the phone call, Netanyahu criticised the “dangerous cooperation” between Russia and Iran, and said that any other country which suffered an attack equivalent to the one Israel suffered on 7 October would have reacted with at least the same force. The Israeli prime minister relayed his appreciation for Moscow's efforts to free Russian dual nationals being held hostage in Gaza. The Kremlin says Russia is ready to give all possible assistance to de-escalate the conflict, and that Putin “reaffirmed the principle position of rejecting and condemning terrorism in all its forms.
