T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. We've just received a voice note from Sami Abu Omar, 59, who is currently sheltering in Rafah having fled from Khan Younis. He tells us: It was a hard night. There was intense bombing. Any person in this situation has to get used to sleeping for an hour to an hour and a half only. I woke at 5am and prayed at dawn and then got ready for my volunteer work. We woke up to a new day, hoping it would be a better day than yesterday. I work in humanitarian aid. We started our day by cooking to help the displaced families in Rafah. We are hoping to do 2,200 meals for these families today. The weather today is slightly cold. There is a possibility of rain falling. We are preparing lentil soup that will be distributed to the displaced families because they are in need. I am one of these families. I have been displaced from more than one place. I dream of going back to my home, safe and sound. The situation is becoming so hard, especially in Rafah. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
