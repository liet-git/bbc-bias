The BBC's Nick Robinson finishes the interview by asking whether the real risk in this war is Western governments supporting Israel when it's under attack, which then empowers it to go too far in its response. Cameron says he doesn't think that's right "at all" - and repeats that the true "malign influence" in the region is Iran, which he says backs groups like Hamas. The UK's foreign secretary adds: "What we have to do with allies is win the argument in the broader global environment about who is really the aggressor here - but also make sure we try and de-escalate the situation so there isn't further loss of life and suffering. " That's the interview done - stay tuned for a round-up of what we've heard from Cameron this morning. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
