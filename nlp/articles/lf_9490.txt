 F-N-S-T-A-R-T. 9490 F-N-E-N-D.  D-A-T-E-S-T-A-R-T. 2024-04-03 D-A-T-E-E-N-D.  T-I-T-L-E-S-T-A-R-T. Gaza left without desperately needed food supplies. T-I-T-L-E-E-N-D.  T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. In terms of exactly what happened, we know that this was a precise strike on this convoy of three vehicles, two of them armoured and bearing on their roofs the large, distinctive saucepan logo of World Central Kitchen (WCK). This team had just left a warehouse, where they had been unloading 100 tonnes of food aid that had just arrived by sea. The Israeli military is claiming that this was a mistake resulting from poor co-ordination between troops in the field and aid organisation officials. But there are big questions about what went wrong. Israel’s prime minister said “this happens in war” and that “a thorough inquiry” was being conducted to prevent a recurrence. But there are some Israeli media reports - such as in Haaretz newspaper – suggesting that this also shows there was also poor discipline with officers and soldiers violating regulations and orders. There is now growing international pressure for better mechanisms so that humanitarian workers can operate effectively and safely. Some Gazans have woken up wondering how they are going to feed their children today without WCK - they had 67 kitchens across Gaza, serving some 350,000 people a day but those operations are now suspended. When it comes to the maritime route bringing in aid from Cyprus, there is now an awful situation where some 240 tonnes of desperately needed food supplies are being sent back to Larnaca port. WCK had only offloaded one barge from a four-vessel flotilla which had just arrived off the coast of Gaza when they came under attack.  For now, there is nobody else who can bring that aid in by sea.
