Residents in Gaza said that Israeli aircraft and tanks continued strikes in the south of the enclave overnight, a day after Israel said it would start withdrawing some of its troops. Israeli ministers say the war in Gaza will continue for many months but the partial troop withdrawal signals a new phase in the offensive, with an official saying Israel would change strategy to more localised "mopping up" operations. The US said this signalled a gradual shift to lower intensity operations in the north of the enclave. Palestinians stand in a house destroyed by an Israeli strike. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
