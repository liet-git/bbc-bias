BBC Verify is examining a video posted by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) this morning. The video is an edit of several pieces of aerial footage as well as footage from a camera inside a moving vehicle. It claims to show gunfire towards IDF troops from al-Shifa hospital buildings and an armoured vehicle being struck by an explosive device. We've matched up most of the footage with buildings in and around the al-Shifa hospital complex. Further information about the video – known as metadata – suggests the clips were captured in the early hours of the morning. However, the large number of edits, the poor quality (blurry, grainy and low resolution) and a lack of recent satellite imagery of the area, means it is tricky to confidently draw conclusions from it. BBC Verify is gathering and analysing other video that claims to show the events at al-Shifa hospital. BBC Verify has matched a frame from the IDF video, showing an entrance to the al-Shifa complex, with the same location on Google Maps. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
