More now from Washington, where President Joe Biden has said that the US is "committed to Israel's security", adding that he wants to prevent the conflict in the Middle East from escalating. "Iran launched an unprecedented aerial attack against Israel, and we launched an unprecedented military effort to defend it. Together with our partners, we defended that attack," Biden said as he met Iraq's visiting prime minister. "The United States is committed to Israel's security. We're committed to a ceasefire that will bring the hostages home and prevent the conflict from spreading beyond what it already has," he said. Meanwhile, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller says that Israel has moved in a "significant way" but Hamas is "the barrier to a deal" that would see fighting in Gaza paused and hostages released. Hamas earlier rejected another proposal for a deal and has asked for an end to the war in Gaza and withdrawal of all Israeli forces. Miller added that the US was still pursuing a deal that would allow for a ceasefire lasting at least six weeks and allow more aid into Gaza. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
