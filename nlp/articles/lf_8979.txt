T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Also making the headlines over the weekend is the former prime minister Boris Johnson, who has said he believes it is "shameful" to call for the UK to end arms sales to Israel. Three Britons were among the seven aid workers killed in air strikes in Gaza, which were carried out by Israel's army on Monday . The strikes have led the Lib Dems, SNP and some Labour and Conservative MPs to urge the UK to reassess how it supports Israel. The Foreign Office has said it keeps advice on Israel's adherence to the law under review, and adds that this is confidential. Writing in his Daily Mail column, Johnson has said it would be "insane" for the UK to end military support, which he says would be "willing the military defeat of Israel and the victory of Hamas". Johnson, a former foreign secretary, wrote: "Remember that in order to win this conflict, Hamas only has to survive. All they need at the end is to hang on, rebuild, and go again. " More than 600 lawyers, including former Supreme Court justices, this week wrote to the government saying weapon exports to Israel must end because the UK risks breaking international law over a "plausible risk of genocide" in Gaza. Israel has rejected the claim of genocide as "wholly unfounded". Read more on this story here.
