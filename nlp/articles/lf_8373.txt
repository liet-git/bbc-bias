We’ve just heard from the UAE, which authored the draft UN Security Council resolution. Their ambassador to the UN, Lana Nusseibeh, addressed the vote’s delay, after numerous previous postponements. She said discussions are continuing at the highest levels in capitals with leverage and they decided to “give space for additional diplomacy to try and yield positive results". She said the goal was always to have a resolution with impact pass, and that they have to keep trying because there is too much suffering on the ground to have the council fail on this. This is high stakes diplomacy. The US does not want to be in a position to veto another resolution and the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza is putting immense pressure on the council to act. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was asked if the US would veto this proposal, he said they are working to ensure the aid getting in to Gaza wouldn't be complicated by any efforts at the UN. According to a western Security Council diplomat, Egypt and the US are now engaging directly to ensure any aid monitoring mechanism can work for all parties. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
