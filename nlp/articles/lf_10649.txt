Israel can’t ignore the Americans – it’s not just the military aid and financial help they supply, it’s diplomatic cover. If the Americans abstained on a successful ceasefire vote in the UN Security Council and the Israelis continued fighting, they would be in a very, very difficult position internationally. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is taking a very hard line against American proposals to include the Palestinian Authority in the plans for what happens after the conflict in Gaza. And in the Israeli press this morning there are a lot of commentators saying that he is basically grandstanding and playing to his own base because he is in deep political trouble as a result of criticisms that his government’s lapses in security and intelligence led to the Oct 7th attacks.
