Izzat Abdullah Al Jamal tells us he has been displaced twice since the war began and no longer trusts that there is any "safe place" in Gaza. Izzat, 55, fled from his home in the northern Gaza city of Jabalia, seeking shelter in al-Shifa hospital before fleeing on foot to the southern city of Khan Younis. "The people in Khan Younis are very kind and generous but the area is overcrowded with refugees and there is strong bombing," he says. Like others we've been speaking to there, Izzat says he "wonâ€™t move" again. "I don't have any place to go - they told us to move from the north and we came to the south. . . Where should we go? There is no safe place to go. " As we've been reporting, Israeli tanks are pushing deeper into Khan Younis, where Israel believes Hamas leaders could be hiding. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
