More international reaction to the ICC's announcement now, this time from the UK prime minister. A spokesperson for Rishi Sunak says the ICC prosecutor's decision to seek arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli and Hamas leaders is unhelpful. "This action is not helpful in relation to reaching a pause in the fighting, getting hostages out or getting humanitarian aid in," the spokesperson said. Earlier, a spokesperson for the government said: "As we have said from the outset, we do not think the ICC has jurisdiction in this case. The UK has not yet recognised Palestine as a state, and Israel is not a state party to the Rome Statute [ICC]," the spokesperson adds. Earlier this year, the UK government criticised a case brought by South Africa to the International Court of Justice accusing Israel of genocide in the Gaza war - you can read more about that case and the ICJ's ruling here. As a reminder the ICJ handles disputes between states, while the ICC deals with individuals. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
