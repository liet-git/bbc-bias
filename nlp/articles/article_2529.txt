The Home Office is investigating after a baby's birth certificate was returned with the word "Israel" crossed out in a passport application. The Campaign Against Antisemitism (CAA) shared an image on X of the document, which also shows signs of being torn. The baby's parents' birth places were listed as Israel, with the father's being crossed out. The CAA said the "completely unacceptable" incident had left the child's parents "very concerned". The mother's place of birth - also Israel, according to the image - is untouched on the document. Home Secretary James Cleverly replied to the post on X, external (formerly Twitter) saying he had asked officials to "investigate this urgently" and see that "appropriate action is taken". Security Minister Tom Tugendhat also confirmed that the Home Office was looking into the matter. The CAA said the certificate had been sent to the Home Office as part of a passport application by a parent for his six-month-old girl. The Home Office is responsible for the "security of the Jewish community", the campaign group said, adding that confidence in the authorities was already "at painfully low levels" and needed to be restored. A spokesperson for the CAA said that an application should not be returned "torn, with the parent's place of birth scribbled out, just because it is the Jewish state". In response to Mr Cleverly's tweet, the CAA posted on X, thanking him for his "swift response". The BBC has contacted the Home Office for comment, and was directed to Mr Cleverly's reply on X to the original post.  T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
