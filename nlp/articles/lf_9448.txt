T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. We've reported that World Central Kitchen (WCK) founder José Andrés says he thinks Israel deliberately targeted his aid workers . Now, a spokesperson for Cogat - the Israeli defence ministry body in charge of co-ordinating aid deliveries to Gaza and liaising between the aid agencies and the Israeli military - insists there wasn’t a problem with the information they passed on to the IDF about the convoy’s movements. Speaking to BBC's Newshour programme, Cogat spokesman Shimon Freedman says the strike on the aid workers was a "grave mistake" and an “absolute tragedy”. “It was a mistake that followed a misidentification but we’ve set up an independent professional body to look into the incident and investigate. " He adds that he does not think there was a systemic problem because the IDF co-ordinates with aid agencies on the ground every day as a matter of course. "There are dozens of co-ordinations a day and hundreds of thousands of co-ordinations that have happened since the beginning of the war. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
