Back in the Commons chamber, business as normal is slowly returning after the scenes yesterday, and as we reported a little earlier - questions to the Commons Leader Penny Mordaunt have wrapped up. Just before they did, we heard from a few more MPs about what happened yesterday. Here's a quick round-up of what was said: Tory MP Anna Firth , who succeeded Sir David Amess as the representative of Southend West after he was killed during a constituency surgery in 2021 , thanked Lindsay Hoyle for his apology and said he had been a "great help and support" to her and the Amess family. SNP MP David Linden got up to say it was with "huge regret" he had signed the motion indicating he has no confidence in Hoyle - he said he likes the speaker on a personal level but Hoyle "can't object" to the views being expressed by MPs. Another Conservative, Brendan Clarke-Smith asked why no division was called in the vote yesterday, insisting there were calls of no as well as aye. Deputy Speaker Dame Eleanor Laing said she had spoken to Dame Rosie Winterton - who was presiding over the vote - and been assured she could not hear any calls of no due to the level of noise in the Commons.
