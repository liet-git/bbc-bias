We're hearing from Prime Minister Rishi Sunak now. He condemns Iran's attack on Israel last night, and confirms UK jets shot down a number of Iranian attack drones. The UK participated in an “international coordinated effort” to intercept the missiles and drones Iran fired, he says. “The RAF sent additional planes to the region,” he adds.
