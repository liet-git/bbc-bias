Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has acknowledged his government disagrees with the Biden administration over the fate of Gaza after the war. Netanyahu said he greatly appreciated support from the Biden administration for the aim of destroying Hamas and recovering hostages but repeated his opposition to the Gaza strip being ruled by Hamas or Fatah, the faction currently governing the West Bank. "Yes, there is disagreement about 'the day after Hamas' and I hope that we will reach agreement here as well," said Netanyahu. "After the great sacrifice of our civilians and our soldiers, I will not allow the entry into Gaza of those who educate for terrorism, support terrorism and finance terrorism. " On Monday, US President Joe Biden said Washington and Israel had different views on a post-war Gaza.  Netanyahu said he would not allow Israel to repeat "the mistake of Oslo", referring to the Oslo accords in the 1990s, which established Palestinian authority in the West Bank and Gaza. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
