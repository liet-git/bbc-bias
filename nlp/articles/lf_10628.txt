Since the war in Gaza began, Israel's military operations in the occupied West Bank have become more frequent, and more forceful. One place that has become a weekly battleground is Jenin, and the director of the city's hospital says these attacks "will make the people more and more angry". "This will not bring peace for Israel - this will bring more and more resistance," Wissam Bakr says. The UN says here in the West Bank, 271 Palestinians, including 69 children, have been killed since Hamas's 7 October attack - almost all of these have been killed by Israeli forces. Israel says its operations in the West Bank are targeting members of armed groups, often those with Israeli blood on their hands. Since the Hamas attack, support for armed resistance has risen in many parts of the West Bank - including here in Jenin. It was a "turning point" for Palestinians, just as it was for Israelis, the youth leader for the West Bank's ruling party told me. "The people, especially the new generation, are backing Hamas now, more than at any other moment. " You can read more about Hamas's rising support in the West Bank here . T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
