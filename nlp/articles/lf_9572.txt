Video shot at Deir al-Balah hospital in central Gaza shows the bodies of several aid workers and their foreign passports. They’re wearing clothing including bullet proof vests bearing the World Central Kitchen logo. The organisation has been involved in sending the first aid to the war-torn territory by sea from Cyprus. Their convoy is said to have coordinated its movements with the Israeli military when it was hit. The CEO of World Central Kitchen, Erin Gore, said it was an “unforgiveable attack” on humanitarian organisations showing up in the most dire of situations. The charity is now pausing its operations and says it will make decisions about the future of its work soon. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
