It is 09:30 in Israel, and the country is waking up after a long and tense night with an unprecedented attack by Iran. For the first time ever, Iran carried out strikes against Israeli territory. In the middle of the night, air raid alerts went off, residents were urged to seek shelter while explosions were heard as air defence was activated. Interceptions lit up the dark sky in several places across the country. The air space was reopened this morning, an indication that the immediate threat is over. But Defence Minister Yoav Gallant has said the confrontation with Iran was “not over yet”. The question now is about a possible Israeli reaction. Israeli authorities have vowed to retaliate to any direct attack from Iran, and the country’s war cabinet met overnight to discuss the situation. Iran, meanwhile, has warned of a severe response. Tensions between Israel and Iran have been high for decades, but this is a dangerous moment that could see the two enemies in open confrontation. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
