The United States would object to a buffer zone inside the Gaza Strip, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said at a press briefing on Wednesday. No reduction in territory figures among the five principles that the US has said would guide their approach for Gaza after the war, along with no forcible displacement, no reoccupation, no siege or blockade and no use of Gaza as a platform for terrorism. "If any proposed buffer zone was inside Gaza, that would be a violation of that principle and something we oppose. If it’s with respect to something within Israeli territory I won't speak to that - that’s a decision for the Israelis to make," Miller said. Israel informed several Arab states and Turkey last week that it had plans to introduce a buffer zone on the Palestinian side of Gaza's border to prevent future attacks, Reuters news agency reported.
