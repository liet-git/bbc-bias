T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Hassan Nasrallah's speech has now finished, but towards the end he described yesterday's killing of Hamas deputy chief Saleh al-Arouri in Beirut as "dangerous". He added: "It's the first time something like this has happened since 2006" - when there was war between Hezbollah and Israel. Nasrallah addressed the Israeli defence minister saying he will "not be able to achieve their goals of the war". "We are not afraid of war. Those who think of going to war with us will regret it. War with us will come at a very high cost. " He also added that if Israel wages war on Lebanon "there will be no ceilings, no rules" to Hezbollah's fighting. Nasrallah finished his speech saying: "Yesterday's crime will not go unpunished. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
