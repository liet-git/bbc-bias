Families of Israeli hostages - who have now been held in Gaza for 68 days - have formed a human chain in front of Israel's parliament (Knesset) in Jerusalem, demanding action from the Israeli government for their safe release. Naama Weinberg, the cousin of Israeli hostage Itai Svirsky, 38, says a new deal is needed "before it's too late". "We came to Jerusalem to remind our government that there is no time left, and that every day that passes by might be the last day of the hostages while they're alive," she says. She says her cousin was kidnapped after seeing his mother being murdered by Hamas on 7 October, and his father was murdered half an hour before at a different house. "Every day we hear about new names and new hostages that came there alive and now they're taken out as bodies. " Merav Leshem Gonan, whose 23-year-old daughter Romi Gonen is held hostage in Gaza, is among the crowd outside the Knesset. "Every morning when I wake up I'm saying good morning to my kids and every night when I go to sleep I say good night to my kids. And there is one kid that does not answer for 68 days, because she's in Gaza," she says. "I'm determined to make sure she will come back alive, Romi and all the hostages, because we as a country need it, not just us as a family. " Naama Weinberg's cousin, Itai Svirsky, is still being held hostage in Gaza. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
