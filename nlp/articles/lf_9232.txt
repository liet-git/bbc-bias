It's almost 23:30 in Israel and Gaza, and 21:30 here in our London newsroom. Here’s a recap of what’s been happening today: Tens      of thousands of Palestinians are making their way to Rafah, in Gaza's      south, to escape intense fighting elsewhere in the southern Gaza Strip. The      BBC's reporter in Gaza, Adnan El-Bursh, says the city has no food or      electricity, and is also contending with severe water shortages. Fighting is continuing in the southern city of Khan Younis - at the start of the war, Palestinians in north Gaza were told to go there. A      video has been circulating on social media showing dozens of Palestinian men,      stripped to their underwear, guarded by Israeli soldiers – other images      show them being transported in military trucks. Israel says the Kerem Shalom crossing into Gaza will open within the next few days, but only for the inspection of aid lorries. The Israeli military has also confirmed the son of a former chief of staff has been killed during its ground operation in Gaza. A camp has been set up in Rafah. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
