The American assessment so far, seems to be that a disastrous failure of "deconfliction" is an underlying factor in Israelâ€™s killing of the international aid workers. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken suggested this in his press conference in Paris saying: "Co-ordination has been a perennial problem, deconfliction, as well as other challenges. " Deconfliction is when aid groups coordinate with the parties to a conflict to ensure safe passage for their staff and supplies. It has been a major issue in Gaza with aid teams complaining Israel has turned back convoys at checkpoints or restricted movement. The procedures are said to be often unclear, unwieldy and slow. Israel denies it has deliberately prevented deliveries and claims Hamas has tried to exploit supplies. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
