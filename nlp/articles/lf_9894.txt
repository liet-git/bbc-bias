We are now in day 129 of our coverage of the Israel-Hamas conflict in the Gaza Strip - let's have a quick look back at the key developments which have been making headlines in the last week or so: Last Tuesday, Hamas delivered its response to the framework for a new ceasefire in Gaza; US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington would review the response and discuss it with Israel during a visit the following day. Blinken met with diplomats in Tel Aviv on Wednesday, but Israel's PM once again insisted he will not settle for anything other than a total victory over Hamas. At the same time there was heightened concern for the welfare of displaced Palestinians crowded in Rafah as Israel prepared to move in on the city. On Saturday, Benjamin Netanyahu told Israel's military to draw up plans to evacuate civilians from southern Gaza before an offensive was launched against Hamas. Aid agencies questioned where they could go ; while the Palestinian presidency accused Israel of planning to expel Gazans from their land. Overnight from Sunday into Monday carried out a series of strikes on Rafah which killed dozens of Palestinians. Separately at the same time, Israel - for only the second time since the war broke out - was able to rescue two male hostages from Rafah. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
