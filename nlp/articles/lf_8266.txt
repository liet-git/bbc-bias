The Conservatives suffered two by-election defeats last week in Wellingborough in Northamptonshire and Kingswood in South Gloucestershire, with Labour overturning big Conservative majorities. In Wellingborough, Labour won Peter Bone’s former seat, which he had held with a majority of more than 18,000. And in Kingswood, the party overturned an 11,220 Conservative majority. Rishi Sunak said there were “particularly challenging” circumstances in the two defeats, and called on the country to "stick with" his government. The results mean the Tories - who are trailing a long way behind Labour in national opinion polls ahead of a general election due this year - have suffered ten by-election losses in this parliament, more than any other government since the 1960s.
