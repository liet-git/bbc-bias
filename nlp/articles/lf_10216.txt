T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. An official from the he United Nations relief agency for Palestinian refugees has described Gaza as becoming "unliveable". Speaking to the BBC News Channel, Juliet Touma from UNRWA says recent bad weather is worsening the already dire conditions in the strip. She says UNRWA have 150 more shelters but need to open more, as the existing ones are "overcrowded and cannot take people any more". Touma goes on to explain people are "resorting to just building shacks‚Äù or living in their cars. She says UNRWA are bringing aid into the region, but adds that the agency is restricted to Rafah because of "heavy bombardment" by Israel. You cannot deliver aid under a sky full of air strikes. We cannot access those who need us most and fulfil our duties. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
