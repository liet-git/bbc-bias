T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. I’ve been talking to young Palestinians in Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, where hundreds of protesters have gathered on the streets around its landmark al-Manara Square. They’re taking part in a global strike called for by pro-Palestinian trade unions and grassroots groups to demand a ceasefire in Gaza. One girl, with the slogan “Gaza Pride” painted on her cheeks in Arabic and wearing a traditional keffiyeh headdress around her shoulders, told me she was marching to stop the war and so that girls as young as her would not be killed. Other slogans included “National Unity”, as Palestinians here expressed their solidarity with those in the Gaza Strip. There were also flags and banners displaying support for Fatah, the leading political faction in the Palestinian Authority, as well as for Hamas, which led the 7 October attack on Israel and is designated a terrorist group by the UK, US, EU and other powers. Another protester, who like many of those present didn’t want to be named, told me that he not only wanted to show his anger at the Israeli authorities, but also at the United States, which vetoed a UN resolution calling for a ceasefire. Politics here is often dominated by men, so what stood out for me was the number of children attending. Some, too young to walk, were carried on the shoulders of their mothers and fathers.
