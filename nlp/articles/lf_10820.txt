T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. The UN's Palestinian refugee agency (Unrwa) has said there is "almost a total breakdown of civil order" around its aid deliveries in Gaza. The BBC asked Juliette Touma, the organisation's director of communications, about videos circulating on social media that some say show members of Hamas intercepting aid trucks. "We've had several incidents, very sadly of course, of our warehouses being broken into and our supplies taken," she says. She says there have also been cases of people who were "simply hungry" who intercepted aid trucks and "ate the food there and then". "If it's an indication of anything, it’s an indication of just how hungry people are," she adds. She was asked about claims by the Israeli military that Hamas members have been sheltering in Unrwa schools and that weapons have been found in bags with the Unrwa logo. She told the BBC that "we’re seeing these reports constantly and we take them very, very seriously", but getting information "becomes very difficult" in places in northern Gaza where Unrwa no longer has access. Touma also said the agency was "seeing people moving multiple times" in a "pattern of forced displacement". One staff member, for example, had moved ten times during the conflict, she said.
