As we've been reporting, Muslims around the world, including those in Gaza, are marking the festival of Eid al-Fitr, which marks the end of the holy month of Ramadan. It is the "festival of breaking the fast" and is usually a period of great celebration, with families and friends coming together and sharing large meals. Many Muslims attend prayers at their mosques in the morning and it is also common for children to receive either money or small gifts from their elders. But in Gaza, the festival is very different this year amid the ongoing conflict between Hamas and Israel. Read more about Eid al-Fitr here .
