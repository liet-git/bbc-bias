Some of the Gazans we've asked to speak to us today have been struggling to survive under intense Israeli bombardment. They come from different parts of the Gaza Strip and some are still trying to practise their professions after forced evacuations. We’re hoping they will able to share their accounts of how dramatically their daily lives have changed throughout the day - but the situation in Gaza could pose connectivity issues, making it difficult for them to keep in touch. They include: Dr Haya Hijazi, an gynaecologist who worked at al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City, was displaced from her home in north Gaza. She’s now living in a tent on the Egypt-Rafah border. An English teacher called Farida Adel who lost contact with her family while fleeing her home in north Gaza to the south with her siblings. Fifth year medical student, Nagham Atef Mezied , who has been volunteering at Al Aqsa hospital in central Gaza. Thirty-year-old fashion designer Yahya Hussen who now stays in a tent with his parents and siblings. Stick with us while we gather as much information as we can. Yahya Hussen with his sister Hana.
