Families of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza have taken to the streets of Tel Aviv to demand the government take the "opportunity" of a truce deal, to bring the hostages back home. The Hostage Families and Missing Families Forum said in a statement, "now is the time for all that are involved to fulfil their commitment and turn this opportunity into a deal for the return of all the hostages". Hamas says it has approved a ceasefire deal for Gaza put forward by Qatari and Egyptian mediators but the terms of the deal are not completely clear and Netanyahu says it is 'far from meeting Israel's demands". The Israeli Prime Minister has said a delegation will go to negotiate further. As our security correspondent Frank Gardner reported earlier , protests in Israel's cities have been ongoing for many months, with many of those taking to the streets saying the don't believe the Israeli government is doing enough. 128 hostages remain unaccounted for, with at least 34 presumed dead following the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October. Protesters also gathered outside the Kirya military headquarters in Tel Aviv. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
