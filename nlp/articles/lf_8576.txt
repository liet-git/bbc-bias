Good morning and welcome back to our coverage of the conflict in the Gaza Strip. Meanwhile, pressure is growing on the UK government to suspend arms sales to Israel after an Israeli air strike killed seven World Central Kitchen (WCK) aid workers in Gaza. More than 600 lawyers have signed a letter arguing that ministers risk breaching international law by continuing to allow the exports. WCK founder Jose Andres had claimed their convoy was deliberately targeted by the Israeli military “car by car”. Israel has dismissed the claims they were targeted deliberately. Later today, US President Joe Biden will speak with Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - in their first direct contact since the seven aid workers were killed. Our teams in London and the Middle East will be bringing you the latest updates and analysis throughout the day, so stay with us. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
