T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. James Grundy , Tory MP for Leigh, says that following an opposition day debate some time ago, his elderly parents were threatened with being stabbed to death, adding that he knows his fellow MPs are facing similar threats today. He implores MPs that when "we do vote on difficult matters, we should do so under the same set of rules". He adds that while Labour MPs were protected "entirely legitimately from potential threats of violence and murder", Conservative MPs "were consequently left more exposed" Mordaunt says she "completely agrees", telling MPs: "I hope all have got that message".
