The Israeli authorities seem to believe an Iranian response is imminent following the strike on an Iranian diplomatic consulate in the Syrian capital, Damascus, that we mentioned in our last post . The attack, widely believed to have been carried out by Israel, killed two Iranian generals and five others. It sparked an angry reaction from Tehran and threats of revenge. On Wednesday, the Israeli military announced it had drafted reservists to boost air defences. This morning, it said it had halted home leave for combat units. Meanwhile, GPS systems were being disrupted in central parts of the country, including areas of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, in an apparent attempt to fend off guided missiles that use those systems. A BBC producer said her GPS had located her in Cairo when she was in Jerusalem. Other users have shared similar accounts on social media. GPS is already disrupted in northern Israel, near the border with Lebanon, where Israel and the Iranian-backed group Hezbollah have exchanged fire almost daily for the last six months. Separately, the Israeli army told the population that there was no need for them to buy generators, gather food or withdraw money, which is likely to be an indication of the mood across the country. Friday is considered to be a particularly sensitive day as it marks Quds Day - or Jerusalem Day - the last Friday in the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
