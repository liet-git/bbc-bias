UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres says he hopes Israel quickly boosts aid access to Gaza, calling the situation in the territory after six months of war as "absolutely desperate". "When the gates to aid are closed, the doors to starvation are opened. More than half the population – over a million people – are facing catastrophic hunger. "Children in Gaza today are dying for lack of food and water. This is incomprehensible, and entirely avoidable," he says. Echoing earlier calls from charity World Central Kitchen, Guterres says fixing failures in Israeli military procedures "requires independent investigations as well as meaningful, measurable changes on the ground". The UN says at least 196 humanitarian workers have been killed since 7 October. "We want to know why each one of them was killed," Guterres says. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
