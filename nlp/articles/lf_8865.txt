The UN Security Council is due to meet in a few hours to vote on whether to call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. It comes two days after UN chief Antonio Guterres took the unpredecented step of invoking Article 99 of the UN's charter . No one in his role has done this in decades. The move allows the secretary-general to bring to the council's attention "any matter which in his opinion may threaten the maintenance of international peace and security". The United Arab Emirates has prepared a draft resolution that will be put to a vote, it needs at least nine votes in favour and no vetoes by the United States, Russia, China, France or Britain to pass.
