T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Let's return to the news that three hostages were mistakenly killed by the IDF in Gaza on Friday. Hen Avigdori, whose wife and daughter were held hostage by Hamas and later released, has posted on X to following the statement from the IDF. He says that he often hears others say that "there is a possibility of rescuing hostages by military means" and "this is not the time". But, he adds: "There is no military way. No time. " The conclusion for every person who has both heart and mind is the same: Israel must initiate a deal to bring them back alive and not in coffins. And now. " Avigdori's wife and 12-year-old daughter were held by Hamas for 50 days. When they were released he said they were “fine physically and emotionally” but his daughter Noam has been waking up screaming in the night. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
