It is another difficult day for civilians in Gaza, as Israel continues its bombardment of the Palestinian enclave. Here's a recap of what's been happening: Israel is attacking targets in both northern and southern Gaza. One of the focal points is Jabalia refugee camp in the north, where Israel maintains Hamas has a stronghold. Al Jazeera reported that one of its journalists had lost 22 family members in an Israeli attack on Jabalia camp yesterday. Israel's military has also advanced into the heart of Khan Younis in southern Gaza, which had been sheltering hundreds of thousands who fled the fighting in the north. No aid has reached the north since the humanitarian truce ended at the start of December. UN chief Antonio Guterres yesterday warned that the humanitarian system in Gaza may collapse and public order could completely break down. His comments were criticised by Israel's foreign minister, who said that Guterres' tenure was a "danger to world peace" Smoke rises above Gaza's Shejaiya neighbourhood following an Israeli air strike.
