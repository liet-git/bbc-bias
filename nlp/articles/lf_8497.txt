During its campaign in Gaza following the 7 October attacks by Hamas, the Israeli army has repeatedly ordered the evacuation of Palestinian civilians from areas where it has carried out its attacks. The southern city of Rafah is the last city where many have taken refuge. Here is a short timeline of the evacuations: 13 October: Israeli army orders civilians who live north of Wadi Gaza , which sits in centre of the strip, to move south. Within two days, hundreds of thousands leave the area, mostly to the city of Khan Younis. 16 November: Israeli military planes drop leaflets in some parts of southern Gaza, including Khan Younis , warning the Palestinians to leave. Israeli officials say safe zones are being created on the southwest Gaza Strip on the Mediterranean coast. Thousands flee there to see there is no water, no infrastructure to provide basic needs, but some makeshift tents. 23 January: The Israeli army orders the evacuation of Khan Younis , where about half a million Gazans are taking shelter . Evacuation orders include the people being treated in the biggest three hospitals in the city. Displaced people mostly take shelter in Rafah. 6 May: The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) orders people in eastern parts of the city of Rafah to evacuate. According to UN figures, 1.7 million people in Gaza have been displaced by the war, with 1.4 million of them crowded into Rafah on the Egyptian border. The Gaza Strip had a population of more than two million before the war. 11 May: The IDF says "approximately 300,000 Gazans have moved towards the humanitarian area in al-Mawasi" since Monday.
