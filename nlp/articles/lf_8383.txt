T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Just before Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu shared his remarks about Israel fighting until Hamas is defeated, his senior adviser told the BBC Israel is open to a new truce deal. As we reported earlier , according to Israeli media reports, Israel has presented a plan to mediators which could secure the release of some 30 to 40 hostages - prioritising the remaining women, as well as men who are elderly or in need of urgent medical care. Asked whether Israel was considering a deal which would involve the release of Palestinian prisoners held in Israel in exchange for hostage releases, Regev said: "We've done it in the past, as you know in late November we had a humanitarian pause in place which involved the release of Israeli hostages. "We let out Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails then, and so if we've done it in the past you can presume we'll do it in the future. He added: "The goal is, of course, in this operation, to have all our people come back. And that remains a central part of our campaign against Hamas. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
