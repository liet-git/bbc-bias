The MSC Aries, a container ship, was visible on vessel-tracking websites more than three days ago sailing about 50 miles (80km) off the coast of the UAE en route to India. It was next seen on Sunday near two Iranian islands in the Strait of Hormuz, in satellite imagery shared by maritime traffic site Tankertrackers. com . BBC Verify has looked at the images and believes they match the length and features of MSC Aries. The 25 crew members are believed to still be on board, the majority of them Indian.
