The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has said 400 plus aid trucks have entered Gaza on each of the last two days. But the UN has said that figure was less than 250 on Monday. But why the different figures? The UN says Israel only counts what it screens and allows over the border, whereas the UN counts the trucks that arrive at their warehouses in Gaza. “It's complicated, and let me be upfront here, we will never get these truck numbers to match,” said the UN’s Jens Laerke. According to the UN, all trucks entering Gaza are checked by Israel. But screening requirements mean they are typically only half full, says the UN. After border checks, goods are moved onto a new set of vetted trucks to travel on into Gaza. These trucks are filled nearer to capacity. This means the number of trucks arriving at UN warehouses is often lower than the original number screened at the border. Israel denies hindering humanitarian relief into Gaza. We’ve asked the Israeli authorities whether they only screen half-full lorries and why, but they haven’t responded. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
