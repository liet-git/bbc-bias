In reply, Sunak welcomes Starmer's support of the government's stance. He says G7 leaders spoke yesterday and agreed to coordinate actions to "counter the Iranian regime and its proxies". He adds that an announcement with details will come "at the appropriate time". Over 400 Iranian individuals have been sanctioned, Sunak says, including the entire Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), and there are new powers, such as a new sanctions regime and national security act, to give the UK government further powers to designate sanctions and combat foreign interference. Sunak says Iran is isolated on the world stage and urges Israel to "take the win at this point and avoid further escalation and bloodshed". "We are absolutely committed to a two-state solution" he says, and says the government is working hard to bring that about. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
