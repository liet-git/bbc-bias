Not long ago we received first reports about a major explosion in Beirut, Lebanon's capital. Here's a quick recap of what we know so far: Hamas has confirmed that Saleh al-Arouri, the deputy head of its political bureau, was killed in the blast in the Dahiyeh neighbourhood of the Lebanese capital on Tuesday night. Hamas, the group that controls the Gaza Strip, has close ties with Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed group with strong ties to the neighbourhood. Three other people have been reported killed in the blast, which Lebanese state media say was caused by an Israeli drone strike. The Israeli military has told the BBC it will not comment on reports in the foreign media. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
