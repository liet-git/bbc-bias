T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. There were bursts of gunfire in the streets around Jenin camp this morning, and a local mosque again called for people to come out in defence of their neighbours in both Jenin and Gaza. This is the third day of Israel’s military operation here. Eleven Palestinians have been killed, including three in a drone strike overnight.  A 13-year-old boy died on Tuesday after waiting in his father’s arms outside the city’s main hospital for the army to let them through. Soldiers have been carrying out house-to-house searches in Jenin Camp since Tuesday, arresting and questioning hundreds of people - most of whom have since been released. The Israeli military said it had confiscated around 30 weapons and other military equipment, and dismantled explosives laboratories, observation points and tunnel shafts. Four soldiers were injured by friendly fire or controlled explosions, it added. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
