T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Israel's Economy Minister Nir Barkat says that it is "nonsense" to suggest that Israel deliberately targeted aid workers. Speaking to the BBC on Wednesday, he was asked about José Andrés’ comments. "With all due respect, there's no way in the world that Israel would target people that come to give people aid,” he answered. Responding to the allegation, Barkat told the BBC's Caitriona Perry: "That's nonsense. I'm sorry, give us a bit of a respect that we care about those people. " A spokesperson for Cogat - the Israeli defence ministry body in charge of co-ordinating aid deliveries to Gaza and liaising between the aid agencies and the Israeli military - insists correct information was passed to the IDF on the convoy's movements.
