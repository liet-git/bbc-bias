Over on the Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme this morning , UK Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden says the government is "engaging with Israel on a number of issues - making sure they are not targeting aid workers", referencing the Israeli air strike that killed seven aid staff earlier this week, including three Britons . Speaking about the state of the war six months on, Dowden says Israel was "subject to the most appalling attack" but adds that more aid must get into Gaza. Asked if Israel is acting within the law, Dowden says Israel is "conducting a legitimate campaign" but later adds, "we have concerns which we have raised with Israel". Dowden says it is “all too easy” for the world to forget the horrors Israel has faced. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
