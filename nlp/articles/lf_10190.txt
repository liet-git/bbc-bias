The White House says it wants the war in Gaza to be over as soon as possible. Visiting Israel, the US national security advisor, Jake Sullivan, said he had discussed with the country’s leadership a transition for the Israeli military to more precise and targeted attacks against Hamas. But no details, including a timetable, have been made public. Under international pressure over the high number of deaths in Gaza, Israel says it needs more time – months, not weeks – to achieve its goal of destroying Hamas. And there are no signs its offensive is slowing down despite growing criticism even from its main ally, the US. Two months of war have killed thousands of Palestinians – more than 18,000, according to the local, Hamas-run, health authorities – and displaced hundreds of thousands of others, while large parts of Gaza now lie in ruins. Those who have not been killed by the bombs are struggling to survive amid widespread shortages of basic supplies and a collapsed health system. Hamas is still fighting back. Reports indicate Israel’s ground offensive is facing intense resistance in northern Gaza, where the military said last month that fighting had diminished, as well as in central areas and in parts of Khan Younis in the south, where the Israeli authorities believe members of the Hamas leadership are hiding. Israel says around 7,000 Hamas fighters have been killed so far, from an estimated 20,000 the group had before the war. Its military may be able to destroy Hamas’s infrastructure, but its ideology is likely to resist. There are signs, for example, of growing support for the group in the occupied West Bank.
