T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Nothing will stop Israel from continuing the war against Hamas, including "international pressures", Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says, in a video posted to X . Speaking to soldiers at a military base in southern Israel, he says Israel will "continue to the end, until the victory, until the elimination of Hamas". Netanyahu adds: "I want to say in the clearest way what I just said to the commander in the field - we will continue to the end. "There is no such question at all. I say this also in the face of great pain [of the fallen soldiers], but also in the face of international pressures. "Nothing will stop us, we will go to the end, to victory, no less than that.
