A US official said Biden will likely bring up the need for better protections for aid workers and for an increase of food shipments into Gaza, Reuters news agency reports. The call comes after Biden said he was “outraged” by the strike and accused Israel of not doing enough to protect aid workers. Israel said it was a "grave mistake" and promised an investigation into the incident. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
