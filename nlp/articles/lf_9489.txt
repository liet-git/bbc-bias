Lets bring you some reaction now from other charities operating in Gaza. Natalia Anguera, head of operations in the Middle East for Action Against Hunger, says despite the killing of the seven World Central Kitchen aid workers, the charity will continue to work in Gaza. It  provides aid to more than 300,000 people, including fresh and dry food, nappies and water. “The conditions are more and more challenging," she says. "The lack of access – due to security situation often, but also the damage to infrastructure - and the shortage of will - is really hindering our capacity to deliver aid. " She adds that the majority of the staff are Palestinians, operating in a "very volatile" environment. "They are suffering themselves, but they also have a very strong and clear commitment to their humanitarian mandate. They want to go on delivering. " She says the international community should "strongly push for a permanent ceasefire". "That is the only way for everyone – national and expatriate staff - to do safe deliveries and scale up the humanitarian response, which is really what is needed. ”. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
