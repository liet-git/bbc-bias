T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. We’ve been hearing from some displaced Palestinians from northern Gaza, who have been telling the BBC World Service's Gaza Today about conditions where they are. There is huge shortage of basic commodities like soap, one of the men says, preventing people from being able to wash properly. “All people are suffering,” he says, because of “a shortage of water and soap in schools (where they are given shelter)”. He fears that the poor sanitation could lead to the spread of disease. “We pray to Allah the Almighty to protect people against viruses in order not to infect each other afterwards. ”. A young child says their shelter is “very dirty”. He hopes they can be provided with clean soap and detergents to clean their surroundings, and called on the “free Arab countries to help reach an immediate ceasefire. ”. A mother says that she and her daughter are suffering from scabies because of the poor hygiene in their shelter. She has sought medical help for her daughter, but her condition has deteriorated because of the “filth which surrounds the place”, says the mother. The daughter adds that she has “boils on my head and because of them, I cannot sleep at night. ”. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
