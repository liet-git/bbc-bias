At this time Bethlehem’s famous Christmas tree should be standing proud in Manger Square, welcoming tourists from all over the world. But because of the war it’s been cancelled this year, and the visitors who help to keep the West Bank city alive aren’t travelling here. This landmark square outside the Church of the Nativity - which marks the place where Christians believe Jesus was born - is now empty instead. Celebrations have been replaced by sadness as Palestinians mourn the thousands of people who’ve been killed in Gaza, and in the occupied West Bank, since 7 October. A small group of boys kick a football around the areas that would normally be filled with visiting festive crowds. The beautiful decorations and lights that would adorn the square aren’t here. Many of the souvenir shops, which rely on tourism, are also closed at what would usually be one of their busiest times. That’s making it a hard economic winter here too.
