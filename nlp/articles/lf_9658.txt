T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. As well as UN officials, we've been hearing reaction from humanitarian groups who've long called for a ceasefire in Gaza. Save the Children says the Security Council resolution will have given more than one million children trapped in Gaza "the hope of a brief respite today". "It needs to be implemented immediately and sustained definitively to protect children,‚Äù adds Xavier Joubert, the group's director in the occupied West Bank. Meanwhile, the International Rescue Committee says a ceasefire is the "only way to ensure civilians are protected and is central to enabling the scale up of humanitarian assistance to safely reach those in desperate need". It also urges Council members "to leverage all their influence to achieve an immediate cessation of hostilities and work towards a lasting ceasefire". T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
