It's now 22:25 BST in London and 00:25 in Israel, and with that, we're going to be pausing our live coverage on the Israeli air strike in Gaza that killed seven aid workers from the World Central Kitchen (WCK). There's been a lot of developments to keep track of over the last 24 hours. Israel is now under growing international pressure over the air strike, with senior Western officials and world leaders from the UK, Poland, Australia, Canada and the US, whose nationals died in the attack, all calling for a thorough investigation. Our colleagues over at BBC Verify have helpfully outlined everything that we can say for certain so far . It's also worth remembering before we go that WCK is now suspending operations in Gaza . This leaves vital humanitarian aid to the Strip in doubt, as the charity was one of the main aid providers. All while Gaza is on the brink of famine, according to a recent UN-backed report.
