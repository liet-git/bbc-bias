We are slowly piecing together what happened during the course of last night’s aid delivery. BBC Verify has previously located footage of chaotic aid deliveries to this stretch of Rashid Road in the last two months. In an incident we believe happened on 14 January, photographer Nooh al-Shaghnobi filmed civilians - who had been trying to secure aid from trucks - fleeing as gunfire is heard. The source of this gunfire is unclear. Their Instagram post claims that five people were killed during this incident – we cannot independently verify this. In their videos, we can see large crowds had formed around and on the trucks and a disorderly distribution of sacks of flour and other provisions by hundreds of Gazans. In a more recent incident on the morning of 19 February, we again see trucks overwhelmed by civilians securing what aid they can. Many stream past the camera carrying bags of flour. In another clip, we see a man scrabbling in the roadway to gather up spilt flour. In neither of these previous incidents do we see crushes or trampling occur. Gazans clamber on to a truck to secure aid during a delivery on 19 February. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
