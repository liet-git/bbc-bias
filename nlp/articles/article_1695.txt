A Peterborough councillor has resigned from the Conservatives over his party's stance on the conflict in Gaza. Mohammed Rangzeb, who represents Ravensthorpe on the city council, said he would now sit as an independent councillor. He has called for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas - something the Tories nationally have ruled out backing. The Conservatives national leadership has said they are steadfastly committed to Israel's right to defend itself. Mr Rangzeb said: "I decided to leave the party on Friday and sent my resignation. I can't support the party's national stand on the Gaza conflict.  "Too many innocent lives lost and yet the party won't call for a ceasefire. That's why I decided to leave the party.  "We are a nation that always stood up for human rights, but it's not the case this time. " The Conservative MP for Peterborough, Paul Bristow, was sacked from his junior government post in October after also calling for a permanent ceasefire. Responding to Mr Rangzeb's resignation, a spokesperson for the party said: "The Conservative Party is steadfastly committed to supporting Israel and its right to defend itself, whilst recognising this must be in line with international law.  "We have also called for humanitarian pauses to allow aid into Gaza.  "Cllr Rangzeb has indicated he does not agree with this position and therefore resigned. We wish him well for the future.
