Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir has been slightly injured and taken to hospital following a car accident, Israeli police say. Footage on social media showed a car that had flipped over. Two other people were also injured and the circumstances of the incident were under investigation, police said. Israeli media said Mr Ben-Gvir had been returning from the scene of a stabbing in the city of Ramle, near Tel Aviv. A 19-year-old woman was seriously injured in that incident, according emergency services. Central district police chief Avi Biton said a man who reportedly had mental health issues had attacked the woman and had then been shot and "neutralised" by a civilian. Mr Ben-Gvir is a controversial member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's emergency government. He recently called for a full-scale military response by Israel against Iran after Tehran's missile and drone attack on Israel, itself prompted by an Israeli attack which killed senior Iranian military figures in the Iranian consulate in Syria. Mr Ben-Gvir has also advocated the relocation of Palestinians from Gaza and supported calls for the re-establishment of Jewish settlements there. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
