In his statement on Wednesday evening, the Commons Speaker spoke of his deep concern about the security of MPs. Sir Lindsay Hoyle said that those concerns had played a part in his decision to break with precedent and to allow Labour to table a vote during an SNP debate. The speaker had heard from numerous Labour MPs who have faced criticism after they voted for their party's Gaza amendment in November, which stopped short of calling for an immediate ceasefire. Sir Lindsay wanted to give Labour MPs a chance on Wednesday to vote for their party's new amendment which called for an "immediate humanitarian ceasefire". Many Labour MPs wanted the chance to vote for that because they believed the SNP motion, which called for an immediate ceasefire, then went too far by accusing Israel of the collective punishment of people in Gaza. And they felt the government amendment, which called for humanitarian pauses, did not go far enough. BBC Newsnight has heard from Labour MPs who are worried about their security. Some have required police protection after they voted for the Labour amendment in November. Labour MPs have raised their concerns with the speaker and the police. Many believe the dangers they face are far graver than people realise.  T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
