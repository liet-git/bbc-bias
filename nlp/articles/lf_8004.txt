It wasn’t a surprise that this US draft resolution at the UN Security Council failed. The language is stronger than various iterations over the last few months which called for a pause in the fighting, or creating conditions for a sustainable cessation of hostilities or a temporary ceasefire as soon as practicable. Diplomacy can be complicated business. But Russia and China have made clear in past speeches before the council that it is past time for the international body to demand an immediate and unconditional ceasefire to end the suffering of Palestinian civilians. And the latest US draft did not explicitly do that. Rather, it tied one to the hostage deal currently being negotiated. Moscow’s ambassador accused the United States of trying to deliberately mislead the international community, while Washington’s ambassador accused Russia of playing politics. So where does this leave the international community? On Saturday, the security council will vote on another draft that does demand a ceasefire. And it’s unclear how the US will vote. Meanwhile, France is working on a longer term resolution focused on a political settlement to the crisis. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
