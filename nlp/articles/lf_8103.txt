 F-N-S-T-A-R-T. 8103 F-N-E-N-D.  D-A-T-E-S-T-A-R-T. 2024-02-22 D-A-T-E-E-N-D.  T-I-T-L-E-S-T-A-R-T. Tory minister refuses to back Hoyle as Speaker. T-I-T-L-E-E-N-D.  T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Maria Caulfield, the government's minister for women's health, has refused to back Hoyle as Speaker, saying she would "struggle to support" him for the way he handled yesterday's vote. Caulfield told Sky she thinks his position is now "difficult". Earlier she told the BBC her she felt the Speaker's decision yesterday to break with convention and allow the Labour amendment was the result of "undue pressure" from Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer. As a reminder, the original SNP motion called for an "immediate ceasefire" and said Israel's war amounted to "collective punishment" of Palestinians, a position Labour did not support. Meanwhile the government amendment called for a "humanitarian pause". Hoyle then allowed a Labour amendment calling for an "immediate humanitarian ceasefire". Caulfield said the Labour amendment meant "we would be the only party not supporting the SNP motion so all the fire would come on Conservative MPs". "I just felt that he was putting party politics above the impartiality of the Speaker, he took the threats to Labour MPs seriously but took no consideration of what would happen to Conservative MPs," Caulfield added. Earlier this month, a 46-year-old man admitted to calling the north London office of Conservative MP Mike Freer and saying: "I'm coming for you". The Tory MP has since said that he plans to stand down at the next election after earlier death threats and an arson attack on his constituency office. Conservative MP Maria Caulfield told the BBC that the Speaker had come 'under pressure' from Labour. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
