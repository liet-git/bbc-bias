SNP MP Dave Doogan says nearly a quarter of his case work since October has centred on the "humanitarian disaster" in Israel and Gaza, with the vast majority of his constituents calling for an end to the death, destruction and "unimaginable misery". He describes the Hamas fighters who carried out the 7 October attacks as "murderous criminals". Doogan says the conflict is a "disaster for everybody", for people in Gaza and Israel alike, adding that there are many people in Israel who are "desperately sad" about what is going on in Gaza.
