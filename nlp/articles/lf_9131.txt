T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. An pro-Iraqi Shia militia news channel on Telegram reports that the remnants of two Israeli missiles used in the attack on Iran have been found in neighbouring Iraq. Sabereen News said in a post that “remnants of a Zionist missile” were found in al-Aziziya, which is about 60km (45 miles) south-west of Baghdad. Photos showed what appeared to be the largely-intact remains of a dark grey projectile lying in a field, with fins at one end and a rounded tip filled with electronics at the other. Another post reported that the remains of a second missile were found in al-Latifiya, 25km south of the capital. The projectile appeared to be similar to the one found in al-Aziziya, but a number of men in uniform were seen inspecting it. Sabereen said they were members of the paramilitary Popular Mobilisation Force, which is dominated by Iran-backed militias. Sabereen, which is affiliated with the Iran-backed Asaib Ahl al-Haq militia, claimed the remnants demonstrated “its failure to reach the target rather than being intercepted or exposed to ground interference”. However, as we reported earlier, weapons experts have said they might be the single-stage boosters of Israeli-made, air-launched Rocks ballistic missiles, which could have been launched by an aircraft flying over Syria, further to the west. After separation from the boosters, the re-entry vehicles carrying live warheads could then have continued towards targets in Iran. Sabereen News posted photos showing the remains of what it said was an Israeli missile in central Iraq. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
