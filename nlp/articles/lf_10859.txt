As we've been reporting, Israeli forces are pushing into the centre of Khan Younis, the main city in the south of the Gaza Strip. Civilians in the city have been pictured collecting bodies and mourning their loved ones who've been killed in fighting. Meanwhile, some are fleeing the city to further south to take refuge in Rafah, on the Egyptian border. Razan Ashram holds the shoes of her late husband.
