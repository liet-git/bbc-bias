Last week, the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) published what it said showed access constraints on humanitarian aid in Gaza. The map included several marked “high risk areas” for aid convoys, one of which covered the coastal road south of the city of Deir al-Balah, where the aid workers were killed. The UN said the areas were “gathering points of people awaiting or taking relief supplies, where civilians and aid workers have been placed at risk”. The map described the al-Rashid coastal road as “a lengthy and overcrowded route” that was “designated for the passage of humanitarian aid by the Israeli authorities”. World Central Kitchen were part of the maritime corridor initiative, and used the passage to deliver humanitarian aid to Gazans.
