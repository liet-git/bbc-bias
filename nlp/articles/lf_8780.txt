T-I-T-L-E-E-N-D.  T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Some of the hundreds of thousands of civilians who were sheltering in Rafah are now fleeing the city as military operations intensify. Families were seen transporting their belongings in Rafah this morning as they looked for shelter away from the increased fighting. Rafah had been designated a safe zone by Israel for people displaced from their homes elsewhere in Gaza but many have now been ordered to leave or are fleeing. The Israeli military is pressing ahead with an incursion into the city, which it says is one of Hamas's last remaining strongholds in the Palestinian enclave. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
