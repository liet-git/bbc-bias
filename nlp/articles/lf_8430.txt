A group of families of hostages being held in Gaza have set up a camp site outside Israel's defence ministry in Tel Aviv. They have vowed to remain there until their loved ones are released and say they want to put pressure on the government. Yesterday, in our coverage of the crowds gathering in Hostages Square for a rally in Tel Aviv, we heard angry relatives pledge to protest at the defence HQ, and it seems they have followed through on their promise. Coupled with interventions from international figures, the families are hoping Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will be coerced into finding a way to secure the release of those held hostage. Netanyahu however has said that the only way to secure the release of hostages is with intense military pressure on Hamas. Sharon Kalderon, one of the protesters at the camp and the sister-in-law of one of the hostages, said: "We want our people back home, here, with us, and if we fight, we cannot bring them home alive. And we don't want to get bags. " Families are camping outside the Israeli HQ in Tel Aviv. Families have vowed to remain there until their loved ones are released. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
