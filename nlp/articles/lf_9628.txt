A joint naval mission from European Union member states has thwarted 11 attacks on civilian ships in the Red Sea since the end of February. "In less than two months since the operation was launched, the operation has escorted 68 vessels and has repelled 11 attacks," Josep Borrell, the EU's head of foreign policy, has said on Monday. Naval vessels participating in the mission are providing armed escorts to commercial ships navigating the Red Sea amid attacks by Yemen's Houthi militants. "Our ships have shot down nine unmanned aerial vehicles, one unmanned surface vessel, and four anti-ship ballistic missiles," says operation commander Rear Admiral Vasileios Gryparis. It comes as the cost of shipping a container from China to Europe doubled - with commercial ships travelling between Europe and Asia forced to take a longer route to avoid Houthi attacks, Borrell says. As a reminder, the Houthis - an Iranian-backed rebel group - responded to the war in the Gaza Strip by firing drones and missiles towards Israel, who they consider an enemy.
