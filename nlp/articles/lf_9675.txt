The US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, has set out why the US abstained on the UN Security Council's Gaza resolution. First, she refers to an earlier US resolution that was blocked by Russia and China as "they still can't bring themselves to condemn Hamasâ€™ terrorist attacks on October 7". "They have shown time and time again that they are not actually interested in advancing a durable peace through diplomatic efforts," she says. On today's resolution, Thomas-Greenfield believes "key edits" were ignored, particularly the condemnation of Hamas. "We did not agree with everything in the resolution," she says. "For that reason, we were unfortunately not able to vote yes. " She adds: "However, as I said before, we fully support some of the critical objectives in this nonbinding resolution. "And we believe it was important for the council to speak out and make clear that any ceasefire must come with the release of all hostages. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
