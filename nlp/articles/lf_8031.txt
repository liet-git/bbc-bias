Finland has become the latest country to say it will resume funding of the largest aid organisation in Gaza, the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA). In January, Israel accused 12 of UNWRA's staff of involvement in the Hamas attacks on 7 October . That led to several countries, including the US and the UK, suspending support. It follows the announcement by several states such as Australia, Canada and Sweden, that funding will resume. Finland's Foreign Trade and Development Minister Ville Tavio said in a statement: "Improvement of UNRWA's risk management, meaning preventing misconduct and initiating close monitoring, provides us with sufficient guarantees at this point for resuming the support. " UNRWA is investigating the information supplied by Israel regarding the allegations against its staff, with a final report expected in April. Damaged UNRWA school in the Gaza village of Khuzaa.
