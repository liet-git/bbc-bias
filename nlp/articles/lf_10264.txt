As we reported earlier, the health ministry in Gaza, which is run by Hamas, says the enclave was hit with more strikes this morning. In the southern city of Khan Younis, residents have been filmed digging through the rubble with their hands in a bid to find bodies and survivors buried underneath. Hassan Al-Byouk tells Reuters that the Israeli strike destroyed his house, and the buildings around it. "I think there were four people inside and there are people under the rubble who are not out yet," he says. "We can't get the dead out. We have to work with our hands. " He goes on: We are removing [rubble] with our hands but it is useless. . . we cannot do anything. Civil defence is not coming, fire engines are not coming. Everyone is scared and everyone is lost. " Hassan Al-Byouk tells Reuters that people are digging through rubble with their hands in Khan Younis, southern Gaza. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
