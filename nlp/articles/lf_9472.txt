There's been growing international pressure on Israel to conduct a swift and thorough investigation into the killing of seven aid workers in Gaza. Here's a reminder of some of those remarks: Speaking in Brussels earlier today, UK Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron said Britain "will be watching very closely" to make sure extra aid gets into the Strip and a "full, urgent and transparent inquiry" is carried out. On the sidelines at the same Nato foreign ministers conference, Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister Melanie Joly echoed Cameron's call for a full investigation and added that Israel needed to respect international law. Elsewhere, Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk said the deadly Israeli strike which killed a Polish citizen, and the Israeli government's reaction to the incident, were straining ties between the two countries. US President Joe Biden has said he was outraged and heartbroken, and criticised the Israeli military for not doing enough to protect civilians. Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong said Israel must answer how the aid vehicles, which according to media reports were clearly marked and their movement shared with the Israeli military, were attacked. As a reminder, Israeli military's chief of staff said the air strike was the result of a “grave mistake” following “a misidentification at night”. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
