Lawyers seeking to block British arms sales to Israel have formally urged the UK government to disclose its internal assessment of Israel’s compliance with international humanitarian law. In a letter to government lawyers, the Palestinian rights group, Al Haq, supported by the Global Legal Action Network, says ministers have a “duty of candour” to reveal the legal advice. The group are seeking judicial review of the government’s decision to continue selling arms to Israel and will make their case in a hearing at the High Court later this month. In their letter to the government’s legal department, seen by the BBC, they say ministers should disclose an internal assessment and legal advice that Alicia Kearns, who chairs the Foreign Affairs committee, says shows Israel is not demonstrating a commitment to international humanitarian law. The Foreign Office said the content of any such advice and assessment was confidential. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
