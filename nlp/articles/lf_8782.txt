The western part of Rafah city is currently under heavy bombardment and artillery fire, the most intense since the military operation began in early May. Eyewitnesses said that Israeli tanks have now taken control of the strategic Zoroub Hill, the highest hill overlooking the Palestinian-Egyptian border. The Israeli army has expanded its military operations in the west and troops are controlling 9km of the Philadelphi Corridor, witnesses told the BBC. Local officials said at least 16 people were killed overnight, with no confirmation from the health ministry yet. The air strikes have forced hundreds of families to flee to a nearby hospital, with rescue teams struggling to access the explosion sites. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
