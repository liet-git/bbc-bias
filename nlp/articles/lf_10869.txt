T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. UN chief Ant√≥nio Guterres says he regrets the UN Security Council's failure to demand a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip - saying the organisation has been "paralysed". Speaking at the Doha Forum in Qatar, Guterres says the body's "authority and credibility were severely undermined". But he added: "I can promise, I will not give up. " On Friday, the US vetoed the resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza - saying such a move would have been dangerous and unrealistic. The vote was brought about after Guterres deployed the rarely-used Article 99 of the UN charter to bring to the council's attention "any matter which in his opinion may threaten the maintenance of international peace and security". He had explained: "We are facing a severe risk of collapse of the humanitarian system. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
