It's just before 15:00 in Gaza and Israel (13:00 GMT) and here are some of the latest lines: Israeli forces carried out an intense bombardment in the southern Gazan city of Rafah overnight , which according to the Hamas-run health ministry killed at least 67 Palestinians. Across The Strip, the ministry says 164 people were killed in the last day - bringing the total number of people killed in Gaza to more than 28,100 . At least 67,500 others have been injured since Israel launched its retaliatory offensive in the strip, after the deadly 7 October Hamas attacks. Two Israeli hostages were rescued from the second floor of a building in Rafah . The Israeli military said Fernando Simon Marman, 60, and Louis Har, 70, are in "good medical condition". The pair were kidnapped from Nir Yitzhak kibbutz by Hamas on 7 October. Some 1.5 million people are sheltering in Rafah , after being displaced by Israeli operations elsewhere. Israel said it is planning an offensive in the city , which has been met by several warnings from the international community. Residents in Rafah are "terrified" of what's to come , the head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs told the BBC World Service. Meanwhile, an appeals court in the Netherlands ruled that the Dutch government must stop exporting F-35 jet parts to Israel - the judgement said it was "undeniable that there is a clear risk the exported F-35 parts are used in serious violations of international humanitarian law" T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
