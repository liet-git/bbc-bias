The US may be Israel’s closest ally, but this looks set to be a day of tough talks. For weeks, Washington has been calling on Israel to scale back its offensive against Hamas in Gaza, which has killed many thousands of civilians and caused widespread devastation and a deep humanitarian crisis. Although Israel’s military says it is shifting to more targeted warfare, dozens have been killed in its latest strikes on central and southern Gaza. In response to calls from hard-line ministers for Palestinians to move elsewhere, Blinken will say that displaced Gazans must be allowed to return home. However, reports say Israel may tie this to a new deal to release its hostages held by Hamas. Blinken will also press for a detailed post-war vision for Gaza and greater efforts to contain the war. Yesterday, in a further sign of the conflict spreading, Israel is said to have killed a top commander of the Lebanese armed group, Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. Blinken arrived in Israel last night.
