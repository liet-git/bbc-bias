US national security council spokesman John Kirby has said that Iran did not issue warnings to the White House about its timeframe for launching an attack on Israel. Briefing reporters in Washington, Kirby says the US did exchange messages with Iran, but insists there were no messages regarding Iran's timeframe or targets for the attack. Kirby says Iran's intent was to cause "significant destruction" and casualties. We've seen reporting that the Iranians meant to fail, and this spectacular and embarrassing failure was all by design. All of this is categorically false. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
