We’re about to pause our live coverage, but here's a recap of what happened on Monday. Hamas leaders said they had agreed to the terms of a ceasefire deal brokered by Egypt and Qatar. Israel rejected it as "far from meeting" its "core demands". It is sending a delegation for indirect talks in Cairo to secure an "acceptable" agreement. Among other developments today: Israel's army says it conducted "targeted strikes" against Hamas in eastern Rafah , after urging civilians to leave. Thousands did just that, moving to what the army calls an expanded "humanitarian area" to the north of Rafah. Israel says the operation is “limited”. In response, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad faction, which operates alongside Hamas, fired rockets at southern Israel. It is not clear what Hamas agreed to in a potential ceasefire deal negotiated by Egyptian and Qatari moderators, but terms are thought to include release of hostages and the return of displaced Palestinians within Gaza. Israeli negotiators will travel to Cairo for more talks on Tuesday. Protesters came out on the streets of Tel Aviv demanding a ceasefire agreement . A group representing families of Israeli hostages sent a message to government negotiators: “do not return without a signed deal”. John Kirby, the White House national security spokesman, said the talks between Israel and Hamas were at a "critical" stage : "I don't know that it gets any more sensitive than right now," he said.
