T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Israeli President Isaac Herzog has criticised Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir for saying "Hamas [loves] Biden", describing his comment as "irresponsible". Ben-Gvir posted the remark on X, formerly known as Twitter, after the US president warned he would cut off  weapons supplies to Israel if its troops enter the southern Gazan city of Rafah. Herzog says the comment could "damage Israel's national security interests", adding that "baseless, irresponsible, insulting statements" should be avoided. "Even when there are arguments and disappointing moments among friends and allies, there a way to sort out the differences," Herzog says. Herzog went on to thank Biden for being "a great friend of the state of Israel, and who has proved as much from the first day of the war". T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
