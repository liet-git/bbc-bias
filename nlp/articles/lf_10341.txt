As strikes continue in Rafah, Israeli forces have been telling Palestinians to evacuate the city. At a news briefing, IDF spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said Gazans had been urged to move towards an “expanded humanitarian area in Al-Mawasi and Khan Yunis” – about 10km to the north. He said: "Tonight, we also call upon those staying in specific areas which we have communicated and defined through every means - radio, media, internet, and flyers" in eastern Rafah to leave. Rafah is Hamas's last stronghold in Gaza, and packed with displaced civilians. The prospect of an Israeli invasion has caused an international outcry, with foreign leaders urging Netanyahu to not go ahead with the offensive. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees said the consequences would be devastating for more than a million people. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
