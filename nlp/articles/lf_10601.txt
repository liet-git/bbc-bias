In the middle of Saturday night, air raid alerts went off in Israel and residents were urged to seek shelter. Explosions were heard as air defences were activated. It's the first time that Iran has fired at Israeli territory. Interceptions lit up the night sky in several places across the country, while many of the strikes were shot down by Israel's allies before they reached Israeli territory. The Israeli military said the next day that Iran had launched more than 300 drones and missiles. At least nine countries were involved - with projectiles fired from Iran, Iraq, Syria and Yemen and downed by Israel, the US, the UK and France as well as Jordan.
