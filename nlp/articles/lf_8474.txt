The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) says it has responded to a number of attacks launched from Lebanon towards Israel in the last few hours. The IDF said that military buildings and "terrorist infrastructures" belonging to Hezbollah - the powerful Iranian-backed militia in Lebanon - had been struck by fighter jets in response to the hostilities. Hezbollah has repeatedly fired missiles and mortar shells across the border since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip on 7 October. The Israel-Gaza war has led to renewed hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah with an Israeli strike killing four people, including two journalists, in southern Lebanon last month. Israel said at the time it was responding to "a threat" in the area. Read more on Lebanon and Hezbollah's tense history with Israel. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
