T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. An Israeli official has been questioned by BBC News about the Israeli military directive to people in Khan Younis to leave the city centre - and about mounting civilian casualties. "Any civilian killed unnecessarily, that's a tragedy and shouldn't happen," says Mark Regev, a senior adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. "That's why we have urged civilians in central Khan Younis today: 'Please, there's going to be difficult fighting there. Please leave the area, move to safer zones, get out of harm's way. We don't want to see you caught up in crossfire between us and the Hamas gunmen. '" When asked about the situation in what Israel calls safe areas, Regev says his country has made a maximum effort to try to safeguard the civilian lives. Reminded that civilians have been hugely affected by the war, and asked when the conflict is expected to end, Regev says: "This could end tomorrow if we see more Hamas people surrendering, and if they release all the hostages. " Mark Regev insists Israel is minimising civilian casualties. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
