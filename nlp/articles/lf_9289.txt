T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. UN Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres has made an urgent appeal for a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza. He invoked Article 99 of the UN Charter, which allows him to bring to the attention of the Security Council "any matter which in his opinion may threaten the maintenance of international peace and security". "Facing a severe risk of collapse of the humanitarian system in Gaza, I urge the Council to help avert a humanitarian catastrophe & appeal for a humanitarian ceasefire to be declared," Guterres wrote in a post on X . He added this was the first time he had done so since he became secretary general in 2017. In a letter to the Security Council president, he stressed that the situation was deteriorating rapidly, with potentially irreversible implications for Palestinians and for security in the whole region.
