T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Away from Gaza, in the occupied West Bank, Israeli forces have shot and killed an unarmed teenage boy inside the Khalil Suleiman hospital compound in Jenin, according to the charity Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders). In an update on X (formerly Twitter) , MSF says earlier this morning Israeli troops also stopped ambulances taking discharged patients home outside the hospital in the north of the occupied West Bank. Paramedics and ambulance drivers were "ordered out of the ambulances, stripped and made to kneel in the street" while the patients were left inside the vehicles, it adds. MSF says all this took place "in full view of our team". Separately, the Palestinian Ministry of Health in the West Bank said in a post on Telegram that a 17-year-old boy was killed in Jenin after being shot in the chest by Israeli troops. It is not yet clear if this is the same incident. As we've been reporting, the Israeli military has been carrying out an operation in the city for three days - with 11 Palestinians reported killed up until this latest incident. Israel says it has confiscated dozens of weapons and taken out sites used to manufacture bombs. The BBC has asked the IDF about MSF's account of the shooting of the teenager. The ministry of health in the West Bank is operated by the Palestinian Authority, and is separate from the Gaza ministry of health, which is controlled by Hamas. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
