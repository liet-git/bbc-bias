The UNâ€™s humanitarian coordinator in Gaza says the UN will not participate in the evacuation of civilians from Rafah ahead of a possible Israeli ground attack there. Speaking to journalists in Geneva, Jamie McGoldrick said moving people to so-called "humanitarian islands" would amount to forced displacement. He added that so far the UN had been given no details by Israel about how exactly the estimated 1.5 million people currently sheltering in Rafah would be moved. Would they be "pushed, forced, or encouraged?" McGoldrick asked. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
