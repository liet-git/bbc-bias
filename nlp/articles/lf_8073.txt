The SNP's David Linden also spoke before his party's Westminster leader, Stephen Flynn. He challenged Penny Mordaunt on why house speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle didn't opt for the Liberal Democrat amendment if he in fact wanted to give "the widest possible debate". He added to this by saying the SNP were "stitched up" in a deal with Labour. Mordaunt replied by directing MPs to internal advice and asserted that anyone "peddling the line" that yesterday's events would have lead to a larger debate has not read the advice. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
