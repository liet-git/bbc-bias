BBC Arabic has been hearing from Abo Mohamed Attya, who was in Rafah when the overnight Israeli military operation happened. He said: "We were sleeping and suddenly awoken by the sound of bombardment. . . thanks to God for the protection but others were in pieces". He had previously been living at the al-Nuseirat refugee camp further north in the Gaza Strip before being displaced. He said he would have been prepared to leave Rafah if prior warning had been given. "We would have gone out of Rafah to anywhere they told us. We have no problem, we would evacuate for our children. There is no safe place any more; nowhere is safe, even the hospitals are unsafe. " Palestinians inspect damage after an Israeli attack. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
