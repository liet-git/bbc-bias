Our coverage this morning has been following reports of heavy shelling in Rafah, after Joe Biden warned Israel against a major ground offensive there. As a reminder, here's a brief look at how the conflict has developed in recent months up until this point: On 7 October, Hamas launched an attack on Israel , killing about 1,200 people and taking more than 250 others to Gaza as hostages. Israel retaliated with a campaign of air strikes on targets in Gaza, and then launched a ground invasion three weeks later. Israel's attacks were initially focused on northern Gaza, particularly Gaza City and tunnels beneath it. A deal agreed in November saw Hamas release 105 hostages in return for a week-long ceasefire and some 240 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Israel says 128 hostages are unaccounted for. Following a temporary truce in late November, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) extended ground operations to southern Gaza. More than 34,000 Palestinians have been killed, and tens of thousands injured by Israeli strikes since the start of the war, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. On Monday, the Israeli military ordered tens of thousands of civilians to begin evacuating nearby eastern parts of Rafah city , ahead of what it called a "limited" operation to eliminate Hamas fighters. Hamas said Israel's seizure of the Rafah crossing was aimed at undermining attempts by regional mediators to secure a new ceasefire deal. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Hamas's announcement was "very far from Israel's necessary requirements" T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
