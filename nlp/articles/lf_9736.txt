More now from the briefing the IDF gave last night on its inquiry into Monday's strike. It says its drone operators mistook an aid worker carrying a bag for a gunman, and then targeted one of the WCK vehicles with a missile. It says two people escaped that vehicle and got into a second car, which was hit by another missile from a drone. The Israeli military says there were survivors from the second explosion, who managed to get into the third vehicle which was then also hit by a missile.  By the end all the aid workers were dead. The initial inquiry, carried out by a retired Major General, Yoav Har-Even, found that the army unit involved had believed the vehicles they were tracking from the sky had been taken over by Hamas gunmen and that they were not aware of the co-ordination procedures put in place between the military and WCK for that evening. It also says the unit did not know the cars belonged to the charity, and the three air strikes had been in violation of the armyâ€™s own procedures. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
