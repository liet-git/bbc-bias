We've been hearing from people sheltering at the European Hospital in Khan Younis. BBC Arabic's Gaza Today programme spoke to a woman, who described how people in Rafah found themselves surrounded by "fire belts" as they fled: Before our displacement from Rafah, they fired missiles at us before dropping the flyers. After dropping the flyers, we found ourselves besieged by successive fire belts. We ran out of our houses and could not even take our clothes with us. Shrapnel and shards were scattered over the entire house, so we were unable to take anything with us. We had to leave in a very tragic and difficult way, and my children were trembling with fear.
