World Central Kitchen founder José Andrés has accused Israeli forces in Gaza of targeting the aid workers in a strike that killed seven members of his staff on Monday, "systematically, car by car". Speaking to Reuters news agency, Andrés says that the killing of seven WCK personnel was not a mistake or a misfire, and asserts that the Israelis knew their movements at the time of the attack. "Even if we were not in coordination with the (Israeli army), no democratic country and no military can be targeting civilians and humanitarians," he says. Israel's military has expressed its "severe sorrow" over the incident, while Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the strike was unintentional. World Central Kitchen founder Jose Andres.
