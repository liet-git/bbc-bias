Israel’s military is reported to have increased the number of its air defence batteries near the Lebanese border. Its spokesman didn’t comment directly on the killing of the Hamas official but said that Israeli forces were in “a very high state of readiness” for any response. In the occupied West Bank, Palestinian factions have condemned the assassination, and protests have been taking place. Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of the Lebanese armed group, Hezbollah, is due to make a speech later. He’s previously vowed a “severe reaction” to any Israeli killing on Lebanese soil. Israeli media portray Saleh al-Arouri as having been near the top of an Israeli hit list. But some analysts point out the negative impact that his killing is likely to have on efforts to free more than 100 Israeli hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
