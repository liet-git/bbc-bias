As weâ€™ve been reporting, 253 people were taken hostage by Hamas on 7 October. Of these, 109 have been released as part of prisoner exchanges or in separate deals and three have been rescued by the Israeli army. About 130 remain unaccounted for, at least 34 of whom are presumed dead. The bodies of 12 hostages have been recovered, including three that the IDF admitted to accidentally killing in one of their operations. The most recent of these was recovered yesterday, when the Israeli army announced it had returned the body of Elad Katzir from the Khan Younis area of southern Gaza. Hamas says the number of dead hostages is higher than this as a result of IDF air strikes, but it is not possible to verify these allegations. The two youngest hostages taken in the Hamas attacks were Ariel and Kfir, who were 4 years and 9 months old respectively at the time of their abduction. Their deaths have been reported, but not confirmed. The BBC has put together stories of those hostages who are still being held, which have either been confirmed by the BBC or credibly reported. Doron Steinbrecher has been held hostage by Hamas. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
