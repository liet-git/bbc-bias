T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. This is largely a process today involving cabinets signing off recognition after the respective prime ministers announced they would do it last week on 28 May. Spanish PM Pedro Sánchez, is making a statement now at La Moncloa, the government's headquarters, saying it’s “for peace, for justice and for coherence” ahead of Spanish cabinet approval. Dublin too is formally approving the plan brought by Tánaiste (Foreign Minister) Micheál Martin to the cabinet – and the Palestinian flag will be raised alongside the Ukrainian flag at Leinster House, the seat of parliament. It’s a big deal for Spain and Ireland but other EU states think it’s not the right time at all, including Belgium, Malta and Slovenia which were initially cited as keen. Several EU states already recognise a Palestinian state because they did already before the joined the EU. Sweden is the only Western European state that has done so up until now - in 2014. Spain has the most rhetoric – it has EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell who yesterday targeted Netanyahu accusing him of using the term antisemitism whenever anyone criticised him – EU foreign ministers yesterday agreed to hold a meeting of the EU-Israel Council in response to the ICJ announcement. Borrell is the most outspoken man in the EU on Israel. Spanish Foreign Minister José  Manuel Albares also spoke outside yesterday’s EU FMs meeting in Brussels. "Recognising the state of Palestine is about justice for the Palestinian people," it’s also "the best guarantee of security for Israel and absolutely essential for reaching peace in the region", he said alongside his Irish and Norwegian counterparts.
