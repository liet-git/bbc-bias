The authorities in Atlanta have released statements with new details about the confrontation between police and protesters at Emory University. Atlanta police say a protest group including both students and non-students was ordered to disperse but refused. Chemical sprays were used, police say, but they deny earlier suggestions that rubber bullets were fired. The university also released a statement, saying that the initial wave of activists were not associated with the school, although “members of the Emory community later joined the initial group”. The protesters, officials say, “were disrupting the university as our students finish classes and prepare for finals”. Videos on social media showed a university professor among those being led away by police. Emory said a “couple of dozen” people were taken into custody but declined to say exactly how many, or if any of the protesters have been charged. Atlanta police at the Emory protests earlier today.
