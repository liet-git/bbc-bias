Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is also in the news this morning. He says the UK continues to stand by Israel's right to defend its security six months on from the start of the Israel-Gaza war. But, the prime minister has said the nation remains "appalled" by the deaths of three British aid workers in an Israeli Defense Forces(IDF) strike this week. He has repeated calls for a "humanitarian pause" to allow more aid into Gaza. Separately, the UK has announced a Royal Navy ship is to be deployed to the region to help deliver aid. The Foreign Office has pledged Â£9.7m for aid, equipment and expertise to help an international effort to establish a maritime aid corridor between Cyprus and Gaza. Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron has warned that the UK's backing of Israel's right to self defence is "not unconditional". He wrote in the Sunday Times that "we expect such a proud and successful democracy to abide by international humanitarian law, even when challenged in this way".
