Let’s take a look at the latest developments from Gaza over the last week. On Monday 1 April, seven people working for the food aid charity World Central Kitchen (WCK) were killed in an Israeli strike in Gaza . Israel has admitted its forces made a “grave mistake” and on Friday, following an inquiry into the incident, announced the sacking of two senior officers involved in the decision-making that led to the strike. The inquiry found that the Israel Defense Forces unit involved believed the three WCK vehicles eventually targeted with missiles had been taken over by Hamas gunmen. WCK has called for an independent commission to investigate the killings, saying Israel's apologies "represent cold comfort" for the victims' families. Since the strike on Monday, WCK and some other aid agencies have paused their operations in Gaza, where the UN estimates 1.1 million people - half the population - are facing catastrophic hunger. It comes after Israel said it had approved the opening the Erez crossing and Ashdod Port for humanitarian deliveries . It has not yet detailed how these routes will operate. In their first call since the strike, US President Joe Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that US support for Israel would depend on steps being taken to "address civilian harm" in Gaza. And yesterday the Israeli army announced that the body of a hostage, 47-year-old Elad Katzir, had been recovered from Gaza and returned to Israel . Seven people were killed in an Israeli strike on an aid convoy in Gaza earlier this week. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
