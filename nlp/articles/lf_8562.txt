T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Following Unrwa's claim that three aid convoys have been hit in recent months, we've been hearing from Unicef spokesperson, Tess Ingram , who is currently in Gaza. Ingram tells BBC 5 Live Breakfast that Gaza is "one of the most dangerous places" for humanitarian workers to be at the moment. Asked about the seven aid workers who were killed in an Israeli strike, she says it feels "frustrating". â€œThis is not the first time that has happened", Ingram adds. "We have lost nearly 200 humanitarian aid workers since the escalation of hostilities. Other vehicles and warehouses have been hit, The system that is supposed to protect us is clearly not functioning properly. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
