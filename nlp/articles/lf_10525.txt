It has taken more than seven months and a soaring death toll in Gaza to reach this point. But now, in an interview with CNN, US President Joe Biden has explained why he has paused the delivery of some of Americaâ€™s most powerful weapons to Israel, notably the 2000lb (960 kg) and 500lb (227 kg) bombs. So what exactly is the effect of a 2000lb bomb dropped from the air? As a weapon of war, the 2000lb so-called Joint Direct Attack Munitions bomb has a massive destructive power. According to the UN, it has a lethal fragmentation radius of 350 metres, it can penetrate concrete more than three metres thick and leaves a crater over 15 metres wide, making it completely unsuitable for use in a place heavily populated with civilians, like Rafah. Even for those people several streets away, the effects can be horrific. The UN states that "the pressure from the explosion can rupture lungs, burst sinus cavities and tear off limbs hundreds of metres from the blast site". It is clear that despite whatever assurances have been given by Israel to its US ally, Washington does not want to find itself complicit in the use by the Israeli Air Force of these weapons in the southern Gazan city of Rafah, where an estimated 1.4m Palestinians are crowded into a small area.
