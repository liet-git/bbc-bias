We've been hearing from Sean Casey, an emergency medical teams co-ordinator with the World Health Organization (WHO), who was part of a UN mission to hospitals in the north of Gaza yesterday. He says the mission found no functioning hospitals or operating theatres there. "[There is] no place for any woman who needs to deliver by caesarean section, no place for post-operative care," he told BBC Radio 4's The World at One programme. "As a consequence, we're seeing an enormous amount of suffering. " Casey says he saw patients "essentially waiting to die, unless there's some way to get them out, which is extremely challenging".
