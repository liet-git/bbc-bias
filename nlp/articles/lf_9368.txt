Rewaa Mohsen, a nurse, has just made contact from Deir al Balah through WhatsApp. The mother-of-two gave birth to her youngest daughter just two days before the war began. She says it's been “very hard” to keep her daughters calm and entertained. “She has her cousins to play with. Also have toys,” she says over WhatsApp, referring to her two-year-old. “We try to keep her busy so she don’t hear bombs. ”. Rewaa says her day so far has consisted of doing house work - cleaning and washing the dishes - while feeding her youngest daughter. Rewaa sends a picture of bags piled at the side of her home, intended to be grabbed at a moment's notice in case the family needs to flee.
