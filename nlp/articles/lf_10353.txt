T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. A senior Palestinian official, familiar with the ceasefire agreement, says Hamas has agreed to end “hostile activity forever” if the conditions of the truce are met. The phrase hints that Hamas may be contemplating the end of its armed struggle, although no further details have been provided, and would come at the conclusion of a two-phase ceasefire deal. Each phase would last 42 days, and the second stage would conclude with a “sustainable long period of calm” and the complete lifting of the blockade of Gaza. The first stage will include the remaining Israeli female soldiers currently held hostage, who will be released in exchange for 50 Palestinian prisoners each, including some who are serving life sentences. During this period, Israeli troops will remain within Gaza - but within 11 days of the ceasefire coming into force, Israel will begin dismantling its military facilities in the centre of the Gaza Strip and will withdraw from Salahuddin Road and Coastal Road. After 11 days, Palestinians will be allowed to return to the north of the Gaza strip. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
