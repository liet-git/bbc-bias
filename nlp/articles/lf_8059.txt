T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Tory MP Danny Kruger says he signed the no-confidence motion in the Speaker for "allowing" Labour to use extremist threats to MPs' safety to "change the way our democracy works". "This is unacceptable," he writes on X . The MP for Devizes says his decision is "not personal" and, like Ben Wallace , indicates that Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer was "even more culpable". "He should be standing for democracy and against mob rule. Instead he used the threat of violence for party political ends, to wriggle out of a crisis created by Labour's unbridgeable division over Israel," he adds. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
