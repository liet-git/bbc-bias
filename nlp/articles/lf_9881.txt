T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Israeli snipers killed seven people, and injured 14, inside Nasser Medical Complex in the city of Khan Younis, a spokesperson for the Hamas-run health ministry has claimed. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) have not responded to the accusations, made by the ministry's Dr. Ashraf Al-Qudra on Telegram. Videos on social media also purport to show victims of the alleged sniper attacks entering the hospital, as well as shots being fired at doctors and paramedics trying to reach injured people outside the complex. Aid agency Doctors without Borders (MSF) tweeted about a similar incident on Saturday. A post on X , formerly Twitter, stated MSF staff reported shots had been fired at people inside the hospital. The post said two people had been killed and five injured, including a nurse. “Israeli forces are continuing operations in the immediate vicinity of Nasser hospital. Heavy fighting is trapping people inside the building and preventing anyone from entering to access care,” MSF wrote. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
