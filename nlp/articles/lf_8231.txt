Labour's Chris Elmore , MP for Ogmore, pushes Sunak on his government's "grubby deal" with Tata Steel, which has put thousands of jobs in the steel industry at risk in Port Talbot and beyond. Elmore accuses Sunak of failing to protect the steel industry, and says he has two options, firstly to "work with the unions, Tata and workforce to protect industry and protect jobs with investment". The second option is to "walk away, as Tory leaders always do, and abandon South Wales once again", he says. Sunak says the government has worked hard to secure a "sustainable future" for Welsh steel. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
