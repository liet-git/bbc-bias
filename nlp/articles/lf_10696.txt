The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Philippe Lazzarini, has said civilians in the Gaza Strip are enduring "hell on earth", after visiting the enclave. The UN says aid distribution in much of the territory has largely stopped due to the intensity of fighting and restrictions on movement along main roads. Posting on X, Lazzarini says: "Back in Gaza, endless deepening tragedy. "People are everywhere, live in the street, need everything. "They plead for safety and for an end to this hell on earth. " He says his agency is facing "an impossible situation". On Saturday, a senior UN aid official warned that half of Gaza's population was starving and only a fraction of the supplies needed have been able to enter the Strip. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
