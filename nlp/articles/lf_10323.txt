T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. The Israeli military has said they have taken operational control of the Palestinian side of the Rafah crossing which is on the border with Egypt. We have witnesses in Rafah saying that there were flares lighting up the sky overnight. There was the constant sound of Israeli bombardments and the Israeli army says it has killed 20 - what it calls  Hamas "terrorists" - and says it has found three tunnel shafts in that area around the crossing. It is stressing at the moment that it is still a very limited and precise operation, that it’s not the full-scale ground offensive of Rafah which the world powers have been warning against because of the dire humanitarian consequences in the city that is so packed with Palestinians who fled the fighting elsewhere in Gaza. All this going on adds to the diplomatic pressure. The Qataris have been mediators in the potential hostage deal, sending their team back to Cairo so they can talk again about a ceasefire. It is very confusing because we had an Israeli official saying last night, quoted anonymously, this seems to be an Egyptian proposal that Hamas had accepted, it wasn’t meeting the Israeli requirements. But then there were other officials coming out and saying, well this is actually very close to an Israeli proposal that was put forward at the end of last month, which the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken then described as being extraordinarily generous.
