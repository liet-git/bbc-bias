The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Mirjana Spoljaric, has arrived in Israel, where she will meet government officials, speak to the families of hostages and visit the occupied West Bank. The ICRC has been criticised by some groups in Israel for what they describe as the organisationâ€™s failure to visit hostages. The ICRC has repeatedly called for access to them, but says it cannot do so without agreement from both warring parties. In an earlier statement the Red Cross said it did not know where the hostages were, and could not "force its way in" to Gaza to gain access to them. Spoljaric is likely to use her meeting with the Israeli government to call for better humanitarian access to Gaza, where aid agencies warn that inadequate supplies and restricted access because of the fighting mean they can longer provide any meaningful assistance. Israelis continue to call for the release of the remaining hostages - on Tuesday this woman was pictured raising her hands with the words "no time" written on them at a rally. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
