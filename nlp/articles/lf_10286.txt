T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. As we've been reporting, Israeli negotiators have arrived in Cairo for talks on a truce in Gaza and hostage release. AFP news agency reports that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has instructed the Israeli delegation to "stand firm on the conditions necessary for the release" of Israeli hostages held in Gaza since 7 October, and on "essential requirements for guaranteeing Israel's security". This comes after Hamas said yesterday it had accepted a ceasefire plan proposed by mediators Egypt and Qatar. Israeli officials said that plan fell short of Israel's essential demands. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
