We reported earlier that Israel was sending a delegation to Egypt to discuss a ceasefire agreement, after Benjamin Netanyahu said what had been agreed already fell short of expectations. The Hostages Families Forum Headquarters group has said that the delegation must not return without a signed agreement. In a short statement, the group said that it welcomed "the Prime Minister and the War Cabinet on their swift deliberation and decision to send a negotiation delegation". It said it hoped that delegation would "exhaust Hamas's position and turn it into a deal for the return of all the hostages". "Now is the time to demand from the negotiation team and all international partners - do not return without a signed deal," the group says. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
