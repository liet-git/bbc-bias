Israel's offensive on Rafah, which international leaders warned Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu against, is going to cause "a lot of casualties", the EU's foreign policy chief says. "The Rafah offensive has started again in spite all the requests of the international community, the US, the European Union member states, everybody asking Netanyahu not to attack", Josep Borrell tells reporters. "I am afraid that this is going to cause again a lot of casualties, civilian casualties. Whatever they say. " Borrell adds that there are "no safe zones in Gaza". A continuous Israeli bombardment on Rafah has taken place overnight, hours after Israel rejected Hamas's agreement to a ceasefire deal. Earlier, the IDF said its troops were engaged in a "very targeted operation and a very limited scope against very specific targets" in eastern Rafah. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
