For much of Monday, Israel’s war cabinet were in discussions over its response to Iran’s attack over the weekend. How Israel will respond remains unclear. Addressing reporters on Monday, Daniel Hagari, spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), said Tel Aviv must do everything necessary to protect the state "at the time and in the way we in Israel choose to do so". He said the Iranian attack was "thwarted with the iron defence campaign," adding that it counted on an "unprecedented coalition" from the UK, US, France and other countries, which "not only thwarted but truly prevented that attack". Army chief Herzi Halevi told reporters Iran's attacks over the weekend "will be met with a response". While Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said the international community "must continue to stand united in resisting this Iranian aggression, which threatens world peace".
