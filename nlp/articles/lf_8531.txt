T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. In London, Sadiq Khan has added his voice to calls for the UK government to suspend weapons sales to Israel after an air strike in Gaza killed seven aid workers. During an interview with PoliticsJOE earlier, the city's mayor said the government "should be pausing all sales of weapons" to Israel and asked: "[Prime Minister Rishi Sunak] claims to be chums . . . with Benjamin Netanyahu. Where is the evidence we're using that influence to put pressure on the Israeli government?" Other senior British politicians have urged similar: Scottish First Minister Humza Yousaf repeated his belief that the UK is "complicit" in the killing of civilians if arms sales continue. David Lammy , shadow foreign secretary, called for the government to release its legal advice about whether Israel has broken international law, while Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey said â€œthe government must take swift action to suspend arms exports to Israel" Tory peer Nicholas Soames agreed it was "probably time" for the UK to suspend arms sales. And more than 600 legal experts, including three former Supreme Court justices, signed an open letter calling for the export of weapons to stop. Sunak said earlier this week that the UK has a "very careful" arms licensing regime. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
