The brother of a hostage taken by Hamas during their 7 October attacks on Israel has said that the families of hostages have been "begging" the Israeli government to meet with them but that there has been no response. Danny Elghart, whose brother Yitzhak was kidnapped from Kibbutz Nor Oz, said that the families are waiting for the government to offer, "some kind of outline, some kind of deal," for the recovery of hostages from Gaza. "I don't understand what they are waiting for," he added, "Now all we're receiving is one coffin after another. " Elghart said that if there was no response from Israel's cabinet or prime minister, the next step for the families of the hostages would be to move their protests to the Kirya in Tel Aviv which is home to the Israeli Defence Forces headquarters. "We are going to be waiting for them everywhere and anywhere. . . a deal has to be on the table. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
