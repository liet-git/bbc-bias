T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. The Dutch government is not obliged to stop the supply of F-35 fighter jet parts from a US-operated warehouse in the Netherlands. The district court in The Hague has published a judgement in response to a legal challenge brought by a number of NGOs - Oxfam Novib, peace movement PAX Netherlands and The Rights Forum. The NGOs argued the Netherlands is violating international law by supplying Israel with parts intended for combat equipment, while according to the groups the Dutch government knows that Israel is thus violating fundamental principles of the law of war. Dutch ministers said they'd weighed up the situation on the ground along with Israelâ€™s right to self defence. The judge came to the conclusion that government had made reasonable decisions to allow the supply the parts to continue. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
