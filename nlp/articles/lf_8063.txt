As we head into the afternoon, let's take a look back at what's been happening today since last night's break of parliamentary convention and subsequent walkout of the House of Commons: Right now, 60 MPs say they have no confidence in Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle . The number has been steadily rising over the morning, so more could add their voice to the call this afternoon. Hoyle briefly appeared during the Business Questions session in the House of Commons this morning and apologised again. He is holding talks with party leaders , and is facing calls for his resignation. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has not revealed whether Hoyle still has his confidence. The SNP leader Stephen Flynn says Hoyle has lost the party's confidence. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer "categorically" denied allegations he threatened Hoyle into allowing the Labour amendment. Some MPs are voicing fears for their safety following last night's vote, which approved a Labour Party call for an "immediate humanitarian ceasefire" During Business Questions, a number of Tory, Labour and SNP MPs called for a new debate on Israel-Gaza. A rally in favour of a ceasefire was held outside Westminster during the chaos of yesterday evening. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
