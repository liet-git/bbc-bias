In the US, congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez - more commonly known as AOC - has just been speaking at a rally in Washington calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. She urges leaders to "stand for" peace and a ceasefire between the Israeli military and Hamas. In a brief speech, AOC says the credibility of the US "is on the line" - as is the "credibility of our commitment to human rights," adding: Because the moment we show that it's conditional - that our commitment to human rights is conditional - for Palestinians, we're sending a message that it's conditional for everyone. We cannot allow ourselves to set that precedent . . . there is a human cost that is too high and we have reached it. That's why we must join together and call for a ceasefire now. " Her words come on the same day White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan arrived in Israel for talks with Israeli ministers, including PM Benjamin Netanyahu. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
