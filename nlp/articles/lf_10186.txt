While US officials were visiting the West Bank today, people took to the streets of Ramallah and Hebron in solidarity with civilians in Gaza. Protesters were pictured carrying Hamas flags, and chanted slogans in support of the people of Gaza. Some people held up pictures of Houthi leader Abdul Malik al-Houthi during the protest. The Houthis, who rule large parts of Yemen, have been attacking ships that they claim are going to Israel or are owned by Israeli companies since the start of the war in Gaza. The Iranian-backed group says that they will continue with their attacks until Israel stops its offensive in the Gaza Strip.
