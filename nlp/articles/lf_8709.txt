More now on reports that three sons and at least two grandchildren of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh have been killed in an air strike. Haniyeh told Al Jazeera that the deaths will not affect the group's demands in ceasefire talks with Israel, which have failed to yield an agreement despite growing international pressure. "Our demands are clear and specific and we will not make concessions on them. The enemy will be delusional if it thinks that targeting my sons, at the climax of the negotiations and before the movement sends its response, will push Hamas to change its position," Haniyeh told Al Jazeera. "The blood of my sons is not dearer than the blood of our people," he added. Hamas has, in public at least, stuck with its initial demands of a permanent ceasefire, the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops and the return of displaced Palestinians to northern parts of the territory without restrictions. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meanwhile insists that Israel will continue fighting until Hamas is destroyed and hostages are free.
