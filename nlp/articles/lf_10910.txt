Cindy McCain, head of the World Food Programme (WFP), has reiterated a warning that famine is "imminent" in the north of Gaza. "If we wait much longer, we're going to go over the edge and not be able to recover from it," she tells the BBC. She hopes that with the opening of the Ashdod Port and Erez Gate in northern Gaza , food will get in at scale but adds that it can't stop there. "Children are dying, as we speak, they are dying of hunger, that's why it's important we feed those who are desperately hungry. " She says the WFP will not halt its operations in Gaza but says "this is dangerous work". Food charity World Central Kitchen paused its operations in Gaza earlier this week after seven of its aid workers were killed in an Israeli air strike. "It was unconscionable that WCK was hit, it's a terrible situation; there's been more aid workers than those who have been killed and we're sorry for all of them.
