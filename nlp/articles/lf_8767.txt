Spain and Norway now both recognise a Palestinian state. Norway has hailed its recognition of a Palestinian state as a "special day", with foreign minister Espen Barth Eide saying his country "has been one of the most fervent defenders of a Palestinian state for more than 30 years. " "The day that Norway officially recognises Palestine as a state is a special day for Norway-Palestine relations," Eide added, saying it was "regrettable that the Israeli government shows no sign of constructive commitment" to a two-state solution. Spain also formally recognised a Palestinian state in a decision approved by its cabinet earlier today, a government spokeswoman said. Pilar Alegria added the cabinet had "adopted an important decision to recognise a Palestinian state", which had "one objective: to help Israelis and Palestinians achieve peace". Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said before meeting his cabinet that the "recognition of the State of Palestine is not only a matter of historic justice. . . Is it also an essential requirement if we are all to achieve peace. " The move, he said, was "not against anyone, least of all Israel". Spain's foreign ministry has also said Madrid, Dublin and Oslo would issue a "firm" response to Israeli rebukes. A pro-Palestinian tent encampment at the University of Oslo. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
