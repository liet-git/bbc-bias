Israel’s attack on the World Central Kitchen convoy in Gaza that killed seven aid workers has raised fresh questions about the way the country is carrying out its war against Hamas in Gaza, where the Hamas-run health ministry says more than 32,000 Palestinians have been killed, entire neighbourhoods have been flattened and a humanitarian crisis only gets worse. In a video message late on Tuesday, IDF Chief of Staff Lt Gen Herzi Halevi said the initial findings of an investigation concluded the attack was a “mistake” that followed a “misidentification, at night, during a war, in very complex conditions”. “It shouldn’t have happened,” he said. We still do not have details about the alleged misidentification or how the strike was approved to go ahead, as it hit a convoy that was clearly marked with the World Central Kitchen logo. The three cars were hit separately, and the organisation said the group’s movements had been co-ordinated with the Israeli military, precisely to prevent something like what happened. Three of those killed were British nationals, one was a dual US-Canadian citizen while the others had come from Australia, Poland and Gaza. Those countries have reacted angrily, demanding explanations and accountability. Israel was already facing intensifying international pressure amid the immense suffering in Gaza, as the army’s actions come under scrutiny. Charities and some of the country’s allies have accused Israel of not doing enough to protect civilians and of intentionally slowing down the entry and delivery of humanitarian assistance, weaponising aid – claims the Israeli government rejects.
