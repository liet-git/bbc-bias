T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. According to one UN Security Council diplomat, a motion calling for some form of ceasefire or suspension of hostilities in Gaza is heading towards another veto from the US. Our correspondent Nada Tawfik reports that negotiations went on until 00:30 in New York. “We’re headed to a veto unless there’s a miracle," the diplomat said. The diplomat said the White House just couldn’t accept the UN monitoring mechanism for aid, despite not having previously declared that a redline. If the US does veto this resolution, it would be their third veto to block Security Council action over the Israel-Hamas war. Efforts at the UN are continuing after Tuesday's vote was delayed with negotiators trying to agree wording that will not be vetoed by Washington. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
