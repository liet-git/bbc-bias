The ICC, based in The Hague in the Netherlands, has been investigating Israel's actions in the occupied West Bank and Gaza for the past three years - and also the actions of Hamas since the 7 October. Israel is not a member of the court and does not recognise its jurisdiction, but the Palestinian territories were admitted as a member state in 2015. ICC judges will now determine whether they believe the evidence is sufficient to issue arrest warrants. The timeframe can vary, with weeks and even months sometimes elapsing between the point at which the ICC prosecutor requests an arrest warrant, and judges ruling on it. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
