More than three-quarters of the 193-member General Assembly backed the move to demand a ceasefire. The resolution - which is not binding but does carry political weight and reflects the global view of the war - was favoured by 153 members. The US, Paraguay , Austria and Israel were among 10 members to vote against it. Speaking ahead of the vote, US ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield told the assembly: "Any ceasefire right now would be temporary at the best and dangerous at worst - dangerous to Israelis, who would be subject to relentless attacks, and also dangerous to Palestinians, who deserve the chance to build a better future for themselves, free from Hamas. " The UK , Germany , Italy , Netherlands and Ukraine were among the 23 countries to abstain. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
