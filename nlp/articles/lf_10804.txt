T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Benny Gantz, a member of the Israeli war cabinet, has spoken to the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken tonight about the "heightened aggression and increased attacks by Iranian-backed Hezbolllah" on Israel. He said Israel must remove the threat from the civilian population of northern Israel. He called on the international community to act to ensure that â€œthe State of Lebanon stops such aggression adjacent to the border", Gantz wrote on X , formerly Twitter. Since the Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October and Israel began retaliatory strikes on Gaza, Hezbollah has frequently targeted Israel from across the border in Lebanon. Hezbollah is politically influential and in control of the most powerful armed force in Lebanon, and is a staunch supporter of Hamas. Gantz also thanked Blinken for the US veto of Friday's UN Security Council resolution calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
