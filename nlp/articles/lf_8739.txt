On a day usually marked by celebrations, some Palestinians returning to their homes this Eid al-Fitr - the holiday which marks the end of the fasting month of Ramadan - are reckoning with the destruction left behind by the war. Israel has effectively ended ground operations in the southern city of Khan Younis and displaced people are returning to discover whether or not their homes are still intact after weeks of heavy fighting. Mohammed Saggah, a returning resident, told AFP news agency: "This house, my home, was a five-storey building and was home to more than 80 people. There is nothing left. " Another woman said she had returned to "a ruined place - no water, no electricity, no columns, no walls and no doors, there's nothing‚Äù. Gaza is not Gaza anymore. Palestinians are returning to the city of Khan Younis, where heavy fighting has left buildings in ruins. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
