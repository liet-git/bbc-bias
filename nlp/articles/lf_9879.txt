T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. The US Department of State is currently holding a briefing, and we're hearing from spokesman Matthew Miller. Rafah is immediately brought up, with Miller saying the US "does not support any military campaign in Rafah going forward, as long as they [Israel] cannot properly account for the 1.1 million people" estimated to be in the city. Miller says Israel must have a plan for Palestinian civilians "that is credible" and achievable. Regarding Sunday evening's strike by Israel in the city, Miller says: "it is not our assessment that this air strike is the launch of a full scale offensive in Rafah". Miller tells the media briefing that Israel has said it is developing a humanitarian plan for civilians in Rafah, and the US "look forward to reviewing" that plan. He also says the position of the Biden administration has been made "quite clear" to Israel's government. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
