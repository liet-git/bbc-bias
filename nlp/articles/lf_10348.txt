An Israeli hostage's family has been reacting to news that Hamas accepted a ceasefire proposal with Israel. Yocheved Lifschitz, 85, was taken by Hamas from Kibbutz Nir Oz in southern Israel on 7 October. She was freed on humanitarian grounds at the end of October 2023. Her husband, 84-year-old Oded, is still being held captive. Responding to the news that Hamas has accepted this truce deal, their daughter, Sharone, says the Israeli government "must accept" it too. “We’ve already lost so much,” Sharone says, adding those who are still alive and being held captive "must come home now". “Government officials who say the hostages are the priority must now show it," she adds. Sharone was speaking before it came through that Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu had issues with the deal . Sharone and her father Oded. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
