The aid workers were travelling in a "deconflicted zone in two armoured cars branded with the WCK logo" and a normal vehicle, the charity's most recent statement about the attack says. World Central Kitchen says it had coordinating movements with Israeli forces, but they were attacked after leaving a warehouse in Deir al-Balah. The charity’s CEO Erin Gore says in the statement she is “heartbroken and appalled” and the charity is pausing operations in Gaza. This is not only an attack against WCK, this is an attack on humanitarian organizations showing up in the most dire of situations where food is being used as a weapon of war. This is unforgivable.
