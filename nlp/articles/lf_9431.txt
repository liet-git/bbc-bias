T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. The sheer volume of footage documenting death, injury and destruction in Gaza today feels as large as at any point of the war. One video from the al-Aqsa hospital shows numerous people with horrific injuries laying on the floor, leaving barely any space on the blood-stained floor for doctors to move between patients. Other videos show a frequent stream of new cases being driven in by car and ambulance and carried into the building. It appears that strikes took place across several locations in central Gaza, but Nuseirat - the location of the IDF operation to release four hostages - seems to have been hit hardest. There are several clips from vicinity of the local market which show bodies littered across the ground. Children are clearly among the victims. As yet unverified footage said to be from nearby Bureji, and Deir al-Balah to the south have also emerged. Footage of a strike near Al-Awda hospital in Nuseirat. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
