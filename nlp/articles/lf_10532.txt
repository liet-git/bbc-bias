T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. People in Rafah have begun to flee to the European Hospital in the southern Gaza Strip to take shelter. But the hospital has since told some of them they had to go to al-Mawasi - a coastal area designated a "humanitarian zone" by Israel - where a field hospital would be set up in an attempt to accommodate a huge number of wounded and sick people. Our colleagues over at BBC Arabic's Gaza Today programme have been speaking to people there. Weâ€™ll be sharing their stories here, so stay with us. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
