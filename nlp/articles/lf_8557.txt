T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. World Central Kitchen (WCK) has called for an independent investigation after seven of its workers were killed in an Israeli airstrike in Gaza. The seven victims, who were working for World Central Kitchen (WCK), were killed when their convoy was attacked from the air on Monday. Three of the killed aid workers were British nationals . A Polish national, an Australian, a Palestinian and a dual US-Canadian citizen were also killed. In a statement , the charity says its workers were travelling in vehicles "marked as WCK" and their movements were in "full compliance with Israeli authorities who were aware of their itinerary, route, and humanitarian mission". The group urges Australian, Canadian, United States, Polish, and UK governments to "join us in demanding an independent, third-party investigation into these attacks, including whether they were carried out intentionally or otherwise violated international law. " An independent investigation is the "only way to determine the truth of what happened" and "prevent future attacks" on aid workers, the statement adds. Israel says the strikes were a "grave mistake" and has promised its own investigation. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
