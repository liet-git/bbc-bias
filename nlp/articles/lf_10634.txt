T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) says its operation in the Jenin refugee camp, in the occupied West Bank, has been ongoing for more than 30 hours. It has sparked protests from some Palestinians there. The IDF says it detained hundreds of suspects, searched over 400 buildings, confiscated weapons and ammunition, and destroyed "terrorist infrastructure". It said six laboratories used to make explosives were destroyed, along with several underground shafts in the camp area. We've seen some pictures which appear to show Palestinian demonstrators lighting tyres on fire to add to makeshift road block following the raids. Earlier, the Palestinian health ministry said a 13-year-old boy became the seventh victim to die following the raids and drone attacks in the Jenin area over the past day.
