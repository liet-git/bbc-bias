People in Gaza have been giving us their reactions to the US blocking a UN Security Council resolution calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. Some residents told us they were not surprised by the outcome of Friday night's vote, as they had expected the US to use its veto powers. “This war won’t stop until the US says so,” one woman said. Another resident, Alaa al-Saqa, said he felt like people in Gaza were viewed only as “numbers and breaking news”. He described the US’s move to block the resolution as a “farce”. Rafat abu Danhe said he had “a lot of hope” that the resolution would go through and was “very upset” that it didn’t. “We have only Allah standing with us,” he said. “We are telling all nations - Western and Arab - that we need a ceasefire, because we are living in a tragedy right now. ”. As we’ve been reporting, the UK abstained in the vote, while the 13 other countries in the 15-member Security Council voted in favour of the resolution. The US has defended its position, calling the resolution "imbalanced" and "divorced from reality". Meanwhile, Israel's Ambassador to the UN, Gilad Erdan, has thanked the US for blocking the resolution, which he said would “enable Hamas’ terrorists to stay in power in Gaza and does not condemn Hamas or call for the release of the hostages”. "We have only Allah standing with us," says Rafat abu Danhe. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
