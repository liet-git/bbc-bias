The latest violence in Gaza follows two days of talks between Israel and Hamas with mediators in Cairo, Egypt. There has been little progress, with both Israel and Hamas saying they will not give ground on key demands, but discussions are expected to resume today. Hamas said its delegation would travel to Qatar to consult with the group's leadership. The truce proposal is believed to involve a 40-day pause in fighting, allowing the release of hostages in Gaza and a number of Palestinian prisoners being held in Israeli jails. Hamas said it viewed the current proposal in a "positive light", but the main sticking point appears to be whether the ceasefire deal would be permanent or temporary. The group is insisting any deal makes a specific commitment towards an end to the war, but Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected that on Sunday. "The state of Israel cannot accept this [Hamas's demands], we are not prepared to accept a situation in which the Hamas brigades come out of their bunkers, take control of Gaza again, rebuild their military infrastructure, and return to threatening the citizens of Israel in the settlements surrounding the southern mountains, in all parts of the country. "This will be a terrible defeat for the state of Israel," he added. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
