We’ll be hearing from: Former Cabinet Secretary Lord Mark Sedwill , who was the UK's top civil servant during the first part of the Covid-19 pandemic. He was replaced in the role by Simon Case in September 2020, amid tensions between him and senior members of former Prime Minister Boris Johnson's team. Baroness Valerie Amos , who is a former Labour cabinet minister and UN under-secretary.

She was the first black “knight or lady companion” member of the order since its foundation in 1348. Comedian and broadcaster Ruby Wax will also be on the panel. In 2015 she was awarded an OBE for her services to mental health. Baroness Amos became the first black "knight or lady companion" member of the Order of the Garter in 2022. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
