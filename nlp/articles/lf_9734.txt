The IDF goes on to set out the military's movements. It says they then tracked the convoy, including the aid lorry, to a warehouse. At this point the convoy splits, the aid lorry remains in the warehouse, and four SUV type cars emerge. One of those vehicles heads north, and is then shown to contain gunmen, with weapons clearly visible from the drone footage, as they emerge next to another aid warehouse. The IDF says that these gunmen were not targeted, because of their proximity to an aid facility. Meanwhile, three remaining vehicles, that belong to World Central Kitchen, begins to head south. The drone team, the army says, now working under the assumption that they are dealing with Hamas militants and not an aid convoy, had misidentified one of the aid workers as gunmen, and claimed to have seen them enter one of the three WCK cars. No footage of this moment was provided, but the military investigation concluded that it was a “misclassification. . . they saw that it’s a rifle but at the end of the day it was a bag”. Under the mistaken belief that one vehicle now contained a gunman, authorisation to fire a missile is sought, and granted by superior officers. At 23:09 the first vehicle is struck, two minutes later the second, and at 23:13 the third final, fatal strike is launched, the IDF says. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
