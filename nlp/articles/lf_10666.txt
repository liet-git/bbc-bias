So what’s the reaction from the UN’s humanitarian wing in Geneva? UN aid agencies have been pleading for a ceasefire for weeks, so they are sure to welcome the general assembly’s call for one, but they also know this is a non-binding, symbolic move, and unlikely to change anything on the ground. Aid workers want to do what they are supposed to do in conflict: bring support to civilians caught up in it; Israeli hostages and Palestinians in Gaza. But such is the ferocity of the fighting that they, and their supplies, are penned in in Rafah, just inside Gaza’s border with Egypt. Just this morning Richard Peeperkorn, the head of the World Health Organization’s team in Gaza, described a highly risky mission to supply a hospital in northern Gaza, where aid workers found critically injured patients lying on the floor  "in every room, every corridor, the courtyard…it is a disaster zone". Going to that hospital, the WHO team came under fire. Returning, Dr Peeperkorn said long waits at military checkpoints risked the lives of very seriously injured patients the WHO was trying to evacuate. Even if the general assembly got its wish for an immediate ceasefire, UN aid agencies say repairing the destruction from this conflict, in particular its shattered hospitals, will take months, perhaps years.
