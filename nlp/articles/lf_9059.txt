T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. So far this morning, we've seen footage of police breaching the perimeter on one side of the encampment - now we can see police at the ready to enter where weâ€™re standing at UCLA. Protesters have barricaded the encampments with plywood. You can hear hammering every so often as they try to reinforce it. Police have warned repeatedly that protesters should leave or face arrest, but protesters continue to shout that they will not go. Some protesters have armed themselves with makeshift riot gear including hard hats and umbrellas. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
