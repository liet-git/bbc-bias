Pro-Palestinian protesters who set up a camp outside an historic graduation hall have left the area, saying the University of Cambridge has "agreed to negotiate". The Cambridge for Palestine group set up tents last week outside King's College and later moved to the lawn outside Senate House. The group, protesting against the war in Gaza, left Senate House Thursday. The university maintained it supported "protest within the law". The encampment had forced the university to move graduation ceremonies planned for Friday and Saturday from Senate House - where students have done so since the 18th Century - to another location. As they left, the group wrote on Instagram that its "goal from the Senate House yard occupation has been accomplished". Graduating students lined up outside Downing College instead of Senate House. A university spokesperson said: "We regret that due to the presence of protesters on Senate House lawn, we have taken the very difficult decision to make alternative arrangements for the degree congregations this weekend. "All students who want to graduate this weekend will still be able to attend their degree congregation at an alternative location that is fitting of the occasion. " Prof Bhaskar Vira, pro-vice-chancellor for education, previously said: "The university has been in regular and ongoing contact with students who have been impacted by the tragic events in Gaza and Palestine. "We support freedom of speech and protest within the law. " Follow Cambridgeshire news on Facebook, external, Instagram, external and X, external. Got a story?
