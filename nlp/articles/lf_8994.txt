Egypt says it has put forward a framework proposal to end the war between Israel and Hamas and is waiting for responses from the two sides. It said the plan contains a three-stage programme that ends in a ceasefire. Diaa Rashwan, head of Egypt's State Information Service, said the plan was an attempt "to bring viewpoints between all concerned parties closer, in an effort to stop Palestinian bloodshed and the aggression against the Gaza Strip and restore peace and stability to the region". Reports say the plan includes hostage releases, a multi-stage ceasefire and the idea of a post-war Gaza administration. Cairo says more details will be released after it has heard from Israel and Hamas. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
