A friend of James Kirby, one of the three British men killed in Gaza, has told the BBC that seeing the suffering of the people in Gaza would have "made him want to do something immediately". Mark Townsend served with James in Afghanistan in 2011, and they quickly became close friends. "I did numerous patrols with him. I was a medic and taught him advanced first aid, which he used many times both in Afghanistan and beyond. "No matter how tired at the end of a patrol, he always made sure everyone was safe and well before thinking about himself," he says. Mark says he had a tear in his eye when a friend, who also served with them both in Afghanistan, sent him a link to news of James's death. "James's heart was the biggest part of his body. The suffering that people are obviously going through in Gaza would have made him want to do something immediately. "He was a team leader, extremely professional, and extremely kind," he adds.
