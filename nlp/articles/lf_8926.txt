T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. As the UN vote is expected soon, the pressure on Israel over humanitarian aid reaching Gaza is growing. International aid organisations have been warning about the dire humanitarian situation in the Strip for weeks. A quarter of households - roughly 500,000 people - are facing "catastrophic conditions", a UN food security agency found on Thursday. It says the territory's entire population of roughly 2.2 million people is suffering acute food shortages. "No-one in Gaza is safe from starvation," said Cindy McCain from the UN's World Food Programme (WFP), warning that Gaza is at risk of famine if the war continues. Limited numbers of trucks have been bringing aid into Gaza from Egypt for weeks, but the WFP recently estimated that just 10% of the food needed is currently getting into the territory. Currently, Israel monitors all aid and fuel deliveries to Gaza. A Palestinian child, holding an empty pot, waits near rubble to receive food distributed by volunteers. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
