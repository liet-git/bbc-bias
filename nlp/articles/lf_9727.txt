BBC Verify has been studying images shared on social media of the aftermath of Monday's attack to try to piece together what we know about the incident that killed seven World Central Kitchen (WCK) workers. The charity says the aid workers were travelling in three cars - two of them armoured. It says the convoy's movements had been co-ordinated with the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). The convoy had unloaded more than 100 tonnes of food supplies at a warehouse in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza, according to the charity. By analysing images of three heavily damaged vehicles - one of them bearing a WCK logo on the roof - BBC Verify has worked out their locations. They are around 2.5km (1.5 miles) apart, which suggests there was more than one strike. Read more here. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
