Let's take a look at the latest lines we've been following for you today as pressure has been mounting on Israel after seven people working for food aid charity World Central Kitchen (WCK) were killed in an Israeli strike in Gaza. In terms of international reaction , British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said he was “appalled” by the deaths and urged Israel to "take immediate steps" to protect aid workers and facilitate humanitarian operations in Gaza. US President Joe Biden has said he's “outraged and heartbroken” by the aid workers' deaths and that the investigation into them “must be swift” and “must bring accountability”. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has called the incident “completely unacceptable" and says it would “add to the concern” about the ongoing loss of life in Gaza. Concerns have also been raised about aid supplies in Gaza, as the region is on the brink of famine. After the deaths of its aid workers, WCF suspended its operations and aid travelling by sea to Gaza is returning to Cyprus. Several charities have been speaking out since the attack, with Action Against Hunger, Save the Children and Islamic Relief all saying they would continue to work in Gaza. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
