As we just reported, the confirmation of Sahar Baruch's death comes a day after a video was released which was claimed by Hamas to show aftermath of a failed Israeli rescue operation . The footage - which has not been verified by the BBC - appeared to show a man speaking several weeks ago. Blood was seen on the floor - as well as military equipment, which Hamas claimed to have captured. The video ended with gruesome images of a bloodied body, which appeared to be of the same hostage. Israel said two of its soldiers were seriously injured in an attempt to rescue one of the hostages still being held in Gaza. A military spokesman said no hostage had been found but that a number of Hamas gunmen had been killed. It was not clear if he was talking about the same incident described in the Hamas video, and the statement announcing Baruchâ€™s death did not specify details. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
