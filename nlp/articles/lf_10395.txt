The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has been dropping flyers in the eastern area of Rafah calling on civilians to evacuate ahead of a planned operation in the city. There are two different versions - red and blue. In the red version, the IDF tells residents of specific areas in Rafah where their forces "will be operating", and warns "anyone found near terrorist organisations endangers themselves and their family members". It urges citizens to move to the "humanitarian area" in al-Mawasi, and to avoid heading north of Wadi Gaza, or nearing the eastern and southern security fences. The blue version, meanwhile, announces the expansion of the zone where it says "humanitarian aid will continue". T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
