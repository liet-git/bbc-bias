Earlier we heard from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau who said it was "absolutely unacceptable that aid workers were killed by the Israeli Defense Force". Trudeau said he was "heartbroken" for the families of those killed and for the organisation that is trying to "counter the extraordinarily devastating humanitarian crisis going on in Gaza right now". He joined calls for a full investigation into the strike and emphasised the need for "clarity on how this happened". He added that the international community must push "continually towards a ceasefire" so that "no more aid workers are at risk of being killed in the enclave". T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
