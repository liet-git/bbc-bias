Pat McFadden describes yesterday's row in the Commons as "unseemly". McFadden told Radio 4's Today programme: "It's become about Parliament, it's become about process rather than the need for humanitarian action to protect people. " McFadden said there needed to be a consensus in the House on supporting a ceasefire in Gaza. "We've all spoken together, united about the need to support our friends in Ukraine against the barbarity of Putin and his regime. We should have been doing the same on Gaza. " He said Parliament needed "to be a voice for those in the Gaza Strip" and demanded "increasing resolve to make sure that we can make a difference". "We've got to find a way through this and remember it's got to be about Gaza", he added. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
