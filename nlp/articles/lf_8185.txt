Conservative MP Stephen Crabb says parliament needs to unite around calls on Hamas to release the hostages it took during the 7 October attacks. "My problem with the SNP motion - there is no mention of the sexual violence and rape as a weapon of war against Israeli women. These crimes were recorded on mobile phones and body cams. Hamas fighters committing the most barbaric acts," Crabb says. Crabb goes on to criticise the SNP motion for "no mention of Hamas guilt" in the conflict. "At the heart of it, it lets Hamas off the hook for what happened on 7 October," he says. The backdrop for today's debate is a concerted campaign to pressure and bully MPs to fall into line with a very specific wording about a ceasefire, he says, adding that has an objective of "keeping Hamas in place in Gaza".
