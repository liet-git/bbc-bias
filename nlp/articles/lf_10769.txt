We're expecting to hear from the International Court of Justice in about 30 minutes. Here's a quick reminder of what today is about and how we got here: The ICJ, the UN's top court, will today consider emergency measures put forward by South Africa, which include ordering Israel to stop its military operations in Gaza. However, a verdict on South Africa's allegation of genocide is not expected for years - Israel strongly denies the accusation, calling it "baseless" The ICJ has no means of enforcing an order against Israel, but such a ruling would place further pressure on the country to, for example, work towards a new temporary ceasefire or allow in more aid to Gaza. Weeks of mediation by Qatar and Egypt, with US involvement, to reach a new pause in fighting have brought no breakthrough - though in recent days, reports have suggested "serious" progress is being made in indirect talks held with delegations from Israel and Hamas. Almost 26,000 Palestinians - mostly women and children - have been killed and tens of thousands injured, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza, since Israel began its retaliatory offensive in the territory. This was triggered by an unprecedented attack on Israel by Hamas on 7 October, in which about 1,200 people , mainly civilians, were killed and some 240 people taken hostage. Correction 13 February: This post wrongly reported that about 1,300 people had been killed following the 7 October attack by Hamas. This was based on counting those who later died from their injuries in addition to the figure of more than 1,200. The article has been amended to now refer to about 1,200 deaths, a figure which includes those deaths and which Israel says is not final. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
