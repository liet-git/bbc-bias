Good morning and welcome to our live coverage. Many Gazans are marking the Islamic festival of Eid al-Fitr in circumstances far different from last year, amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas. Some are returning to their homes in the southern city of Khan Younis after most Israeli troops pulled out of the area, although for many they are coming back to scenes of destruction. That withdrawal comes ahead of an expected assault on the southern city of Rafah. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he has set a date for a military offensive there, despite growing warnings that it could lead to high civilian casualties. The US is among Israel’s allies opposed to a Rafah offensive and President Joe Biden has warned he believes Netanyahu is making a “mistake” in his handling of the Gaza war. He says Gaza should have "total access to all food and medicine" for the next six to eight weeks.
