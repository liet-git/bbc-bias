The UN resolution’s focus is on the urgency to get desperately needed humanitarian aid to Palestinians throughout the entire Gaza Strip. The UN has been clear that they need a ceasefire to be able to deliver aid at scale in any meaningful way, that nowhere is safe in Gaza due to Israel’s relentless bombardment campaign. This resolution falls short of that. The original draft called for a sustainable cessation of hostilities, but the final version has been watered down and now calls for creating conditions for one. The resolution seeks to elevate the UN’s presence in the region. It creates a coordinator to oversee a UN mechanism that will be set up, with the goal of speeding up and streamlining the distribution of aid. It requests the coordinator be appointed “expeditiously” but it’s unclear how long a vetting process could take. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
