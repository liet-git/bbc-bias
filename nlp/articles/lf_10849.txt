An official at al-Awda Hospital in northern Gaza tells the BBC the building has been "under siege for five days", meaning none of the 250 or so people inside are able to enter or leave. Mohammed Salha describes an increasingly desperate situation - saying the facility only has enough fuel for four days, food for three days, and water for two days. He says it's impossible to get fuel refills, and that "we don't know how to deal with this situation. " He says snipers have shot at a number of people in the hospital  - two of whom were killed - without specifying who was behind the alleged shooting.
