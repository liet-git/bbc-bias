Sixty-year-old Khalil Ahmad abu Sulaym says the situation in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis is “dire”. “Last night we couldn’t sleep and even at this moment, we don’t know where to go. We’ve been displaced for 55 days,” he says. Khalil says he has moved to different parts of Khan Younis in efforts to find somewhere safer, but has not considered trying to flee the city despite “relentless bombing”. “I want to remain in Khan Younis until I am killed here. Even if they try to force me, I will not leave. Even if it means facing death,” he says. He adds that "nowhere in Gaza is safe". Yesterday, Israel said its troops had reached "the heart of Khan Younis" - the largest southern city - on the "most intense" day of fighting in its ground operation. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
