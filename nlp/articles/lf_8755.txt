The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the last operating hospital in Rafah could become non-functional if Israel launches a "full incursion" into the southern Gazan city. "If the incursion would continue, we would lose the last hospital in Rafah," Richard Peeperkorn, the UN agency's representative for Gaza and the West Bank, was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency from Geneva. He added that a contingency plan would "not prevent what we expect: substantial additional mortality and morbidity". Peeperkorn did not publicly name the hospital. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
