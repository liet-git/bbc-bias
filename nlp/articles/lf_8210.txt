 F-N-S-T-A-R-T. 8210 F-N-E-N-D.  D-A-T-E-S-T-A-R-T. 2024-02-21 D-A-T-E-E-N-D.  T-I-T-L-E-S-T-A-R-T. What to expect in the debate and what time is the vote? T-I-T-L-E-E-N-D.  T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. The debate is now under way and we are expecting votes on it by 7pm this evening. But because the Speaker of the House of Commons has unusually allowed both the Labour and Conservative amendments to the SNP’s motion calling for an “immediate ceasefire”, the voting will be slightly complicated. First there will be a vote on the Labour amendment to the SNP motion. If that passes, there will be a final decision on the motion as amended, which will effectively mean a vote on the Labour wording again. If the Labour amendment fails, there will then be a vote on the original SNP motion. That original SNP motion is unlikely to pass, given the government and Labour leadership are opposed to it. There will then be a vote on the government amendment. So there will be multiple votes on the various different wordings tabled by the different parties. We will be here to explain what it all means. But remember – whatever the final version is – the government does not have to act on it. However if MPs call for a ceasefire, it would add to growing international calls for an end to the fighting.
