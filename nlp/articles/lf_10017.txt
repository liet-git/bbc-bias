T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. In Israel, schools were closed to children and public gatherings limited in size as a safety precaution just ahead of Iran’s launch of more than 300 missiles and drones. The easing of the restrictions reflects the military’s view that the threat of a new wave of attacks has passed. After three hours of deliberations, Israel’s war cabinet did not reach a decision yesterday on how to respond to the Iranian attacks. It’s said to favour retaliation but is divided over the timing and scale that should take. Israel’s military is said to have been drawing up options. Israel has said that all of the attack drones and cruise missiles launched by Iran were downed outside of its airspace with the help of its allies, including the US and the UK. Iran has insisted that it gave neighbouring countries, and the US, 72 hours notice of its plan to launch the strikes. However, the US and Israel dispute the timing and say that the aim was to cause significant damage including to a key Israeli airbase. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
