T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. French President Emmanuel Macron has said fighting "terrorism" does not mean to "flatten Gaza or attack civilian populations indiscriminately". Speaking to broadcaster France 5, he called on Israel to end its current battlefield tactics "because it is not appropriate, because all lives are worth the same and we defend them". According to the AFP news agency, Macron also acknowledged "Israel's right to defend itself and fight terror", and called for the protection of civilians and a "truce leading to a humanitarian ceasefire". We cannot let the idea take root that an efficient fight against terrorism implies to flatten Gaza or attack civilian populations indiscriminately. " Emmanuel Macron. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
