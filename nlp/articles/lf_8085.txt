T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. SNP MP Owen Thompson is now telling the House that yesterday's events in the House of Commons were "incredibly disappointing". Thompson says that it was the SNPs "opportunity to put forward our business to the House" and that their voice was made "silent" when a vote on their motion did not go ahead. He asks Penny Mordaunt if "an alternative date" can be given to rectify the situation. Mordaunt tells Thompson that she is "sympathetic" to the SNP being given more time and suggests that it should be "knocked off" some of Labour's time. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
