T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. The UK government has suggested it is preparing to follow the United States in imposing sanctions on Israeli settlers responsible for attacking Palestinians in the West Bank. Andrew Mitchell, the senior Foreign Minister, told MPs the Foreign Secretary, Lord Cameron, had discussed the proposal last week with his US counterpart, Antony Blinken. The US announced last week that Israeli settlers responsible for what it called extremist violence would be subject to a visa ban and would be unable to travel to America. Mitchell was responding to a question from the Shadow Foreign Secretary David Lammy who asked if the government agreed that settlers involved in “attacks, serious criminal activity and fostering hatred” should be subject to travel bans. Mitchell replied by saying that targeted killings of civilians in the West Bank were “completely abhorrent” and the UK was pushing for those responsible to be prosecuted and punished. He added: "In terms of his comment about travel bans, I can tell him that planning is going on. The Foreign Secretary discussed this with his US counterpart last week and I hope it may be possible to say something about that shortly.
