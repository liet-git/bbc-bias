An Oxford-based charity has sent a five-tonne aid shipment to Gaza for those in "desperate" need. On Monday Oxfam sent a truck, loaded with water and sanitation equipment, from its warehouse in Bicester, Oxfordshire. New evacuations into southern Gaza have been ordered after a week-long truce between Israel and Hamas collapsed on Friday.   Nesrine Aly, from Oxfam, said it was "anxious" to get the aid to Gaza. The truck left at 09:30 GMT, loaded with equipment including bladder tanks, tap stands and water testing kits. Ms Aly, who is an international news manager at Oxfam, said: "We don't know how much time it will take to get into Gaza, it all depends on the situation on the border. "We're hoping that this is as fast and as smooth as possible to reach people desperately needing aid.  "The people are really in horrendous, apocalyptic conditions, so they need this aid as soon as possible. " Oxfam said it was calling "for an immediate, permanent ceasefire, the release of all hostages without conditions and full access for the delivery of humanitarian aid, via both Israel and Egypt".
