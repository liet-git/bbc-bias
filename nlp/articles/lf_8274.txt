Health Secretary Victoria Atkins this morning said the government’s motivation behind putting forward its amendment to the SNP motion on the Israel-Gaza war was “consistency”, and called the stance of opposition parties "naive". "We the government have put an amendment down because we are clear we have this consistent policy in Gaza and towards Israel," Atkins told Times Radio. "We are not interested in, frankly, pretty politically naive parliamentary procedures that Labour and others seem to be indulging in," she said. She said the government wanted the war to end, but with “conditions related to hostages and Hamas in power". T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
