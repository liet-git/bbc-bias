 F-N-S-T-A-R-T. 8147 F-N-E-N-D.  D-A-T-E-S-T-A-R-T. 2024-02-21 D-A-T-E-E-N-D.  T-I-T-L-E-S-T-A-R-T. What is an opposition day? T-I-T-L-E-E-N-D.  T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. The row in the House now centres on the very notion of the opposition day. We've been talking a lot about the SNP motion tabled as part of an opposition-day debate. So let us explain what an opposition day is. Opposition days are days in which the opposition parties (which are those not in government, like Labour, the SNP, Lib Dems and so on) choose the subjects debated in the House of Commons. It's an opportunity for those not in government to hold debates on what they view as key issues. There are 20 of these days each year - 17 of these are allocated to the official opposition party, which right now is the Labour party, and the remaining three go to the next-biggest party, which is currently the SNP. So, today the SNP had the opportunity to set the agenda in the House. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
