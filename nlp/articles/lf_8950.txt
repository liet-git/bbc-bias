Welcome to our live coverage of the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, hours after the US described a United Nations resolution on humanitarian aid for Gaza as one "that we can support". US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield rejected claims the latest draft had been watered down, arguing it is "a very strong resolution" - but stopped short of saying whether the US would vote 'yes' or abstain. It comes amid a warning by the UN that Gaza is at risk of famine if the fighting persists. Basic supplies are getting into Gaza, but officials estimates people are getting just 10% of the food that's needed. I'm here in our London newsroom, along with Thomas Mackintosh and Sam Hancock, ready to bring you the latest. Stay with us. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
