If there was any hope the UN resolution – set to be voted on later today - could help ease the situation for Gaza’s civilians, it’s fast draining away. The language agreed by the Americans is vaguer on both an end to the hostilities, and the delivery of aid. Separate talks in Egypt, designed to secure a fresh truce between Israel and Hamas, have also so far failed to deliver results. Israel has said it’s open to a temporary pause in fighting to get more hostages out, but that the war would continue until Hamas was destroyed. Yesterday, Hamas reiterated its refusal to release any captives without a full and permanent end to the war. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
