The Israeli strike that killed seven aid workers in Gaza was "appalling", Unicef says. Tess Ingram, Unicef's communications specialist, told BBC Breakfast: "These were brave humanitarian workers doing their job. "This absolutely should not happen in the line of duty and it is appalling they have been killed. " "In terms of operations, Unicef is staying and delivering", she says but adds that there will "certainly be an impact" from World Central Kitchen pausing their operations - the charity the seven victims worked for- "because they're one of the main players here in the provision of food to the people of Gaza, which as we know are on the brink of a famine". She adds that the situation in Gaza is dangerous for aid workers, saying that "we have lost so many colleagues". "But also, it's really dangerous for people in Gaza," she says, highlighting that the air strikes that killed the aid workers on Monday "are killing people in Gaza on an almost daily basis".
