T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. The US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has said more than 25,000 people have been killed by Israel in Gaza since the 7 October Hamas attacks. Secretary Austin was speaking at a Congressional hearing in Washington, primarily focussed on his hospitalisation. The US department of defence clarified that Austin was citing an estimate from the Hamas-controlled ministry and that the US cannot independently verify them. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has previously said more than 30,000 Palestinians had been killed since Israel began its retaliatory military operation. The Israeli military has said it has killed more than 10,000 fighters in its air strikes and ground operations. Austin also said the US had given Israel 21,000 precision guided missiles since the start of the war. Austin added that he had spoken to his opposite number in Israel, Yoav Gallant, last night and said: "I expect that when we provide munitions to allies and partners they will use them in a responsible way. " He said the decision to halt the provision of security assistance "would not be mine" and insisted that Israel use the weapons provided "in a responsible way. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
