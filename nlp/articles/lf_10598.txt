Israeli leaders appear to have concluded that to deter Iran effectively, they must hit back for firing its massive missile barrage. Visiting the Nevatim air base, which was lightly damaged by the Iranian attack, the Israeli military’s chief of staff, Herzi Halevi, told air force troops that the launch of so many missiles and drones would be met with a response. The challenge for the war cabinet is to find a way to deliver a powerful message without fuelling a regional crisis. Iran launched its unprecedented attack in retaliation for a deadly air strike on its embassy compound in Damascus, which is blamed on Israel, and has signalled that it doesn’t seek further escalation. World leaders have expressed fears there could now be more open warfare between the long-time enemies with the violence emanating from the Gaza war spreading further. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
