The head of the International Chamber of Shipping has told the BBC that consumers were likely to see a rise in the price of goods within weeks because of the cost of re-routing vessels away from Red Sea. Guy Platten says about 20% of the container fleet was being diverted around southern Africa to avoid the risk of attack by Houthi rebels in Yemen - who have been launching missile and drone attacks at vessels in the nearby Bab al-Mandab strait since mid-November. He says the longer journey added up to 14 extra days to a ship's voyage and that shipping costs had already increased as a result. The Iranian-backed Houthis are an ally of Hamas and  claim they have been attacking "Israel-linked" ships in the vital shipping lane, which connects Europe to Asia and is a key route for oil and gas shipments from the Gulf. In response, the US government has set up an international taskforce to protect Red Sea shipping , which has led to many anti-ship missiles being shot down and a thwarted hijacking attempt on a Danish vessel last week .
