The Palestinian representative to the UN, Riyad Mansour, has welcomed today's resolution - but says it is overdue. "It has taken six months, over 100,000 Palestinians killed and maimed, two million displaced, and famine, for this council to finally demand an immediate ceasefire," Mansour tells the UN. He says the draft resolution was a “vote for humanity to prevail, for life to prevail". "The Palestinians in Gaza pleaded and appealed, shouted, cried, cursed, prayed, defied the odds to survive time and time again. And yet continued to face death, destruction and displacement, depravation and disease. And an occupation-made famine. “Their ordeal must come to an end, and it must come to an immediate end now.
