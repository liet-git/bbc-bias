We've been hearing from some of the people in Rafah affected by the military's order for residents to move to areas designated as humanitarian zones by Israel. Rafah resident Ghada Mannaa has been describing the areas to UN officials: The safe areas they are talking about are completely unsafe, and not suitable for habitation at all. " Rafah resident Ghada Mannaa. Ghada continues by saying "there is also no electricity available, nor water, nor a health system". "The so-called safe areas are the same areas that have been hit and targeted since the start of the war, so we are in a dilemma here of what to do," Ghada adds. Ghada goes on to say "that's why people are scattered in the streets, because we are not sure what to do. We either go to the safe areas to get hit there or simply stay here and die". Another person, Diyaa Nahhal, has said: Weâ€™ve been trying to leave since the early morning, but with no clue where to go. " Rafah resident Diyaa Nahhal.
