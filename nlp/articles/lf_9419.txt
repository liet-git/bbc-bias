Sir Keir Starmer's success was sketched across the map of England at the local elections last week. What could possibly go wrong for him? A lot, actually. The general election is still months away and there are plenty of potential pitfalls between Starmer and the shiny black door of No 10. First, conversations across the Labour Party suggest the danger of taking victory for granted - being complacent - is the number one risk. Second, while the Tories have been stuck in the doldrums in the polls for months, Labour cannot predict or control much of what happens before the election. On 6 October last year, the world didn't know what was about to happen in Israel. The shocking events of 7 October and the intense conflict since then has unsettled many in the Labour Party. There is just no telling what other events could provoke further disagreement, or what unexpected events could shift the polls. Last, Starmer faces a classic political conundrum. To win, it helps if you look like a winner - but overstretch yourself, and it could all go wrong. You can read Laura Kuenssbergâ€™s analysis here. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
