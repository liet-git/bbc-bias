Hello and welcome to our live coverage as Israel says it has approved the opening of two routes into Gaza to allow more aid into the territory. The Erez Gate in northern Gaza will be temporarily re-opened for the first time since the start of the war and the Ashdod Port will also be opened for humanitarian deliveries. More aid from Jordan will also be allowed to enter via the Kerem Shalom Crossing. It comes just hours after a phone call between US President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - their first direct contact since an Israeli strike killed seven aid workers in Gaza on Monday. Biden warned Netanyahu that Israel must take steps to prevent civilian harm and humanitarian suffering if it wanted to maintain US support, according to a readout of the phone call.
