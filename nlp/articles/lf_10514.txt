We're now hearing more from the US, who say Israel undertaking a major operation in the southern Gazan city of Rafah will not advance Israel or America's objective of defeating Hamas. White House national security spokesman John Kirby says President Joe Biden does not believe "smashing into Rafah" will advance "that objective". Kirby says there are better ways to go after what is left of Hamas in Gaza than by launching a major ground operation. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
