In a call with reporters just a few minutes ago, national security spokesman John Kirby said the White House was "monitoring" the IDF operation in Rafah, although he declined to comment on whether Israel had informed the US about their intention to take control of the Rafah crossing on the Gaza side. In his remarks, Kirby said - as he has repeatedly over the last several days - that President Biden and the US had "made clear" their opposition to a large-scale operation in the city. "We've been very consistent about concerns," he added. "We're going to be watching this closely. " Additionally, Kirby said that the US was "working hard" to ensure the uninterrupted flow of humanitarian assistance across the Rafah crossing, as well as Kerem Shalom. "Israel has committed to reopen Kerem Shalom at President Biden's requests," he added. "We need to see it happen soon. " Israel is not allowing humanitarian workers access to the Rafah crossing, after taking control of the Gaza side of the border with Egypt. Kerem Shalom crossing was closed after a rocket attack by Hamas fighters over the weekend killed four Israeli soldiers in the area. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
