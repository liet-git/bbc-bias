The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has warned countries against targeting strikes at Iran's nuclear facilities. Isfahan - where the strike is thought to have taken place - is home to several of the country's nuclear facilities. Rafael Grossi told BBC Radio 4's PM programme that he let out a "big sigh of relief" after hearing no nuclear facilities had been affected by the strike. His team, he says, had been "up most of the night. . . following the situation". A strike on Iran's nuclear installations would have been "a terrible thing", Grossi says, but says that he's "not sure how effective that would be" due to Iran housing its facilities underground. He believes the "issue of targeting nuclear installations seems to be getting on in the world these days, and we consider that absolutely deplorable". T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
