T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. We've been hearing from Israeli authorities about their efforts to get citizens to move out of the most intense fighting areas in Gaza, including the city of Khan Younis in the south. "We are dropping leaflets with QR codes that opens a map guiding Gazans to safer areas," IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari has said. The IDF has urged civilians to move to Rafah near the Egyptian border, or to al-Mawasi, a thin strip of territory along the Mediterranean coast. But Palestinians in the affected areas have spoken of trouble accessing the online map, and UN officials have called the idea of any "safe zone" a "dangerous false narrative". "These are tiny patches of barren land. They have no water, no facilities, no shelter from the cold, no sanitation," Unicef spokesman James Elder told the BBC on Tuesday, in an apparent reference to al-Mawasi. More on that story here.
