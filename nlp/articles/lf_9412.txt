David Cameron continues to be questioned about Israel's planned offensive in Rafah and if it is a point of principle for the UK to send a strong political message and stop arms sales to Israel. "The last time I was urged to do that, I didn't do that and just a few days later there was a brutal attack by Iran on Israel. . . I think it would have sent an entirely wrong message," he says. Cameron says that the better option is that Hamas must take the hostage deal. "Just to simply announce today that we will change our approach on arms exports, it would make Hamas stronger and it would make a hostage deal less likely," he adds. UK arms exports change would make Hamas stronger, says Cameron. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
