Reports from Rafah say that Israeli tanks are massed close to built-up areas. Residents have told us there is the constant sound of shelling. Palestinian armed groups, Hamas and Islamic Jihad say they’re targeting Israeli forces on the eastern outskirts of the city, firing mortars and anti-tank missiles. While a Hamas delegation is said to have left talks in Cairo to consult the group’s  leaders in Doha, the CIA director, William Burns, is reportedly back there after meetings with Israeli leaders in Jerusalem. The US has continued to indicate that a deal on a ceasefire and hostage release can still be reached.  However, Israeli media reports say that Israeli officials are not optimistic. Some claim that the US president’s comments to CNN will undermine the chances of a deal, because they reduce Israeli leverage in the negotiations. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
