We’re wrapping up our live coverage of the ICJ ruling shortly, so in case you missed it earlier here are the top lines from today’s announcement: In a dramatic ruling, the UN’s top court has ordered Israel to immediately halt its military offensive in Rafah, southern Gaza. The International Court of Justice also ordered Israel to allow the Rafah border crossing with Egypt to be kept open up for humanitarian aid “at scale” and demanded the release of all Israeli hostages still held in Gaza. It acted in support of a South African application last week which sought a number of measures against Israel, accusing it of stepping up what it says is a genocide. Israel has vehemently denied the allegation and signalled it would ignore any order to halt its operation. Ahead of Friday's ruling, a government spokesperson said "no power on Earth will stop Israel from protecting its citizens and going after Hamas in Gaza" Hamas, which runs Gaza, and the Palestinian Authority, which governs parts of the occupied West Bank, have both welcomed the ruling. Minutes after it was delivered, Israel warplanes carried out a series of air strikes on the Shaboura camp in the centre of Rafah. South Africa requested the emergency measures as part of a larger case, claiming Israel was committing genocide in Gaza. The ICJ can make legally binding rulings in disputes between countries, but has little way of enforcing its orders.
