T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. At a press conference in Israel, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan says he's had constructive conversations with Israel about  the way it's waging war against Hamas, including a transition from "high-intensity" fighting to more "precise" targeting of the group's leaders. Speaking to reporters, Sullivan wouldn't be drawn on timelines as to when the conflict might come to an end, although he says the US agrees it could take months. He says the Israeli government has indicated it doesn't have any long-term plans to occupy Gaza but agrees that the Palestinian Authority needs to be revitalised in order for there to be an eventual "negotiated outcome".
