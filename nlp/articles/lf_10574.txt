Iran’s unprecedented strike was a powerful jolt which split Israeli leaders, and the public, over what to do next. The latest poll from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem says 52% of Israelis believe their country should hold fire. The rest disagree. An even bigger 74% say don’t attack if it undermines Israel’s alliance with regional and world powers. There’s also heated argument inside the war cabinet. They agree - Israel must hit back in some way. Former generals are said to be pushing for immediate retaliation. Others want to first strengthen Israel’s support from key capitals. And targets range too - from a direct strike on Iran, or on its proxies somewhere in the region. Prime Minister Netanyahu appears to be deploying tactics of his own. Israeli media say he’s refusing to take telephone calls from world leaders. Of course he’s very busy. But he knows all too well what they’ll say - “don’t do it. " It also sends a signal to his right-wing ministers, including one who urged him to “go berserk,” that he’s standing up to world pressure - for now. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
