The worldwide writers' association PEN International says it is "gravely concerned" at the arrest by Israeli forces of a prominent Palestinian artist, Ahmed Tobasi , and the general manager of the Freedom Theatre in Jenin, Mustafa Sheta . Speaking to the BBC, the theatre's associate artistic director Zoe Lafferty said Israeli soldiers had broken into the theatre on Wednesday morning as part of a raid on the camp, destroyed its offices, and later stormed Sheta's house. Tobasi was born in Jenin refugee camp, joined the armed group Palestinian Islamic Jihad as a teenager and spent four years in an Israeli prison before joining the theatre. One of the plays he has performed in, And Here I Am, tells his own story. PEN International has called for both men to be released immediately. Israel has not yet commented on the reports - the BBC has asked the Israeli authorities about the men's reported arrest. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
