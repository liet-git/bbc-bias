Police were called after protesters blocked an entrance to a football stadium hosting a military conference. Members of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC) have been protesting on Tuesday against what they claim is an "arms fair" at Bristol's Ashton Gate. Campaigners say some companies present are producing weapons being used by Israel to kill Palestinians in Gaza. A stadium spokesperson said it "facilitated" campaigners' "right to protest". PSC previously demanded permission be revoked for the "Future Indirect Fires" event. The event has been described online as a chance to "examine the likely development of joint lethal and non lethal indirect fires". An online preview says it is being run by Omega Conferences & Events in conjunction with the "Joint Military Training & Simulation Conference" and will include "presentations from senior officers from many different countries". Bristol resident Jennifer Stevenson said what is going on in Gaza is "sickening". She added: "I've come here today because I think its wrong that there's an arms trade on our doorstep and it's not what we want in Bristol. "A spokesperson for Ashton Gate Stadium said: "The conference is a private event. Everyone has a right to protest, and we have facilitated that. "A spokesperson for Avon and Somerset Constabulary said: "We were called at around 7am today to a protest at Ashton Gate Stadium, in Bedminster, Bristol. "Officers are in attendance and are engaging with all parties to facilitate a peaceful protest. " Follow BBC Bristol on Facebook, external, X, external and Instagram, external.
