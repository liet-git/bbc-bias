 F-N-S-T-A-R-T. 10643 F-N-E-N-D.  D-A-T-E-S-T-A-R-T. 2023-12-13 D-A-T-E-E-N-D.  T-I-T-L-E-S-T-A-R-T. Israel is trying to control the media narrative. T-I-T-L-E-E-N-D.  T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Israel continues to prevent independent journalistic access to Gaza – it will do so until there is a ceasefire and even then, if Israel remains in control of the territory, I am not sure we will be allowed in. I don't think the Israeli forces are worried about whether we are safe in there or not – I think there are things they don't want us to see and that they want to master the media battlefield. So they are fighting on all fronts and controlling the media is one of them. If you look at Israeli TV, it is focused 24/7 on Gaza of course. But what you don’t see is Palestinian suffering. You see troops, the home front, constant reminders of what happened on 7 October. You see the pain of the hostage families. What you do not see are stories of individual Palestinians, nor the colossal scale of the damage going on in Gaza. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
