The US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan is meeting the Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas later on today. The focus of their talks is expected to centre on to discussions around the future governance of Gaza. The Palestinian Authority governs part of the West Bank not under Israel's control, and is separate to the government that operates in Gaza, which is run by Hamas. Yesterday Sullivan met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who said that his country would fight its war with Hamas until they achieve an "absolute victory". Sullivan told Netanyahu that the US would like to see a lower-intensity military campaign in Gaza, focusing on high-value targets to help protect civilians, according to US officials. Appearing on Israeli TV, he said: "I'm not here to lecture or dictate. Israel is a friend and a partner. We sit down and we consult and we talk as friends. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
