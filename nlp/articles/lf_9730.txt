Poland’s foreign ministry has handed a diplomatic note of protest to Israel’s ambassador following the deaths in Gaza of seven people, including a Polish citizen, in the Israeli strike on an aid convoy on Monday. Deputy defence minister Andrzej Szejna has said that the ambassador, Yacov Livne, has apologised for the deaths of the World Central Kitchen workers, including 35-year-old Pole Damian Soból, during a meeting on Friday at the foreign ministry. He says the ambassador will not be expelled from the country. Livne has been heavily criticised for his reaction to their deaths. He has repeatedly expressed Israel’s deep regret for the attack but has rejected accusations the attack constituted a war crime. The ambassador has accused Poland’s far-right deputy parliamentary speaker, Krzysztof Bosak, of being an antisemite for making such an accusation. Polish President Andrzej Duda has called the ambassador the biggest problem for the two countries' relations. Szejna says Poland expects Israel to conduct a transparent investigation into the attack and pay compensation to Soból’s family. Yacov Livne, the Israeli Ambassador to Poland. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
