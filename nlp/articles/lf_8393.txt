"There is no water and no food to eat," she told the charity ActionAid, which has shared her story. "My little girl has a rash on her skin due to the lack of cleanliness here. Our situation is very difficult. How do you drink water? Is it enough for you and the baby? Of course not! There is no water to drink. There is no clean water. We barely quench our thirst. " Khitam said her four other children "have been wanting to eat since the morning but there is no bread". She gave birth during the war, and described fleeing her home because of Israeli bombing just two days after giving birth. I was carrying my daughter and running. We were walking under missiles and shelling, sitting for a while to rest on the pavement and in the streets. ‚Äù.
