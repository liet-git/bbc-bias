As we've been reporting, the UN Security Council will vote this afternoon on a draft resolution by the US calling for a ceasefire in Gaza and the return of the hostages held there by Hamas. The US, along with Egypt and Qatar, has been working on a deal between Israel and Hamas in Doha to secure a ceasefire in exchange for the release of the hostages. Of the 253 hostages taken by Hamas during the 7 October attacks on Israel, 130 still remain in Gaza, and Israel believes at least 30 of them are dead. Families of the hostages still kept in Gaza have organised campaigns fighting for their release but in the five months since the attack, the focus on the hostages has been fading – and they are having to fight hard to keep them in the public eye. Rachel Goldberg-Polin’s 23-year-old son, Hersh, was kidnapped on October 7. She has not gone back to work since and campaigns full-time for the release of her son. "I believe it and I have to believe it, that he will come back to us,” she says and adds the agony must end, and not only for Israelis. "There are thousands and thousands of innocent civilians in Gaza who are suffering," she says. "There is so much suffering to go around. And I would love for our leaders, all of them, to say, 'we're going to do what we have to do so that just the normal people can stop suffering'. " Hersh Goldberg-Polin stands next to his mother Rachel. Hersh was last seen in a Hamas video after the 7 October attack. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
