If you're just joining us, here's a quick recap of the latest developments in the Israel-Gaza conflict. Israel says it has carried out attacks on more than 60 "terror targets" in Gaza in the past day. At least 18 people have been killed in an airstrike on a residential building in the southern city of Rafah, according to Palestinian media. The overall death toll in Gaza has risen to 32,414, the Hamas-run Palestinian health ministry reports. There have also been reports of Hezbollah firing projectiles into northern Israel, although no deaths have been reported. The latest violence comes after a UN resolution was passed on Monday calling for an immediate ceasefire. Qatar says the resolution, which passed after the US did not veto it, had had no "immediate effect" on the latest round of negotiations between Israel and Hamas in Doha. Israel has disputed this, saying Hamas has been emboldened by the UN vote. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed his country would not surrender to Hamas' "delusional demands" in the talks, which are aimed at securing a temporary truce and the release of hostages.
