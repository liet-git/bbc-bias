Thank you for joining us today. We've been speaking to Gazans throughout the day to bring you a more detailed look at how dramatically people's daily lives have changed after nearly five months of war. A 12-year-old girl told us how she helps support her family by selling crisps on the side of the road. One civil servant said her family is forced to sleep hungry because even bread is not always available. She has four children and is concerned about their education. A tech entrepreneur told us about a hub he runs in Rafah, which allows people to access the internet with the help of solar panels for electricity. He worries his money will soon run out. A media graduate from the north spoke about sharing a tent with seven other people in Rafah and how he wants to go home. A doctor in central Gaza described how the over-crowded conditions at her hospital are fuelling the spread of disease, while another doctor in the north explained how electricity shortages are shutting down key hospital services. Around 1.7m Gazans are living in emergency shelters or informal sites due to the fighting. The Hamas-run health ministry says 29,700 Palestinians have been killed since the war began. It's now 21:15 in Gaza and we are ending our special coverage for the day.
