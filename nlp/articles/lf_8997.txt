According to the UN Human Rights Office , the Israeli Air Force reportedly carried out more than 50 strikes across central Gaza on Sunday and Monday, including on Maghazi refugee camp. Two strikes hit seven residential buildings in Maghazi, killing an estimated 86 Palestinians and injuring many more, the UN statement said. An unknown number of people were also believed to be trapped under the rubble. Another UN organisation said the affected houses belonged to the Qandil, Abu Ahed, Abu Hamida, Abu Rahma, Si-Salem and al-Nawasra families. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) also said a hospital in the central town of Deir al-Balah had admitted 209 injured and 131 dead following bombings on Sunday night in Maghazi and the nearby Bureij refugee camp. Photographs from the scene on Monday appeared to show that at least one building was destroyed as a result of the strike, while four neighbouring buildings were severely damaged. Where is Maghazi? Maghazi is located in the centre of Gaza, and is one of the smaller refugee camps in the territory, both in terms of size and population. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, says it is characterised by narrow alleys and a high population density. It covers an area of 0.6 sq km and was home to more than 33,000 UN-registered refugees before the war. Israel Gaza: At least 70 reported dead in Israeli strike on Gaza refugee camp. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
