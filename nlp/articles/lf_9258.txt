Israel has announced what it called a "minimal" increase in fuel supplies to southern Gaza. It said the fuel supply increase was "necessary to avoid a humanitarian collapse and the outbreak of epidemics". PM Benjamin Netanyahu's office added that: "The minimal amount will be determined from time to time by the War Cabinet according to the morbidity situation and humanitarian situation in the Strip. " It follows international pressure to allow more aid into Gaza, although the UN says it won't be enough. It said the ability to receive incoming loads of aid "has been significantly impaired" due to several factors, including  a shortage of trucks and staff not being able to get to the Rafah crossing, where aid comes through, because of fighting in the south.
