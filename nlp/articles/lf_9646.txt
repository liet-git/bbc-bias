The announcement by the Israeli military that troops had been pulled out from Khan Younis – and that only one brigade remained in the area – means the end of this phase of intense combat operations in southern Gaza. The army has said those units had accomplished their mission there, and that they were now preparing for future operations in Gaza. A key questions is, what does this mean for a possible offensive into Rafah? Israel says it is imperative to enter Gaza’s southernmost city to eliminate Hamas - and be able to claim victory. More than a million Palestinians are sheltering there, in tents, improvised camps and overcrowded shelters. The UN says any military operation could lead to a humanitarian disaster, and virtually everyone outside Israel is against the idea of a major offensive there, including the US, Israel’s closest ally. Israeli authorities say they have a plan to evacuate civilians, but Biden officials do not seem to be convinced. They want Israel to carry out targeted operations against Hamas, instead of a huge offensive that would lead to another mass displacement of civilians. With or without American support, an offensive is not imminent. Yoav Gallant, the Israeli defence minister, has said Sunday’s announcement – which coincided with a new round of mediated talks for a ceasefire deal in Cairo – did not mean that the war was over. But in another sign of divisions inside Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition, the country’s far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir has said that if Netanyahu decided to end the war without an offensive into Rafah he would not have a mandate to remain as prime minister.
