Recognition of Palestinian statehood is a minority position in Europe but Spain, Ireland and Norway are attempting to begin to shift that balance today. The three European countries have co-ordinated this move, which was announced last week in a rapid succession of announcements and will be formally confirmed by today. They have said the move is not designed to be anti-Israel, but rather a step towards a two-state solution and stability in the region. In practice, it means they join almost all of Latin America, Africa, Asia and the Middle East by formally enshrining their position that the Palestinian territories constitute a state. The move puts them at odds with the vast majority of Europe, where there is broad, long-standing political support for a two-state solution - which would see Israel peacefully co-exist alongside a Palestinian state - but where actual recognition is limited. Spainâ€™s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is due to speak this morning and there will be a debate in the Irish parliament, where the Palestinian flag is due to be flown. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
