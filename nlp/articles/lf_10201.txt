A missile launched from a rebel-controlled area of Yemen has hit a cargo ship in the Red Sea. The extent of the damage caused is not yet known but the projectile is said to have caused a fire on the deck of the ship, which is reported to be German-owned. Yemen's Iran-backed Houthis have been attacking vessels in Red Sea shipping lanes since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza over two months ago, in a campaign they say aims to support the Palestinians. US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke about the attacks at his press conference in Tel Aviv earlier, describing the Houthi rebels as a "threat to freedom of navigation to commercial shipping" and added that international partners were working to deal with the threat. US, French and British warships are patrolling the area and have shot down several missiles fired at ships. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
