 F-N-S-T-A-R-T. 10761 F-N-E-N-D.  D-A-T-E-S-T-A-R-T. 2024-01-26 D-A-T-E-E-N-D.  T-I-T-L-E-S-T-A-R-T. Court has jurisdiction to consider case, judge says. T-I-T-L-E-E-N-D.  T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Donoghue continues on the issue of whether the court has jurisdiction in this case - essentially whether it can make orders. In particular, she is looking at whether there is a dispute between South Africa and Israel, and is setting out the legal framework the court is applying to it. She notes that South Africa has previously made public comments suggesting that Israel may have acted contrary to its obligations under the genocide convention. She further notes Israel has dismissed any notion of genocide in Gaza. The parties hold opposite views regarding Israel's obligation, she says. Therefore, there is a dispute between the two parties. South Africa considers Israel to be responsible for genocide in Gaza. The judge says at least some of the acts and omissions appear to fall within the genocide convention. She concludes the court has jurisdiction to consider the case. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
