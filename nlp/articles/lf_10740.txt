The hearing at the International Court of Justice in the Hague has wrapped up, and we're continuing to monitor reaction from around the world. If you're just joining us, here's the latest: The ICJ issued an interim ruling that Israel must take all measures to prevent genocidal acts in Gaza, but stopped short of ordering a ceasefire. The court has issued six provisional measures in South Africa's genocide case against Israel. They include an order for Israel to take measures to ensure humanitarian access. This is an interim ruling, and the court won't rule on South Africa's genocide claims - which Israel strongly denies - for several years. South Africa's foreign minister says the court order " doesn't work" without a ceasefire. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says his country will "continue this war until absolute victory" Riyad al-Maliki, the Palestinian foreign minister, says the judges ruled "in favour of humanity and international law" T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
