The head of the UN's Palestinian aid agency, UNRWA, has been denied entry into Gaza, the organisation says. Philippe Lazzarini is in Cairo, where he was speaking alongside Egyptian foreign minister Sameh Shoukry. Lazzarini said he had intended to go to Rafah on Monday "but I have been informed an hour ago that my entry into Rafah is declined". Shoukry then blamed Israel for the refusal. "You were declined by the Israeli government, refused the entry which is an unprecedented move for a representative at this high position," Shoukry said. Israeli officials are yet to comment. Lazzarini has visited the Gaza Strip four times since the Gaza war began, and on numerous occasions prior to that, an UNRWA spokesperson said. Israel has previously alleged 13 UNWRA staff played a direct or indirect role in the 7 October Hamas attacks. The UN has launched an investigation into UNWRA, but top officials warned the withdrawal of international funding for the agency could could lead to the "collapse of the humanitarian system".
