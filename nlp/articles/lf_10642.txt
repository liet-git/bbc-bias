T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Heavy showers have been affecting Gaza overnight making conditions for those living under canvas even more challenging. The showers have been caused by a trough from north-east Africa moving across the eastern Mediterranean. This has pushed cool air over the warm seas, with sea temperatures still in the low 20s - the atmosphere becomes unstable with rising air creating showers and thunderstorms. The amount of rain will have varied greatly from place to place. Further showers will continue to affect Gaza throughout the day today. A ridge of high pressure will then bring dry weather, with temperatures well above average by Friday; with this warm weather lasting well into next week. It looks like there will be another round of wet weather towards the end of next week. Gaza gets the vast majority of its annual rainfall between November and February, so there will be many more spells of cool and wet weather to come in the weeks and months ahead. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
