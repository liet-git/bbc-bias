A few weeks ago, as the first group of Israeli hostages were being brought out of Gaza, Avi Shamriz was sitting with his family at their temporary home in a hotel near Tel Aviv. Avi knew that his 26-year-old son, Alon, would not be coming out this time. But the exchange had given him a renewed sense of hope. "On one hand, I am happy that this has begun, because it might continue," he said. On the other hand, Avi was worrying constantly about Israel’s military campaign in Gaza. "The government say they are being careful, but you cannot be careful when you are dropping bombs," he said. "You just don't know who you are going to hit. " On Friday, it emerged that Avi’s worst fears had materialised: Alon was among three hostages shot dead by Israeli forces while escaping their Hamas captors. Alon’s absence had already been a “huge loss” to the family, Avi said that day, back when he still had hope. “The connection with our son was daily, not once in a while. Every day he came to visit us. My three sons - they prayed together, played football together. ”. Alon loved football. He supported Argentina’s national team, because his mother came from Argentina. He loved Lionel Messi. He was studying to be a computer engineer. “My son did not deserve this,” Avi said. Avi Shamriz's son Alon, was one of the hostages killed by the IDF on Friday. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
