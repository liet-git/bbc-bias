T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. As we've been reporting on these pages all week, members of the United Nations Security Council have been locked in intense negotiations over a resolution aimed at bringing in some form of ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war. We're now hearing that the UIS says there are "serious and widespread concerns" that the draft resolution put forward by the United Arab Emirates could "actually slow down" the delivery of of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip. The aim of the resolution is to "facilitate and help expand humanitarian assistance getting into Gaza, and we cannot lose sight of that purpose," says Nate Evans, a spokesperson for the US mission to the United Nations, according to Reuters. "We must ensure any resolution helps and doesnâ€™t hurt the situation on the ground," he adds. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
