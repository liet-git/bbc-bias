A young journalist in Gaza, who's been been displaced twice over the last three months and lost 60 members of her family, says the international community has failed them. Aseel Mousa, 26, tells the BBC's Today programme that she is now living in cramped conditions in Rafah after her home further north in Gaza was destroyed. She says her family is surviving on canned food and disease is spreading. "To be honest, I was waiting for the world to stand for its responsibility and I was waiting for the international community to intervene to help Gaza and to stop this genocide. . . actually the whole world has failed. "Gaza and the children of Gaza, while the whole world was celebrating New Year, we were targeted and being killed by Israel. " Attacks continued from both sides over New Year's Eve. Israel closed the year with new strikes on central Gaza, in what Defence Minister Yoav Gallant called an "essential stage" of its mission to destroy Hamas. And from Gaza, at the stroke of midnight, several rockets were fired towards Israel, where they were intercepted. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
