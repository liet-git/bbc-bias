Mother-of-two Ghada al-Kourd is sheltering in Rafah, having been displaced six times in the last four months. Israel has told 100,000 people in certain areas in the eastern part of the city to evacuate. Al-Kourd tells BBC Radio 4's Today programme she is just 15 minutes away from one of those areas but for the moment, she's staying put. “I’m so confused just to be honest. I have no place to go. This was the last place," she says. Israel is directing Palestinians to go to tent cities in Khan Younis and al-Mawasi, but al-Kourd says she does not believe it would be safe to move to those locations. She would be concerned for her health living in a tent in such a crowded place in the heat, she says. Khan Younis has been destroyed, she adds, while she also voices her concern about the risk of air strikes and fighting in other areas of Gaza. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
