Khan Younis is the second largest city in the Gaza Strip and over the weekend, Israeli tanks started to move from the east, after they captured most of the four main villages. Now, the tanks are advancing very slowly and approaching the eastern part of Khan Younis. The area is very complicated because there are huge buildings, shops and a lot of people. There are still hundreds of thousands of people in Khan Younis. This morning, the Israeli army was dropping leaflets asking people in Khan Younis to go west towards the al-Mawasi area - but this is a small area with no infrastructure. Back in Khan Younis, the director of the hospital tells me staff are struggling to cope with the amount of injured people coming. He stresses there are very little medical supplies left in the hospital and they are struggling with the shortage of food, water and fuel. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
