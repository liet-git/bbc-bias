A man has been found guilty of wearing a headband in support of Hamas at a pro-Palestine rally in central London. Khaled Hajsaad, 24, wore the clothing at a pro-Palestine rally in Trafalgar Square on 25 November 2023. The green headband had the "Shahada" written on it in white - the basic statement of the Islamic faith, the court was told. Hajsaad told police the headband was "an item of Saudi Arabia" and the Shahada was a "statement of my faith". He was found guilty, at the City of London Magistrates' Court, of wearing the item "in such a way or in such circumstances as to arouse reasonable suspicion" he was supporting Hamas - an illegal act in the UK where it is designated a terrorist group. District Judge Nina Tempia told the court: "Hamas is the most notable Palestinian group associated with the colour greenâ€¦ He was wearing the headband at the pro-Palestinian march, where there would be no reasons for someone to wear the headband of a Saudi flag. "It clearly did not have the Saudi sword on it. "I find the defendant guilty of the offence. "Judge Tempia added: "I find the harm serious and when it happened, so soon after 7 October, it would have meant significant distress. "Hajsaad, described as an asylum seeker who arrived in the UK a year ago, had previously entered a not guilty plea. He is due to be sentenced on 21 June at Westminster Magistrates' Court.
