The University of Cambridge has condemned an "act of vandalism" after red paint was sprayed on its historic Senate House. Palestine Action said it wanted to reflect the "Palestinian bloodshed". The group has accused the university of "repeatedly" ignoring pleas for dialogue from students and staff and of not taking "meaningful" action against the "atrocities" in Gaza. A university spokesperson previously said it was happy to engage with students. In May, demonstrators set up camp outside King's College and protests took place outside Senate House, where students have graduated since the 18th Century. Palestine Action says it targets "Israel's arms trade in Britain". "The university has additionally refused to engage with escalating disruption which has been pursued in response to their silence," Palestine Action said in its statement. "Cambridge university has failed to take any meaningful action against, or even release a statement opposing, UK [and] US-backed Israeli atrocities in Palestine. "In a short statement, the university said: "We strongly condemn this act of vandalism. "Earlier this year, Prof Bhaskar Vira, pro-vice-chancellor for education at the university, said in a statement that it had been in "ongoing contact" with students impacted by the "tragic events in Gaza and Palestine".
