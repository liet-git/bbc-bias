The second key area of the Israeli operation is the south, and Khan Younis. This morning, about 50 people were killed in the middle and the south of the Gaza Strip. The health ministry, run by Hamas, says it can’t count the number of people killed in the north. Khan Younis is surrounded by Israeli tanks from eastern and northern sides. The tanks are slowly moving towards the Jalal Street, which is one of the main streets that lead to the heart of the city. And now most of the people who were displaced back on 13 October - from the north to Khan Younis - have to leave again to Rafah. People keep talking to me about a map issued by the Israelis, giving warnings to civilians to move. They say they can’t understand the mechanism of this and where they should go. Gaza humanitarian zone not humane, evacuees say. Images published this morning showed buildings in the southern city on fire. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
