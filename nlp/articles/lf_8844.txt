This afternoon's ceasefire vote will be held in the UN Security Council, of which there are five permanent members - the US, the UK, France, Russia and China. The composition reflects the five victorious powers of World War 2, who helped to set up the United Nations. There are another 10 rotating members of the council, currently made up of: Albania, Brazil, Ecuador, Gabon, Ghana, Japan, Malta, Mozambique, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates. But power rests with the five full-time members, who have the ability to veto any resolution that comes before it. The US has already vowed to block today's motion. The veto power has seen the council deadlocked for a decade, with Russia and China tending to cooperate against the US, UK and France. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
