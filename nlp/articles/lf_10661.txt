Itâ€™s just gone 03:20 in Israel and Gaza, and 01:20 here in London. On a live video feed from Gaza we can hear the occasional boom of what seem to be explosions in the distance. A few hours ago, the UN General Assembly overwhelmingly adopted a resolution demanding an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza. The vote is non-binding but analysts say it acts as a powerful measure of international opinion. Though the US was one of just ten countries to vote against the resolution, President Joe Biden said earlier that Israel was losing international support because of its "indiscriminate bombing" of Palestinians. The result of the vote was welcomed by the Palestinian presidency while Hamas said it showed the prevailing international will was in favor of stopping the aggression against the Palestinian people. Israel said a ceasefire would only serve to "prolong Hamas's reign of terror". Damage in Rafah after an Israeli air strike on Tuesday. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
