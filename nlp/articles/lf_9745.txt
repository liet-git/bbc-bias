Getting aid into Gaza is an “incredibly slow” process, Unicef spokesperson Tess Ingram says. There are “many, many checks” at the two crossings in the south - Kerem Shalom and Rafah - and Ingram says she expects the same if Erez opens in the north. She tells BBC 5 Live's Breakfast programme that nothing is put on the aid delivery trucks without pre-approval and everything needs to be cleared. Ingram says the trucks are loaded in a warehouse in Egypt and sent to the crossings, where they are screened for a second time. “In that screening process, everything is unloaded and every box is checked, which makes things incredibly slow," she explains. "Sometimes items are sent back to us with no explanation”. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
