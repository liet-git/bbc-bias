T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. As the war enters its third month, Israeli tanks are advancing to Khan Younis’s city centre, the hometown of Hamas military wing general commander Mohammed Dief, and the movement leader Yahya Sinwar, who Israel believes is the mastermind of October 7 attack. Fighting in the north is focusing on another Hamas stronghold, Jabalia, and the neighbourhoods of Gaza City, Zaytoun, Shejaiya, Al-Daraj, and Al-Tuffah. The war has entered the most important and complex stage, as tanks approach the three most important Hamas strongholds (Khan Younis, Jabalia, and Shuja’iya). Many believe that Hamas has more military strength there and will be more able to confront the Israeli troops in their strongholds. Hundreds of thousands of civilians are still living in those areas, and the possibility of more civilian casualties is very high. The humanitarian situation is a catastrophe. Most basic goods are not available and most water consumed is not drinking water. Neven Hassan, a mother of five, told me: “We eat one meal a day - mostly a small piece of bread and canned beans. "I can’t find milk for my six-month-old baby, all my daughters and my son are sick, they drink unclean water and we can’t find any blankets to cope with the cold weather. " She said the sharp drop in temperatures makes it harder, as the majority of the population lives in primitive tents and does not have suitable clothing or adequate shelter. Palestinian children carry items as they walk at the site of Israeli strikes in Khan Younis. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
