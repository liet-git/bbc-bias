Teenager Tariq Qudeih in the Gazan city of Khan Younis has told Reuters news agency about the moment a strike hit a house in the street he was standing in. "Glass fell on us, and a lot of people were wounded," he says. "People were screaming and you could no longer tell what was happening around you. " Many of the injured were taken to the Nasser hospital in the city, including a baby girl whose father said she was injured when a rocket hit the house she was sleeping in. Hisham Shbeir told Reuters he thought they were in an area that was "classified as safe". The IDF has identified areas people should leave for their own safety, including parts of the city of Khan Younis. But Gazans have reported confusion over which places civilians can go to escape the fighting, and some have struggled to access evacuation maps online because of difficulties with internet connectivity. The Hamas-run health ministry says dozens of people have been killed across Gaza in the past 24 hours. Tariq Qudeih was outside when a strike hit a house in Khan Younis. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
