UK Defence Secretary Grant Shapps has said more aid needs to reach Gaza. He said: "It seems to me that what the world needs to do is get a lot more aid to people who are, in many cases, innocent in this. " Shapps is in the West Bank to offer UK supplies via a sea route into Gaza, although he agreed that, at this stage, they are studying options for routes in. In response to the UN secretary generalâ€™s call for a ceasefire, he said that the problem is that Israel would still end up living next door to an organisation that wants to murder all Jewish and Israeli citizens in the world. The best thing, he said, would be for all the hostages to be released. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
