The sun is just beginning to come up over LA and it appears the protest area at UCLA has been largely emptied. The barricades around the centre of campus have been mostly dismantled and tents are starting to be removed. We're still waiting to hear from the LAPD about how long they expect the operation to last and how many arrests there have been. Our correspondent at the scene says buses have been brought to the campus to transport detained protesters. There are still some demonstrators around UCLA but it looks like the protest has been largely broken up. We'll bring you official confirmation of arrests as soon as we get it. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
