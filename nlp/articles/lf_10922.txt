T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. In a statement marking the six-month anniversary of the Hamas attacks, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak says he supports Israel’s right to defend itself but adds the UK has been “shocked” by the bloodshed of the war and the deaths of British aid workers. “We continue to stand by Israel’s right to defeat the threat from Hamas terrorists and defend their security," he says. “But the whole of the UK is shocked by the bloodshed, and appalled by the killing of brave British heroes who were bringing food to those in need. " “This terrible conflict must end. The hostages must be released. The aid – which we have been straining every sinew to deliver by land, air and sea – must be flooded in. “The children of Gaza need a humanitarian pause immediately, leading to a long-term sustainable ceasefire. That is the fastest way to get hostages out and aid in and to stop the fighting and loss of life. “For the good of both Israelis and Palestinians - who all deserve to live in peace, dignity and security - that is what we will keep working to achieve. ”. Rishi Sunak has defended Israel’s right to self defence. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
