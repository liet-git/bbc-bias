T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Unicef spokesman James Elder tells BBC Radio 4's Today programme it would not be possible to keep people safe while a ground invasion on Rafah took place. He says it is unrealistic to think that the people who have been sheltering there could move. "You really have either rubble. . . or the beach - and as a Palestinian friend said living on a beach is accepting you are going to die. " Elder says ahead of such an offensive , aid organisations would generally pre-position aid in preparation but it is not possible because there is nowhere to do so, as warehouses have been destroyed and it is "not ethical to pre-position aid when there are people round the corner that definitely need that aid today". While more aid has been getting into Gaza recently he says it is "simply not enough". "We must look to intent. If there was discussion about really keeping people safe as hostilities continued we wouldn’t see one toilet for 900 people in Rafah, one shower for 3,500 people, we wouldn’t see these restrictions on aid," he says. "We might see these hostilities but we’d see people at least not being killed on the ground from disease and lack of water as they are from the sky. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
