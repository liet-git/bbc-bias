Away from Lebanon, let's take a look at the situation on the ground in Gaza. Yesterday, the Palestinian Red Crescent reported that five people had been killed, and three injured, after the Israeli military bombed its headquarters in Khan Younis, a city in the south of the Gaza Strip. The humanitarian organisation said Israel's forces had targeted the eighth floor of its HQ. It also said drones had fired in the vicinity of the neighbouring Al-Amal hospital. We'll bring you more on this as and when we learn it today. Elsewhere, Israel said its troops had killed "dozens of terrorists" in Jabalia, in northern Gaza, and targeted others in Gaza City. Troops seized weapons and dismantled rocket launchers, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) added. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
