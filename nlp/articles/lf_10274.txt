T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. There's been a defiant response from a member of the Israeli parliament (Knesset) over international criticism of the war in Gaza. Sharren Haskel, from the centre-right National Unity Party, told the BBC it was essential for Israel to stick to its aim of eradicating Hamas. "Their leadership have said time and time again that they will always persecute the Jews and try to murder them if they have any kind of opportunity, they will try to do the massacre that they did on 7 October over and over again and so this war is an actual war on humanity. "I mean, this is the only way that we can defend our children and make sure that they can live here peacefully in Israel. " It follows comments from US President Joe Biden who said Israel is starting to lose global support over its "indiscriminate bombing" of Gaza and overwhelming support for a ceasefire during a vote in the UN General Assembly.
