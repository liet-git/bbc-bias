T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. While we're looking back on today's programme, let's bring you another question put to Foreign Secretary David Cameron earlier, who was asked about claims by Hamas that a British-Israeli hostage has died in Gaza . Hamas, proscribed as a terrorist group by the UK government, claims Nadav Popplewell died of wounds sustained in an Israeli airstrike more than a month ago. Popplewell, 51, was seized with his mother Channah Peri on 7 October when fighters crossed the border fence and launched deadly attacks in Israel. The Israeli military is yet to comment. In a brief statement via the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, Popplewell's family asked media organisations not to publish footage of him released by Hamas on Saturday, which shows him in captivity with a black eye. Cameron said that he couldn't give any new updates this morning, adding: "We are trying to work out what has happened, we don't want to say anything before we get better information. " He said that he met with Popplewell's family on previous occasions. "When you see what Hamas are prepared to do you just realise the terrible, dreadful, inhuman people we are dealing with," Cameron added. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
