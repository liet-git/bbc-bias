T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. The debate continues for another half an hour and Liberal Democrat Richard Foord says he will vote for the motions calling for an immediate ceasefire. He says being a friend of Israel involves being listened to, and that is not happening to the British government at the moment. Noting that Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron had suggested the UK might recognise a Palestinian state, Foord observes that was "utterly rebuffed" by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He adds that Hamas terrorists sought to provoke an "excessive response", which in turn will provoke future retribution as another Palestinian generation mourns its dead and is attracted to the very Islamism that Israel is trying to destroy along with Hamas. Foord accuses Israel of a lack of proportionality and failing to limit its military objectives. He quotes a constituent, a former senior British ambassador, as saying the UK response has been "ineffectual, morally indefensible" and also "hugely damaging" to British interests. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
