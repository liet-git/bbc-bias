Yesterdayâ€™s vote in the House of Commons came as Israel threatens to extend its ground operation into the city of Rafah , defying international opposition. More than a million displaced Palestinians, who represent about half of Gaza's population, are sheltering in the southern Gaza city , having fled fighting in the north earlier on in the conflict. There were reports of more Israeli air strikes on Rafah on Thursday. The White House coordinator for the Middle East, Brett McGurk, is due to arrive in Israel today, as the US continues efforts to secure a truce and hostage deal . Israeli police say one person was killed and five others injured after three Palestinians opened fire at motorists near an Israeli checkpoint in the occupied West Bank near Jerusalem. On Tuesday, the US vetoed an Algerian-proposed resolution at the UN demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. In its own draft resolution, urging a temporary ceasefire, the US warned Israel not to invade Rafah. Israel launched its operations in Gaza following an attack by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and more than 240 others taken hostage . The Israeli military campaign has killed 29,000 people in the Palestinian territory , according to the Hamas-run health ministry there.
