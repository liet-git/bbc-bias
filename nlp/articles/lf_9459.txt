A cargo ship carrying 240 tonnes of food meant for Gaza has returned to Cyprus, after Israeli air strikes killed seven World Central Kitchen aid workers. The undelivered aid was part of a 340 tonne consignment sent from Cyprus on 30 March for the desperate Palestinians in Gaza, which the UN says is on the brink of famine. The aid workers from WCK had just finished unloading 100 tonnes of aid from a barge - also sent from Cyprus - when they were killed on Monday night. Their killing has prompted the WCK - which had been active in Gaza since October - and other aid groups to suspend their operations in the Palestinian enclave. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
