One of the main differences between the SNP proposal on Israel-Gaza and the government's amendment is how they are framing an end to fighting. The Scottish National Party are calling for an "immediate ceasefire" - a term Labour also use in their amendment - while the government is proposing an "immediate humanitarian pause". All parties want an end to fighting for now to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza - the UN has been warning of famine in the territory since December. But they are disagreeing over how long that end to fighting should last. The government is stressing in its  amendment that it supports Israel's right to defend itself and recover its hostages, which may require further military action. Earlier Sunak said calling for an "immediate ceasefire" now was "not in anyone's interest" as it could collapse in days or weeks. Instead, he said, the government was calling for an "immediate humanitarian pause" to allow hostages out and aid into Gaza, and was working towards a "sustainable" ceasefire in the longer term. The World Food Programme has said "food and safe water have become incredibly scarce" in Northern Gaza. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
