Lib Dem MP Layla Moran asks for more to be told to the House about sanctions imposed on four "extremist" Israeli settlers the UK has accused of attacking Palestinians in the occupied West Bank. "They are working," she adds. Moran also asks what more was said to Prime Minister Netanyahu about the possible future Palestinian state “because that is a necessary precondition for any kind of ceasefire”. Mitchell replies that the UK foreign secretary and the prime minister have both been very clear on the importance of a Palestinian state. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
