More pictures have emerged on Israeli social media, showing Palestinians apparently surrendering to Israeli forces in the northern Gaza Strip. For the first time, the images show a man obeying instructions to lay down a weapon. But the existence of two versions of the same scene have raised questions about its authenticity. In one version, the man, dressed only in shorts and sandals, holds a rifle aloft in his right hand and a magazine in his left . He places both down on a rubbish-strewn pavement, next to another discarded weapon. But in a second version, the same man appears with the rifle in his left hand and the magazine in his right. In both versions, dozens of other men are seen standing across the road, stripped to their shorts, many of them with their arms aloft.   They appear to be standing in front of a UN school in Beit Lahiya, north of the Jabaliya refugee camp. It’s not clear why two versions of the same video were filmed - the BBC has approached the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for comment. But it does suggest that troops may have staged the scene to drive home the message that Palestinian gunmen are surrendering - something Israeli officials have claimed. In a separate video circulating on Israeli social media, soldiers are seen taking delight in destroying Palestinian property.  A soldier gleefully vandalises the contents of a shop, while a laughing colleague films. In a statement on this video, the Israeli military said it condemned the soldier’s behaviour, calling it “inappropriate and contrary to the values of the IDF. ”. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
