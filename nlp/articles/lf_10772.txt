Israel's national carrier El Al has this morning said it will suspend flights to Johannesburg from March due to what it says is a drop in demand in the wake of South Africa's case against Israel at the International Court of Justice. "Israelis don't want to fly to South Africa," a spokeswoman for the airline said. El Al currently has up to two non-stop flights to Johannesburg a week. "They are cancelling flights and planes are pretty empty. . . We understand it's the situation because it was different before," the spokeswoman added. "The fact that the Israelis don't want to go to South Africa but do want to go to other places helps us decide that we're pausing that route," she said. The company also cited the current security situation. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
