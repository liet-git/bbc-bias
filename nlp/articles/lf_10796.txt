As the Israeli military advances across Gaza, saying it is targeting areas described as Hamas strongholds, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has described the moment as the “beginning of the end” of the group, without providing evidence of that. Netanyahu has repeatedly said the goal of the war is to eliminate Hamas - Israeli authorities say around 7,000 members have been killed so far – and to secure the release of more than 130 people who remain in captivity, after being kidnapped in the 7 October attacks. Over the weekend, Israeli media reported that officials believed intense operations in Gaza were likely to continue for two more months. It is not clear whether Israel will have all that time. Probably not. Large numbers of Palestinians are being killed every day while the severe humanitarian crisis is quickly worsening. Aid agencies warn that those who have not been killed by bombs may not survive hunger and disease. Israel is already under international pressure to do more to protect civilians - even from the US, its main ally. Calls for a ceasefire will, at some point, become too loud to be ignored. Israel will be able to dismantle Hamas’s infrastructure across Gaza, but the group’s ideology is likely to resist. Amid images of widespread destruction and suffering, Qatar’s Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani has given a warning: the war risks radicalising an entire generation across the Middle East.
