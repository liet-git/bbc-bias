The IDF has given more details on how it mistakenly killed three hostages in Gaza on Friday. An IDF official says one of its soldiers saw the hostages emerging from a building without shirts on, holding a stick with a white cloth on it. The soldier felt threatened and opened fire, declaring that the men were terrorists, the IDF official says. Two hostages were killed immediately and one was injured, and ran back into the building. Then soldiers heard a cry for help in Hebrew, "and immediately the battalion commander issued a ceasefire order", the official adds. Alon Shamriz, Yotam Haim and Samer Talalka were mistakenly killed by the IDF. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
