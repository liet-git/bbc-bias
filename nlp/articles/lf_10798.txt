T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Daniel Hagari, a spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), has given an update on its operations in Gaza, saying its military have been "intensifying" attacks on Hamas strongholds in the Gaza Strip. He said the IDF will focus on locating Hamas strongholds in Khan Younis, and will continue to "apply military pressure until they dismantle Hamasâ€™s infrastructure" in the city. The Israeli military has issued evacuation orders in the central part of Khan Younis in Gaza's south, urging civilians to move closer to the Egyptian border. Hagari said more than 500 members of Hamas and Islamic Jihad groups have been arrested across the Gaza Strip in the last month, 140 of whom were arrested after the seven-day-long truce ended. He echoed earlier comments from Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu, and said that some Hamas operatives have been surrendering. "We arrest those who need to be arrested and release those who are not terrorists, removing them from the area southward to areas where civilians can stay," Hagari said. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
