Member states of the World Health Organization (WHO) have passed a resolution calling for immediate medical access to Gaza. In an unusual move, the WHO’s executive board met in emergency session to discuss what its director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned was a health catastrophe - with many wounded, and high risk of disease. The resolution calls for immediate unimpeded access for aid, and for those fighting to abide by international law. That means no attacks on hospitals or health workers. It also demands that all those detained – hostages and Palestinians – should have access to medical care. The WHO has warned that the terms of the resolution will be virtually impossible to fulfil without a ceasefire, something the United States vetoed at the UN Security Council on Friday. Earlier Ghebreyesus said "the impact of the conflict on health is catastrophic", adding that "Gaza's health system is on its knees and collapsing". 'Nowhere and no-one is safe in Gaza' - WHO chief.
