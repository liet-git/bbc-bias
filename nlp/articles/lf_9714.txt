T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell says the Israeli government is not doing enough "to prevent starvation in Gaza". He was commenting on Israel's recent announcement to reopen the Erez crossing in northern Gaza and allow temporary use of Ashdod port in southern Israel. That decision followed a call between US President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. "The binding UN Security Council Resolution 2728 must be implemented. Now," he adds, highlighting the resolution passed last month. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
