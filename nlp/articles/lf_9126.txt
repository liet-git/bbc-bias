In Lebanon, the Iran-backed Hezbollah group has said four more of its members have been killed in what state media says was an Israeli air strike in the village of Naqoura. Hezbollah's Al-Manar TV station carried a tribute to the four - who they described as "martyrs" and said included local official Hussein Yazbek - in a brief statement issued late last night. Lebanon's state-run National News Agency said Israeli aircraft had bombed a three-storey house, destroying it completely. The attack also injured nine civilians, it reported. The Times of Israel said the total number of Hezbollah members to have been killed since the war began in October now stands at more than 150.  Israel and Hezbollah have been exchanging near daily fire across Lebanon's southern border for months. Israel has not confirmed it was responsible for this strike. Last night, the Israeli military posted a video to social media, which it said showed it attacking "targets of the terrorist organisation Hezbollah in Lebanese territory". The footage shows various buildings being struck, followed by huge blasts and smoke rising. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
