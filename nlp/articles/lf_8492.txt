T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Hundreds of protestors gathered in Tel Aviv last night, following the news that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) had "mistakenly" killed three men who were being held hostage in Gaza. The protestors carried placards and candles as they marched to a military base in Tel Aviv and called on the Israeli government to negotiate a deal for the release of the remaining hostages captured by Hamas on 7 October. Yotam Haim, Samer Talalka, and Alon Shamriz were shot by troops as they were mis-identified as a "threat", during the IDF's continuing ground offensive in northern Gaza. The IDF has expressed "deep remorse" over the killings and has said it will launch an investigation. More than 100 hostages abducted by Hamas remain in Gaza. The protestors marched in Tel Aviv to an IDF military base. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
