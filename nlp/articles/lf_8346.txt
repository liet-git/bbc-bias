More now on the situation in northern Gaza, which now lacks a functional hospital, according to the World Health Organization. Hospitals in the north of the territory have become "hospices" where people are "waiting to die", according to the WHO’s team leader Sean Casey after a recent visit. There is no surgical capacity left in the north, Casey said, meaning patients with serious injuries would die of wound infections. He stressed the severe shortages of food and water, describing meeting people with severe untreated injuries who had begged him not for medicines, but for water. Dr Richard Peeperkorn, the WHO’s representative in Gaza, said he would like to see many more patients evacuated out of Gaza for treatment in Egypt or other countries. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
