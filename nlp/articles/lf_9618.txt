Israel is facing a renewed call to allow international journalists into Gaza. In an open letter, the Foreign Press Association (FPA) said it was "alarmed that six months into the Israel-Hamas war, Israel continues to bar international reporters from entering any part of the Gaza Strip independently". Since the 7 October attacks, civilian access to Gaza has been blocked, and almost the only journalists able to enter the territory have been those embedded with the Israeli military. Palestinian journalists and media workers have reported from inside Gaza since the start of the war, but dozens have been killed, injured or gone missing, and they have been hampered by the conditions in the Strip. The FPA said the "blanket ban has limited the world's ability to witness the true cost of the war to all sides" and raised "questions about what Israel does not want international journalists to see‚Äù. The association previously filed a petition to Israel's Supreme Court requesting immediate access for international media to Gaza, but in January the court rejected the petition, saying the restrictions were justified on security grounds. "The decision whether to be on the ground in Gaza should be up to each individual international media outlet," the FPA said today. "Six months is far too long. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
