One of the world's biggest shipping firms, the German company Hapag-Lloyd, has told the BBC it will avoid the Red Sea for at least another week and then reassess following the recent attacks by Houthi rebels in Yemen. The Iran-backed rebels, who have declared their support for Hamas, have been targeting vessels on the popular shipping route through the Suez Canal. The group has previously claimed its attacks are directed at vessels linked to Israel, in response to the war in Gaza. Shipping companies are worried about the safety of their staff as some vessels have come under attack from drones and rockets. The US Navy destroyed three Houthi "small boats" on the weekend, when their crews attempted to board a container ship in the Red Sea. Hapag-Lloyd sends 50 ships every month through the Suez Canal and will have to divert around the Cape of Good Hope which will increase journey times by one or two weeks, depending on the destination.
