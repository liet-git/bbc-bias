We're hearing more now from people in al-Mawasi, which, as we mentioned in our last post, is a small area on the southern coast of Gaza where a blast has reportedly killed at least 14 Palestinians - and which Israel has previously promoted as a safe area. One man describes being asleep in a camp of tents when the blast occurred - he says he later found a body that "flew 40 metres away" as a result of the explosion. "Where is the humanity?" Jamal Hamad Salah says to Reuters, asking: "Where is the European democracy and the Muslim community, where are the Arabs and where are the Muslims?" Mahmoud Saleh , the uncle of one of those killed in the attack, expresses anger at the international community for not doing enough: Where is international law? There is no law. They killed children. Children, they are getting shelled as they are sleeping, they are bombing them, killing them. " And Bahaa Abu Hatab , whose brother died in the blast, adds that nowhere in Gaza is safe. "Wherever you go, there are strikes," he tells the news agency. "In the country, next to the camps, in al-Mawasi. There is no safe space. " The Israeli military says it is targeting Hamas fighters, not civilians. The BBC has approached it for comment on this incident. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
