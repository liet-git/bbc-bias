First up in the studio is the foreign secretary who is asked by Laura about the ongoing conflict in the Gaza Strip as she cites the UN chief in the last hour reiterating calls for an immediate ceasefire. Laura says President Joe Biden has said if Israel goes into Rafah "I am not supplying weapons" - as she asks David Cameron if the UK will say the same.
