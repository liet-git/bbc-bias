T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. As we reported earlier, the EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has accused Israel of "provoking famine" in Gaza. Responding on social media, Israeli foreign minister Israel Katz insists his country "allows extensive humanitarian aid into Gaza by land, air, and sea for anyone willing to help. Despite Hamas violently disrupting aid convoys". He says it's time for Borrell "to stop attacking Israel and recognise our right to self-defence against Hamas' crimes". T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
