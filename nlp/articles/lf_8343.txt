T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. As we've been reporting, negotiations are continuing to try to secure a unanimous UN Security Council vote on a ceasefire in Gaza - due later today in New York. But a former senior British diplomat has said it will be difficult for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to agree to suspend hostilities with Hamas. “He wants to completely eliminate Hamas as a military threat, as a political organisation, Mark Lyall Grant, who was the UK’s ambassador to the UN from 2009 to 2015, told BBC Radio 5 Live. "He wants to get all the hostages released and he wants to kill the Hamas leadership in Gaza. " Lyall Grant believes Netanyahu will be reluctant to a agree to a new truce "until he’s achieved more of those objectives". He points out that all UN Security Council's resolutions are legally binding, but not legally enforceable: "It’s possible that Netanyahu could ignore it, even if America had voted in favour of the resolution.
