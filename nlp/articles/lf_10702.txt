T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. A senior Palestinian official familiar with the ceasefire negotiations has said that Qatari and Egyptian mediators are exploring "contacts and initiatives. . . that do not rise to the level of negotiations" but test the water. Qatar hosted talks leading to a week-long pause in fighting at the end of November. But negotiations had broken down, with Israel bringing home its negotiation team. A senior Hamas official has told the BBC there is no negotiation at this time and they will not release hostages before a "cessation of aggression" by Israel. "Contacts with mediators are continuing, but there is no negotiation at this time, but we informed all parties that Hamas is ready to negotiate on the basis of a comprehensive agreement that guarantees the immediate stop of aggression," the official continued. "We are certain that Israel will be forced to accept a ceasefire because it cannot liberate the prisoners by force. " On Sunday, Qatar's prime minister said they were "not going to give up", but were "not seeing the same willingness from both parties". Qatar helped mediate a week-long pause in fighting.
