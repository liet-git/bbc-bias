The prime minister has two main aims in giving his statement in the House of Commons. One is to condemn Iran’s attack on Israel and to explain the UK’s strategy in agreeing to shoot down Iranian drones. The other is to call for restraint as Israel considers retaliation. There is a nervousness in government as Westminster watches for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s next move. Political opposition to the UK’s military involvement this weekend is fairly muted. Labour and the Scottish National Party have asked Rishi Sunak to back an immediate ceasefire in Gaza as a way to reduce tensions in the region. The Liberal Democrats’ leader Ed Davey agreed with those calls and has previously said there should be a retrospective vote on the military action (although he said the Lib Dems would support it). However, we are expecting George Galloway - the left-wing firebrand MP recently elected in Rochdale - to speak in response to Sunak’s statement. He has a track record of criticising Western military action in the Middle East. So while political opposition may be muted, it won’t be entirely absent and Sunak will have to defend his decision to authorise the RAF to shoot down Iranian drones. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
