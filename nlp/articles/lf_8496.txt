T-I-T-L-E-E-N-D.  T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Egypt is refusing to co-ordinate with Israel on humanitarian aid entries into Gaza through the Rafah crossing, according to Egypt's state-affiliated Al Qahera TV network. The reason for refusal is "Israel's unacceptable escalation,"  Al Qahera TV reports, citing a senior official. The Rafah crossing, which lies between Egypt and Gaza, was the only crossing into Gaza which has not been directly controlled by Israel - until the Israeli military said its troops had taken "operational control" of the Palestinian side of the crossing earlier this week.
