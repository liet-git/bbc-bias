The World Health Organization (WHO) says Gaza's largest hospital al-Shifa has been reduced to ashes by Israel's latest siege, leaving what it describes as an "empty shell" with many bodies. The head of WHO Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has been posting on social media and says a team, who were visiting the site on Friday, have seen "at least five dead bodies during the mission". Even restoring minimal functionality in the short term seems implausible. " Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. The WHO chief goes on to say an "in-depth assessment by a team of engineers is needed" to work out "if the remaining buildings are safe for future use". "WHO and partners’ recent effort to support the revival of basic services at Al-Shifa are now lost, and people are once again deprived of access to lifesaving health care services," he adds. Dr Tedros also reiterates international calls for a ceasefire and the protection of what is left of the medical facilities in Gaza. During a raid of the hospital last month, the IDF said it killed 200 "terrorists", including a senior commander of Hamas's internal security force, while in November, the IDF said it had found tunnels used by Hamas underneath al-Shifa. Correction 17 April: This post originally reported that the IDF said it killed 20 “terrorists” in a raid of al-Shifa hospital last month, and has been amended to make clear the number was 200.
