As British MPs attempted to vote on a Gaza ceasefire, banking sharply over the Mediterranean sea, in two passes, the royal Jordanian airforce Hercules dropped the four tons of British aid directly into northern Gaza, just after sunset. The pallets, fitted with parachutes and GPS trackers were bound for an area just to the north of a Jordanian army field hospital in Gaza City. The UK has until now only sent aid to Gaza by land and sea. But northern Gaza, a wasteland after nearly five months of war, is impossible to reach. The World Food Programme has suspended deliveries there because its convoys had endured “complete chaos and violence” it said. There’s a heavy Israeli military presence there. Much of the population were forced south. But still, an estimated 300,000 Palestinians remain, with little food or water. The UN has been warning for months of a looming famine in the north. The British Jordanian delivery contained diesel, critical medical equipment, and ration packs for patients and medical staff. As the last pallet sailed into the night sky, the Jordanian air crew saluted. It landed right on target, they said. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
