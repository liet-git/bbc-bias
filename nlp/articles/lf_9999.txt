T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Now Cameron is asked about the Israeli attack on the Iranian consulate Damascus on 1 April, which Iran says caused it to retaliate. The foreign secretary says from their perspective, the Iran's Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) are "arranging Hamas's attacks on Israel". Cameron says the response directly from Iran into Israel "is of a different order, and that's why I think it was right for us to take the decisions" that the UK and the US made. Context : Iran launched around 300 drones, cruise and ballistic missiles from its own territory at Israel's.
