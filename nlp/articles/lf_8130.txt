As my colleague was saying, today's scenes in the Houses of Parliament were extraordinary. Central Lobby, a few metres outside the entrance to the House of Commons, was packed full of camera crews and journalists, all trying to work out what was going on. We could see as Conservative MPs and SNP MPs filed out into members' lobby in protest at the Speaker of the House of Commons. Sir Lindsay Hoyle then returned to the House of Commons to apologise. “I regret how it ended up,” he said. It is a significant moment for Sir Lindsay Hoyle. He appeared emotional as he left the Chair after his statement. The wrangling over procedure continued. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
