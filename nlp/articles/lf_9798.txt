The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) posted a video message to social media early this morning to confirm it was responding to "concrete intelligence which demanded immediate action". IDF chief spokesperson Rear Adm Daniel Hagari said "senior Hamas terrorists” had “regrouped" inside the hospital. He said the IDF would ensure the hospital continued its functions while the military conducted its operation. While Hagari said patients and medical staff would not be forced to evacuate, the Israeli military has since changed their position, with army spokesman Avichay Adraee giving immediate evacuation orders earlier this morning.
