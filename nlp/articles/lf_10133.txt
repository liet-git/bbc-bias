The BBC's Rushdi Abualouf, who has reported from Gaza for decades, spoke about the difficulties for journalists reporting from the area. Earlier on the BBC News Channel he said: "The consequence for the journalist is huge. People see the correspondent behind the camera and they believe that he is a hero but in the end he is a human and he has a family to look after. "He always has fear about his family, imagine somebody is losing five of his family members. He believes that he should continue to do the story but all of his sadness and grief inside him is very difficult to keep reporting. " Correction 30 January: This post originally said hundreds of journalists are reported to have been killed during the conflict since 7 October. A recent article from the Committee to Protect Journalists put the figure at "at least 83 journalists and media workers" - as there are no reliable estimates which report a figure of hundreds, we have removed this sentence from the post.
