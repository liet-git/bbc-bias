Benjamin Netanyahu said Israeli forces had acted "creatively and bravely" to bring home the hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. "We will not let up until we complete the mission and return home all the hostages - both those alive and dead," the Israeli prime minister says. The operation is the most successful rescue of hostages by the Israeli military in this war and could alleviate some of the pressure Netanyahu has been facing to reach a ceasefire deal and secure the release of more hostages. Following the operation, Israeli war cabinet minister Benny Gantz postponed a statement he was due to make on Saturday in which he was widely expected to announce his resignation from the government.
