UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres says an agreement between Israel and Hamas is essential to put an end to the "suffering of Palestinians and Israeli hostages in Gaza". He says this is a "decisive moment" for the "fate of the entire region". I reiterate my appeal for both parties to show political courage and spare no effort to secure an agreement now. To stop the bloodshed, to free the hostages. "I'm disturbed and distressed by the renewed military activity in Rafah by the Israeli Defense Forces. " He adds that the closure of both the Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings are especially damaging to an already dire humanitarian situation, and calls for them to reopen immediately. "Just to give an example, we risk running out of fuel this evening," he says. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
