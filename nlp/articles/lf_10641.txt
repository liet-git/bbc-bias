T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Israel's army say that 10 soldiers were killed in fighting in northern Gaza yesterday making it the deadliest day for the military since its ground offensive against Hamas began. Nine of those killed – including a battalion commander and colonel – had been fighting in Shejaiya, to the east of Gaza City. It is reported that they fell victim to a coordinated ambush. A total of 115 soldiers have been killed so far. On X, Benny Gantz, a member of the Israeli War Cabinet, who is also a former military chief of staff, wrote that the war was exacting “a heavy, painful and difficult price” . While overall the majority of Israelis continue to see the war as justified and necessary, the death of soldiers in a society where most Jewish citizens - and some from other religious denominations - serve in the conscript army resonates deeply. On social media, some Israelis are questioning whether the escalation in ground combat could be linked to US pressure to reduce the intensity of air strikes. Aerial bombardment is less deadly for Israeli forces but has caused large numbers of Palestinian civilian casualties. Israeli soldiers pictured near the border with Gaza. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
