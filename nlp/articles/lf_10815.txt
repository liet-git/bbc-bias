We've just received some updated casualty figures from the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. It says 18,205 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since 7 October, with a further 49,645 people injured. The health ministry said in early December that about 70% of the casualties were women and children, but has not given a detailed breakdown in recent days. Unicef says that, up to 6 December, more than 5,350 children had been reported killed, since Israel began its military campaign in response to the 7 October attacks in which around 1,200 people were killed in Israel. As we reported earlier , more than 100 Israeli soldiers have been killed since the Israel Defense Forces began ground operations in Gaza. As a reminder, here is how the number of people who have died in Gaza are counted. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
