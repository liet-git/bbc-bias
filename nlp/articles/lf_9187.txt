An Israeli missile reportedly hit Iran overnight, six days after Tehran's unprecedented attack on Israeli territory last weekend. Here's what we know so far: An Israeli missile has hit Iran, US officials have told the BBC's partner station CBS News, with explosions heard around the central city of Isfahan early Friday morning, Iranian media reports. Iranian media say three drones were destroyed after the country's air defence systems were activated. They cite an army general in Isfahan province as saying that no damage has been reported. Isfahan province is home to a large airbase, a major missile production complex and several nuclear facilities. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has said no nuclear sites were damaged. The Pentagon and Israel's military have both declined to comment so far. Some background. Iran has been on high alert after Israel said it would respond to an Iranian attack against it on Saturday night. Iran launched more than 300 missiles and drones towards Israel on 13 April in an unprecedented attack. Israel and Western allies were able to down most of them before they reached Israeli territory. Tehran has maintained this attack was in response to a suspected Israeli strike on its Syria consulate which killed 13 people. Israel had indicated that it would hit back though international leaders have been urging the country to show restraint. Several US media outlets reported that Washington had received advanced notice of Israel's strikes. BBC Persian sent footage of Isfahan explosions. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
