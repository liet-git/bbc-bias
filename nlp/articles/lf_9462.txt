The UN is suspending its overnight operations in Gaza for at least 48 hours, "to evaluate security", spokesperson St√©phane Dujarric says. He adds that he is aware the move will have a "real impact" on those dependent on aid. "UNRWA is the backbone of our humanitarian organisation," he says. Dujarric does not provide specifics about when the suspension will begin or what it will entail, but confirms that other agencies will continue to be working in the area at night. UN teams, he adds, are still working to assist victims of the recent al-Shifa hospital raid. Trucks carrying aid to Gaza residents cross over the Rafah border. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
