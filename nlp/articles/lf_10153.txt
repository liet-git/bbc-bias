T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. The World Health Organization (WHO) has cancelled another mission to transport medial supplies to northern Gaza after failing to be given security guarantees. It is the fourth mission aiming to bring urgent supplies to the al-Awda Hospital and a key pharmacy that has been cancelled since 26 December, a statement from the UN's global health body says. The WHO adds it has been 12 days since it has been able to reach northern Gaza, where much of the heaviest fighting has been taking place since Israel launched a ground invasion. "Heavy bombardment, movement restrictions, and interrupted communications are making it nearly impossible to deliver medical supplies regularly and safely across Gaza, particularly in the north", a WHO statement says. Sunday's delivery had been scheduled to ensure five hospitals in the north are able to continue treating people. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus says he is "shocked by the scale of health needs and devastation in northern Gaza", adding that any more delays will "will lead to more death and suffering for far too many people".
