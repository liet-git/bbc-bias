The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) says it has killed a Hezbollah commander in an air strike in the southern Lebanese town of Ain Baal. A statement says Ismail Youssef Baaz oversaw the Lebanese Shia armed group's “coastal sector”. “As part of his position, [Baaz] was involved in advancing and planning rocket and anti-tank missile launches toward Israel from the coastal area in Lebanon,” it adds. Hezbollah confirmed his death, without providing further details of his rank or how he was killed. Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency also reported that one person was killed and two others were injured in an Israeli strike in Ain Baal on Tuesday. Hezbollah is funded, trained and armed by Iran and is designated a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK, US and other countries. Its fighters have exchanged fire with Israeli forces almost every day along the border since the start of the war between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas in the Gaza Strip in October. The clashes have raised fears of a wider regional conflict. On Monday, Israeli military officials said four soldiers were wounded by an explosion as they operated hundreds of metres inside Lebanese territory. Hezbollah said its fighters had detonated explosive devices in the area. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
