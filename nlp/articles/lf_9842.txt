In the southern Lebanese village of Khirbet Selem today, crowds gathered for the funeral of Wissam Tawil, a senior Hezbollah commander, one day after he was killed in a suspected Israeli strike. The coffin, wrapped in Hezbollah’s yellow flag, was carried in a procession through the streets, with mourners chanting prayers. His killing was a significant development in the current crisis between Hezbollah, the powerful Iranian-backed Lebanese group, and Israel. Tawil, a member of Hezbollah’s elite Radwan force, was the most senior Hezbollah figure to be killed in the current violence, raising fears of a major confrontation. Cross-border attacks have continued, with Hezbollah attacking positions in Israel, and reports suggesting another senior commander of the group was killed in southern Lebanon in a strike believed to have been carried out by Israel. Up until now, Hezbollah has calibrated its attacks, and the violence has been largely contained to border areas. The group is seen by Israel as a much more formidable foe than Hamas: it has thousands of well-trained fighters, and about 130,000 rockets, including guided missiles capable of striking deep inside Israel. Israeli authorities say it is imperative to restore security in the north of the country - even if that means the use of military force. Some, including Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, have warned the group any escalation could lead to a devastating response, saying the military can do to Beirut what it has done to Gaza. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
