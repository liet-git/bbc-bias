Let's bring you a little more detail on who's joining Laura on today's show. UK Foreign Secretary Lord David Cameron joined Rishi Sunak’s cabinet back in the autumn, and since then has been charged with steering the agenda on some of the UK’s most high profile policies - including the Middle East, the Russian war in Ukraine and navigating the country’s post-Brexit relationship with the EU. Jonathan Ashworth, the Labour MP for Leicester South, will be up to bat for the opposition. Both he and Cameron are likely to be questioned about what's happening in the Middle East, as well as domestic policy. And then later in the show, actor Dominic West will also be popping by to share some details about his latest project at the West End. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
