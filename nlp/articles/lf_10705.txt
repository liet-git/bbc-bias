As we've been reporting, four people have been killed in Jenin in the occupied West Bank, in what witnesses describe as a drone strike this morning. The Israeli army is still manoeuvring here in Jenin city. We’ve seen armoured bulldozers making their way towards the hospital at the end of the street, and trucks passing in the opposite direction. A large group of young men are creeping up the road towards the heart of the operation, one man is carrying a rudimentary homemade pipe bomb, another a walkie talkie. Other than that, the streets here are almost completely deserted. And in the last few moments, two very loud explosions have echoed over Jenin and now large plumes of white smoke are rising from  Al-Jaberiat, on the hillside overlooking the city. It's not clear what the target was. Army vehicles are still lined up next to the hospital at the entrance to the camp, and we’ve just seen what looks like an explosive device detonate on the ground in front of them.
