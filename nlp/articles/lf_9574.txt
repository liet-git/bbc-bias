The founder of World Central Kitchen (WCK) José Andrés says his workers were killed by an Israeli air strike, and called on the Israeli government "to stop this indiscriminate killing". Gaza's Hamas-run media office also blames Israel. WCK says the group were attacked after leaving a warehouse in Deir al-Balah where they had unloaded more than 100 tons of humanitarian food aid brought to Gaza  via ship. The strike cannot be verified independently at the moment and details are still emerging. Israel's military says it is conducting a thorough review at the highest level to understand the circumstances of this "tragic incident". T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
