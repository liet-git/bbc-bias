 F-N-S-T-A-R-T. 9085 F-N-E-N-D.  D-A-T-E-S-T-A-R-T. 2024-05-24 D-A-T-E-E-N-D.  T-I-T-L-E-S-T-A-R-T. ICJ order designed to prevent situation in Gaza further deteriorating. T-I-T-L-E-E-N-D.  T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. This is the first time the ICJ has issued a ruling that compels Israel to significantly change its military operation in Gaza. The international panel of judges said that Israel had not convinced them that the evacuation efforts and related measures that Israel affirms to have undertaken to enhance the security of civilians in the Gaza Strip, and in particular those recently displaced from from Rafah, are sufficient to alleviate the immense risk to which the Palestinian population is exposed as a result of the military offensive in Rafah. The case was brought by South Africa under the genocide convention, created 1948 after the Holocaust to give legal foundation to the words never again. South Africa argued Palestinian's inalienable right to protection under that convention was at risk of being violated and called on the ICJ, the UN's highest court, as guardian of that treaty - to step in. Today's decision isn't about whether or not genocidal acts are being committed in Gaza, but rather whether there is a plausible risk to the Palestinian peoples right to protection. This order is designed to act as an injunction to stop the situation from deteriorating or at least keep it in a kind of holding pattern, until the judges consider the wider merits of the case.
