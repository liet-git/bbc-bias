Antony Blinken has departed from Abu Dhabi for the Saudi Arabian city of AlUla, where he will soon meet with Mohammed bin Salman. The Saudi crown prince has made AlUla his winter residence. Last week, he hosted a series of meetings with US congressional officials, including Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, and Republican South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham. AlUla is a 6th Century BCE city located around an oasis that was a stop on an ancient spice and silk trading route. Like the better known Nabatean Kingdom city of Petra in Jordan, it features intricate rock carvings and elaborate tombs and is listed as a Unesco World Heritage site. The choice of location for visits by Blinken and other US officials is no accident. While the town was once off-limits to Muslims because it was viewed as cursed by the Prophet Muhammad, Prince Mohammed has made turning AlUla into an arts and tourism destination a key part of his “Vision 2030” plan to modernise the Arab kingdom, with festivals and western-built hotels and attractions.
