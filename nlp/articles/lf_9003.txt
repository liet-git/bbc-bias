The UN report into human rights violations in the West Bank since 7 October says that Palestinians live in constant terror of violence from Israeli forces and settlers. From 1 January to 27 December this year, the UN verified the deaths of 492 Palestinians at the hands of Israeli forces, the highest number since the UN began keeping records. The report accuses Israeli security forces of carrying out daily mass arrests, “in most cases not linked to the commission of a criminal offence”. Soldiers explicitly said that cases of ill-treatment monitored by the UN were in retaliation for the atrocities committed by Hamas on 7 October. In the weeks following the Hamas attack, the report finds a sharp rise in settler attacks with an average of six incidents per day, such as shootings, burning of homes and vehicles, and uprooting of olive trees - a vital income source. In many incidents, settlers were accompanied by Israeli security forces, or were themselves wearing security uniforms, and carrying army rifles, the report said. UN Human Rights Chief Volker Turk has called for an end to settler violence in the West Bank and urged Israeli authorities to “strongly censure and prevent settler violence and prosecute both its instigators and perpetrators. ”. Israel is yet to respond to the findings of the report. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
