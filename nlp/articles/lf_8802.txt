Dr Ahmed Moghrabi is the head of the plastic surgery and burns unit at Nasser Hospital, which Rushdi mentioned in his post below. He spoke to the BBC after finishing work late on Friday night and fought back tears as he described the toll of the last few weeks on him and his family. "Yesterday I spoke with my wife (about) if we could just flee and leave all this behind us. . . Because I couldn't stand more. " He went on: "My wife, my children, they don't want to stay here because of these sounds of executions. "I have a daughter, three years old. She always asks me (for) some sweets, some apples, some fruits. I can't provide. I feel helpless. " Only a few days ago on Wednesday, Dr Moghrabi spoke of a desperate situation - you can remind yourself of that interview below. 'I'm helpless' - Gaza doctor tells of desperate situation.
