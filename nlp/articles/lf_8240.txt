Now Siobhan Baillie , the Conservative MP for Stroud, asks about fees for ID verification, which she says are creating a "perfect cyber storm". She says bereaved parents want new measures to protect children, fraudsters are routinely using fake IDs to scam, and "faceless, traceless bots" are interfering with politics across the globe. The PM agrees verification can be a powerful tool and the home secretary is meeting tech companies on Monday to raise these points. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
