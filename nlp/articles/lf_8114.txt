Sound and fury aside, it was the Labour amendment calling for an "immediate humanitarian ceasefire", that was ultimately voted through by the Commons yesterday. This was different from the SNP's original motion for an "immediate ceasefire", the text of which also referred to “collective punishment of the Palestinian people” which is a technical term amounting to a war crime. Labour's position emphasises the role of Hamas, alongside Israel, in bringing about a lasting pause in fighting. It also calls for "rapid and unimpeded" humanitarian relief to be allowed into the Gaza Strip. The amendment passed. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
