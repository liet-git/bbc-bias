T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. We've made contact with 26-year-old Farida Adel, an English teacher from Gaza City, who spoke to the BBC last year - soon after the fighting began. She is currently sheltering in Rafah, south Gaza, and tells us the following about her situation: "I don’t know where to start," she messages. "Every morning I don’t expect to still be alive. "Every night we know we could die at any moment, which is psychologically draining. We are so exhausted, so devastated from this condition, this war has gone on for too long. " When Farida fled Gaza City, she left behind her parents and four siblings - Diana, Jihad, Hosni and Youssef. She says there is nothing left to eat where they are. "I really miss them," she says. "The last thing I think about before going to sleep is my family. If they’re able to eat, if they’re still alive. "Yesterday my heart broke when my sister Diana sent me a picture of bread made from animal feed, which is all they have to eat there. " Farida has, at times, been forced to sleep on the streets since fleeing her home in Gaza City. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
