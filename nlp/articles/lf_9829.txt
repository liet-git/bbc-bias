US Secretary of State Antony Blinken says "the charge of genocide at the international court is meritless. " Those attacking Israel, such as Hamas and the Houthis, he says, "continue to openly call for the annihilation of Israel and the mass murder of Jews". He said the fighting was particularly difficult in Gaza "because Hamas hides in and fires from schools and hospital". T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
