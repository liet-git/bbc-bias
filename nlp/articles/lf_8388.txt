As we've been reporting, Rafah city in the south of Gaza has been hit by air strikes for another day. Many internally displaced Gazans are seeking shelter in the region, which the UN's Palestinian refugee agency warned is lacking in humanitarian aid and overcrowded. The BBC has not been able to independently verify how many air strikes have hit Rafah today. Yesterday's bombardment in Rafah, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, killed at least 20 people. Images from today show smoke billowing the sky in Rafah after Israeli air strikes. Meanwhile, some Palestinians in Rafah look through rubble after buildings were flattened. Others were photographed running in fear. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
