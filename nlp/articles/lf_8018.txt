T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Christopher Henzel, a former US ambassador to Yemen and Saudi Arabia, has been talking to BBC Newsday about the tricky tightrope the US has to walk over its relationship with Israel. Henzel says that, in theory, the US has “massive leverage over Israel as the key supplier of these weapons and other sort of support” but that in practice, "the US is not going to exercise that leverage". "So instead, it falls to these statements and declarations in the Security Council, which I don’t think in the near term will put too much pressure on Israel,” he adds. Commenting on Blinken’s visit to the region and the negotiations in Doha, he says that he suspects Israel would not be “in the mood” to agree to any ceasefire and that Hamas is not ready to back down.
