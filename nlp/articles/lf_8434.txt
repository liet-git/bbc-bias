Four major shipping firms have stopped vessels going through the Red Sea, due to recent attacks from Yemen by Houthi rebels, a movement backed by Iran. The companies have halted operations after the Houthis said they would target vessels as part of their support for Gaza in the war with Israel. Sue Terpilowski, the vice chair for the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport, told the BBC: "The Red Sea is vital for trade, 12% of all goods traded in the world pass through it. It is the artery between Asia and Europe. " International naval forces are present in the Red Sea and attempting to stop the attacks. The US has said one of its warships shot down more than a dozen attack drones on Sturday and a UK Royal Navy warship also intercepted a suspected drone . Egypt's Suez Canal chief said today that the country has rerouted 55 ships since 19 November. The Houthis, who seized power in Yemen nine years ago, have announced their support for Hamas and say they are targeting ships travelling to Israel. The US is under pressure from Israel to do something about these attacks but Washington is reluctant to target the Houthi missile locations as they fear it could risk expanding the Israel-Hamas conflict and trigger retaliation from Iran. Maersk is one of several shipping companies to pause all traffic. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
