The map below - using analysis of satellite data by Corey Scher of CUNY Graduate Center and Jamon Van Den Hoek of Oregon State University - shows which urban areas have sustained concentrated damage since the start of the conflict. They say at least 150,000 buildings across the whole Gaza Strip have suffered damage. North Gaza and Gaza City have borne the brunt of this, with at least 80% of buildings believed to have been damaged. The analysis also suggests up to 64% of buildings further south in the Khan Younis area have been damaged. Aid workers say more than 500,000 people will have no homes to return to after the conflict because of the damage to buildings and infrastructure. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
