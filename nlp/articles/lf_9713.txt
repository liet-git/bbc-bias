Ministers are under pressure – including from some prominent Conservative figures – to suspend arms sales to Israel, following the killing of three British aid workers. Government insiders are stressing that while the UK exports some military parts to Israel, these account for only around 0.02% of its imports. And, these insiders add, their position is driven not by politics but by legal advice, which is kept under constant review. Both Labour and eminent lawyers are calling for that advice to be made public, but I’m told there is no intention to do so. David Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, has said he has "serious concerns" about whether Israel is abiding by international humanitarian law. And Labour leadership, too, are under pressure from some influential politicians within their ranks – including the mayor of London and the party leader on Scotland – to call for an arms ban now. Israel’s agreement to reopen new aid routes into Gaza may take some pressure off the UK government to take further action on arms sales. At the moment exhortation appears to be the government’s approach, with Lord David Cameron calling for "a major change in the conduct of the conflict". That rhetoric is robust but unless the reality on the ground changes, then divisions within and between the major parties here is likely to persist. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
