Fighting in built-up areas, known in military jargon as "FIBUA", has always been notoriously difficult, especially when one side is accused of hiding itself amongst the civilian population and uses civil infrastructure for military purposes. But today’s admission by Israel’s military, the IDF, that its fatal targeting of humanitarian aid workers on Monday was "a grave mistake" is further proof that its entire military operation in Gaza cannot possibly achieve its aims without inflicting intolerable civilian casualties. The admission contained in today’s IDF statement that the coordination plan agreed between it and the World Central Kitchen charity "was not distributed down to operational level" is symptomatic of a wider problem. In the confusion of this 3-dimensional conflict, with drone pilots remotely targeting buildings, people and vehicles from the air, coordination with those on the ground is not working as it should. Given the fact that six months into this operation significant elements of Hamas, including its leadership, have survived to fight on, it is hard to see how further mistakes are going to be avoided without a major overhaul of the IDF’s operational procedures, something likely to be resisted by commanders on the ground.
