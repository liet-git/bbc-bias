T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Israeli cabinet minister Benny Gantz has called for early elections to be held in September, as Israeli PM Netanyahu faces pressure and huge demonstrations demanding his resignation. Millions of Israelis who believe they are fighting a just war against Hamas have no confidence in Netanyahu, the BBC's Jeremy Bowen explains. Many are angry at him for prolonging the war to put off the moment when he is held accountable for his mistakes, failing to bring Israel's hostages home safely, and alienating vital allies starting with President Biden. Reacting to Gantz, Netanyahu's Likud party said elections during war "will bring about paralysis, division, harm to the fighting in Rafah and a fatal blow to the chances of a hostage deal". Families and supporters of Israeli hostages stormed Israel's parliament today in protest at Netanyahu's handling of the crisis. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
