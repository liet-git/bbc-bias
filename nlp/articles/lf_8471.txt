T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. The son of an Israeli hostage who was kidnapped by Hamas during their 7 October attacks has called for the Israeli government to make Hamas, "an offer they wouldn't be able to refuse", so that his father can be released. Lior Peri, whose father Chaim Peri has been missing since those attacks, told the BBC he and other hostage families have been "shouting" for the government to negotiate a ceasefire to secure the release of their loved ones but that, "nobody seems to listen". Peri also responded to the news that three Israeli hostages were accidentally killed by Israeli forces in Gaza saying that he was, "completely devastated" by the news. "People who managed to survive the horrific Hamas [captivity] for 70 days. . . only to be killed by accident by the IDF, that's horrible," Peri said, adding that the deaths "could have been prevented" if negotiations had continued. Peri also expressed concern that the ongoing ground offensive by Israeli forces in Gaza could result in a "body recovery operation" for the remaining hostages if negotiations for their release are not stepped up.
