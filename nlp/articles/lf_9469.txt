The White House says it does not expect the Israeli air strike that killed seven aid workers in Gaza on Monday to impact ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas. US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby says discussions are ongoing about how to get more aid into Gaza by sea. "The ceasefire and hostage negotiations are ongoing. I wouldn't anticipate any particular impact on those discussions as a result of the strike," Kirby says. Yesterday the Cypriot government said ships carrying aid to Gaza were turned back after the attack on the aid workers. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
