Blinken says Russian President Vladimir Putin thinks he can "outwit" Ukraine and outwit Ukraine's supporters but the message is that he can't. He says the international community is putting Ukraine on a long-term path where it can stand "strongly on its own two feet" with several security pacts. He says there is also work being done to drive private sector investment into Ukraine.
