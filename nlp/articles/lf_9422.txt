Good morning and thanks for joining our live coverage of this week’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme. It’s been a busy few days in UK politics since last week’s local election results, with Natalie Elphicke, the new Labour MP for Dover, defecting from the Conservatives on Wednesday. The party’s shadow paymaster general Jonathan Ashworth is likely to be asked about this when he appears on this morning’s show. Also on the programme is Foreign Secretary David Cameron, who will be speaking after Israel told thousands more Palestinians to leave Rafah, as it intensifies military operations in southern Gaza. He’s also likely to be quizzed about UK arms sales to Israel, after the US said Israel may have breached international law with American weapons in Gaza.
