A truce between Israel and Hamas was never going to be easy. But international pressure is growing. Perhaps the biggest sign is the Biden administration sending William Burns, the head of the CIA, for the latest round of mediated talks in Cairo. In Israel, there are angry calls from the families of the hostages held in Gaza, who are urging a deal for their release, saying time is running out to save them. But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is also facing pressure from hardline allies who support his coalition, and are against the idea of making concessions to Hamas. They say the war must continue, which would include an offensive into the southern city of Rafah, where 1.5 million Palestinians are sheltering. Hamas says it is analysing the latest proposal, which includes the release of 40 hostages in return for 900 Palestinians from Israeli jails. A final decision will probably be made by Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader in Gaza who is thought to be hiding in tunnels surrounded by guards and hostages. Read more from Hugo here.
