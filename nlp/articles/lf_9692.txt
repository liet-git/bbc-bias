It would begin with a six-week ceasefire , during which the IDF would withdraw from populated areas of Gaza. Hamas would release "a number" of hostages - including women, the elderly and the wounded - in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Some remains of dead Israeli hostages would be returned to their families. Palestinian civilians would return to their homes in all areas of Gaza. Humanitarian assistance would "surge", with 600 trucks a day entering the strip, and hundreds of thousands of temporary housing units sent by the international community. During that six week period, negotiations mediated by the US and Qatar would continue. If successful, the next part of the plan would begin. PHASE TWO. Release of all remaining living hostages, including male soldiers. Full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. The ceasefire would be upgraded to the "cessation of hostilities permanently" PHASE THREE. Any final remains of Israeli hostages in Gaza would be returned. A "major reconstruction plan" for Gaza would commence, including US and international assistance to rebuild homes, schools and hospitals. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
