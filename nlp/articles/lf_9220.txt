T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. In the hours preceding today’s reports, Iran’s Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian warned that his country's response to any retaliation by Israel would be “immediate and at a maximum level". He made the comments during an interview on CNN on Thursday. Earlier this week, he said his country’s attack on Israel on Saturday - which involved more than 300 drones and missiles - amounted to "exercising the right of legitimate defence". Tehran has maintained that the action it took was retaliation for a presumed Israeli air strike on its consulate in Syria on 1 April, in which 13 people were killed. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
