We first spoke to Tala Abu Nahla in November, when the Israeli offensive was just a few weeks old, as she and her family, including her disabled brother, made their third attempt to leave Gaza via the Rafah crossing. She told us then: "We are trying to survive. We're not sure we're going to make it, but we're trying to do everything we can to survive, because I simply don't want to die at 24. The family were finally allowed to enter Egypt in February but Tala told us that now her family is safe she struggles with feelings of guilt for those they left behind. Nawara al-Najjar told the BBC about the night her husband, Abed-Alrahman, was killed during an Israeli special forces mission to rescue two hostages. Nawara, who has six children and was six months pregnant at the time, awoke to the sound of shooting nearby before shrapnel ripped through their tent, killing Abed-Alrahman and injuring her children. Weeping, she asked: "What was his sin? What was his children's sin? What's my sin? I became a widow at 27. ”. Tala says her younger brother Yazid is very afraid, and his seizures are getting "worse and worse" Abed-Alrahman al-Najjar (centre) was killed on 12 February. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
