T-I-T-L-E-E-N-D.  T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Welcome to our live coverage of the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. Later today, we’re expecting three European countries - Ireland, Spain and Norway - to formally recognise a Palestinian state . There is already majority support for Palestinian statehood among the world’s nations but these three announcements will mark a significant shift in Europe, where recognition is limited. It comes less than 48 hours after scores of civilians were killed in an air strike near the city of Rafah in Gaza, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has described as a “tragic mishap”. An investigation within the Israeli military is under way amid international condemnation. Fighting continues around Rafah, where Netanyahu has once again promised "absolute victory", despite warnings about the risk of civilian casualties if the military operation continues. We’ll bring you updates and analysis on these developments when we get them, so stay with us. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
