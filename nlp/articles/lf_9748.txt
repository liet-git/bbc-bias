The quickest, most effective way to get aid into Gaza is over land - but the entry of trucks via two crossings in southern Gaza has so far not met the need for food. People are suffering severe food shortages, with the UN saying children in northern Gaza are starving to death and famine is looming. A deadly Israeli air strike on one aid agency - World Central Kitchen - has caused it to pause its operations, along with another agency. Cogat, the Israeli body that coordinates humanitarian aid to Gaza, said on 1 April that an average of 140 trucks a day carrying food entered Gaza. It said this was more than the 70 trucks carrying food specifically that entered Gaza before the war (500 trucks in total entered Gaza each day before the war). But military operations and the breakdown of social order have severely hampered aid distribution, while Gaza's food production has also been reduced to almost nothing, with farms, bakeries and factories destroyed or inaccessible. As not enough food is reaching people via land, countries have been trying alternative routes via the skies and sea - but these too have been beset by problems. Read more here. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
