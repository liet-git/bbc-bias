The leader of Hamas says Monday's UN Security Council vote shows that Israel is in "unprecedented isolation", Iran's official news agency IRNA reports. Speaking during a press conference in Tehran, Ismail Haniyeh adds that Israel's "isolation" shows that "America is unable to impose its will on the world community" - referring to the status of the US as Israel's strongest ally. Haniyeh adds that Israel's position demonstrates "the unique resistance of Hamas and the Palestinian people". Speaking about the contents of the Security Council resolution, which calls for an immediate ceasefire during the month of Ramadan and the unconditional release of Israeli hostages, Haniyeh says the resolution has some "shortcomings". Israel has accused Hamas - which controls the Gaza Strip - of making "delusional" demands over ceasefire negotiations. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
