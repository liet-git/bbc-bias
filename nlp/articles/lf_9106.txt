As we've been reporting, the funeral of Hamas deputy leader, Saleh al-Arouri is under way in Lebanon . However, he is originally from here in the occupied West Bank. His hometown of Aroura is not far from where I am reporting from. There is a service there during his funeral and burial in Beirut. His house in Aroura was destroyed by the Israeli army after the 7 October attacks. People protesting in Ramallah for the last two days say they see Arouri as a figure of the resistance - though despite chanting his name, many of the protesters say they are there to back "the resistance" rather than any faction or group. “Ours is a message of freedom we are a civilised, educated people who love the other who want to coexist", one of the protesters here in Ramallah, Hesham Abu Raya, tells me. He said the people here feel abandoned. "Some rights could only be obtained through resistance after we’ve been let down by the leaders. " Hamas has continued firing rockets into Israel. They’ve been adamant that there will be no deal to release more hostages unless there is a complete ceasefire - a proposition that is out of the question for Israel. After the killing of Arouri, Arab media reported that Egypt has suspended its mediation efforts. People are angry in Ramallah over Arouri's death. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
