In the months following the 7 October attacks by Hamas, Israel repeatedly told Palestinians living in north and central Gaza to move south for their own safety. As a result, the population of the southern city of Rafah has increased more than fivefold – to about 1.4 million, according to the Norwegian Refugee Council. The satellite images below show rows of tents and other temporary structures which appeared in an area in north-west Rafah between 15 October 2023 and 4 February 2024. In total, the tents cover roughly 3.5 sq km (1.3 sq miles), equivalent to nearly 500 football pitches. As we are await the latest high-quality satellite images, it's not possible to say if any of those tents were hit by air strikes over the weekend. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
