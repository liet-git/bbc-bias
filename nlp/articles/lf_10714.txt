T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. The US is facing criticism from some quarters for not doing more to stop the killing of civilians in Gaza. A few hours ago we heard from Nathaniel Tek, a spokesman for the US State Department, who said they are "pressing" the Israeli government to "[put] a premium on civilian life". "We believe it is critical that Israel places a premium on the protection of human life, and for the ability of aid organisations to access civilians," he told the BBC's Newsday programme. But he also said that "there certainly is more that can be done, and more precise and clear directions can be given to civilians to ensure they can reach safety". Israel can only achieve a "strategic victory" if it protects civilians and works toward a more enduring peace, he added. "So there are two aspects to this, the moral and the strategic, that we have been trying to push," he said. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
