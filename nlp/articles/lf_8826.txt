"This is the moment of truth," he says. "This is a turning point in history. " Palestine's representative adds that the security council has failed to uphold its responsibility in the face of what he calls "a grave crisis". "Millions of Palestinian lives hang in the balance. Every single one of them is sacred, worth saving. " He says that Israel conducts its war "through atrocities," and that "hundreds of people will be killed by this time tomorrow. " "Children will be killed, orphaned, wounded, disabled for life," he says. "Not by mistake, but by design, because the killers have no regard whatsoever for Palestinian life, from the cradle to the grave and beyond. " Palestine became an observer state at the UN in 2012.
