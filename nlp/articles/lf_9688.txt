UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron has reiterated Biden's call for Hamas to accept the peace deal on the table. In a message on social media platform X, Lord Cameron says: "With a new hostage agreement on the table, Hamas must accept this deal so we can see a stop in the fighting, the hostages released and returned to their families and a flood of humanitarian aid into Gaza. "As we’ve long argued a stop in the fighting can be turned into a permanent peace if we are all prepared to take the right steps. Let’s seize this moment and bring this conflict to an end.
