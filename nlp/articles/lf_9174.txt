T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. It is not clear what, if anything, was targeted in the overnight Israeli strike in Iran. However, it should not really come as a surprise that explosions were reported in the central province of Isfahan. Isfahan is the home of several nuclear facilities, including the Isfahan Nuclear Technology Centre and the Natanz uranium enrichment plant. Iran accused Israel of sabotaging the latter in April 2021 , when there was an explosion in an underground area that damaged a large number of centrifuges. Israeli media reported at the time that it was an operation by the Mossad intelligence agency. There are also a number of important military sites in Isfahan, including Shahid Babaei airbase and facilities for the development and production of missiles. In January 2023, Iran blamed Israel for a attack on a what it called a “workshop complex” in the centre Isfahan city , which it said involved three drones and caused minor damage. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at the time that his country had been “taking action against certain weapons development" in Iran, but he neither confirmed nor denied involvement. In January 2023, there was a drone attack on a military factory in the centre of Isfahan city, which Iran blamed on Israel. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
