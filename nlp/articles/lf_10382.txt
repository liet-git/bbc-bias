We've heard from Ehud Olmert, a former prime minister of Israel, who warns against an offensive in Rafah and says "we have to stop the fighting now". Speaking to BBC Radio 4's World at One programme about the prospect of such an attack, he says: "The likelihood of an additional military victory of great consequence is very small. " Olmert has been a vocal critic of current Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and has for months been calling for the war to be brought to an end and to avoid an offensive into Rafah. He says the argument that an offensive into the southern Gazan city is needed to go after individuals that Israel holds responsible for the 7 October attack, including the leader of Hamas's political wing in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, could keep the war going "forever" and at the "expense of losing the lives of the hostages". Challenged over whether the killing of four Israeli soldiers overnight shows Hamas is still a danger, Olmert says there can be no "absolute victory" and Hamas fighters will remain - warning that continuing the fighting will also lead to causalities.
