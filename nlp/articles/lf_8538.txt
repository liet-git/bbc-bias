T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. US National Security Council spokesman John Kirby is speaking at the White House briefing and - after repeating some of the lines we've covered already from Biden and Netanyahu's call - sends Israel a clear message. He says the US, in the coming hours and days, will be looking for concrete steps that Israel has made. Elaborating, he says the US hopes to see a "dramatic increase" in humanitarian aid getting into Gaza - as well as a general reduction in violence against civilians and aid workers. Kirby says the US wants to see that the Israelis are "willing and able to take practical, immediate steps to protect aid workers and demonstrate that they had that they had civilian harm mitigation in place". He adds that more details on the specifics of these measures would need to be offered by the Israelis themselves. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
