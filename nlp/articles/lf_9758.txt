T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Human Rights Watch says Israel could change the impending threat of famine in Gaza if it allowed more aid and humanitarian supplies to enter the Strip, adding that "the ball is in Israel's court". Sari Bashi, its programme director, says: "This can change tomorrow. The Israeli military can open up adequate routes, and commit itself to providing the security needed to deliver food," she tells the BBC. She says that because the Israeli military is an occupying power in Gaza, it's not only obligated to facilitate humanitarian supplies, it's also obligated to bring them. "The Israeli military should not be bargaining how much food to let into Gaza in exchange for hostages, and Hamas and Islamic Jihad should not be bargaining how many hostages to release in exchange for food. " A UN-backed report released today said that 1.1 million people in Gaza are facing starvation. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
