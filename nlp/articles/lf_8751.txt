The Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) militant group has released a video showing an Israeli hostage alive, Israeli media reports. The man has been identified by Israeli media as 28-year-old Sasha Trupanov, a Russian-Israeli dual national. He's seen speaking in Hebrew in the 30-second clip, though it's unclear when the footage was taken. Trupanov was taken from his family home in Kibbutz Nir Oz on 7 October, along with his grandmother, mother and his partner. The three women were freed during a brief truce between Hamas and Israel in November, which led to the release of 105 hostages. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
