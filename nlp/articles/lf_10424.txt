I’ve heard nothing at Columbia University that could be described as antisemitic. But speaking to Jewish students on campus, they say they have heard different chants and slogans over the last six months - before the TV cameras arrived - including calls for a global intifada, which they interpret to mean Israelis and Jews should be killed. One Jewish student, who didn’t want to be named, had tears in her eyes as she told me she now feels deeply unwelcome on campus. The fact that an unauthorised protest is being allowed to continue makes her feel that the university authorities are on the side of the pro-Palestinian demonstrators and therefore not on the side of Jews. One wall in the middle of campus has been covered with photographs of Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, and a sign saying: “Bring them home NOW!" The Jewish students say that’s one thing they have never heard the protesters demand. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
