UK Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron has reiterated the UK position that it will not support a major Israeli operation in Rafah "unless there was a very clear plan for how to protect people and save lives". "We have not seen that plan, so in the circumstances we will not support a major operation in Rafah," Cameron says. He stresses a "fundamental difference" between the UK and US approach, where President Joe Biden has warned he will stop supplying some weapons to Israel if there is a Rafah offensive. The US is a massive state supplier of weapons to Israel. We do not have a UK Government supply of weapons to Israel, we have a number of licences, and I think our defence exports to Israel are responsible for significantly less than 1% of their total.
