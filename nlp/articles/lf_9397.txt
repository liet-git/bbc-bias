Coventry South MP Zarah Sultana, who was on today's panel, was asked about Natalie Elphicke's defection to the Labour Party this week. "I think it is great people are moving towards the Labour movement and the Labour Party," she answered. "Natalie Elphicke, however, is an interesting one because she is a former paid-up member of the ERG (European Research Group), she voted for Liz Truss in the leadership, she's at odds when it comes to fire-and-rehire, has attacked trade unions and their activities not great on the environment either," she said. "And it's concerning as well in terms of conversations I've had within the PLP (Parliamentary Labour Party), especially in the Women's PLP on the comments that she's made about her ex-husband and the trial.
