Labour's Ben Bradshaw puts it to Sunak that Kemi Badenoch, the equalities minister, claims she has "engaged extensively" with LGBT organisations while in office, however a freedom of information request reveals she's not met with "a single one", but has met "two fringe groups" that campaign against transgender rights. "What is the problem the prime minister and a section of his party has with transgender people?" Bradshaw asks. In response, Sunak says his government has a "proud" track record of supporting those in the LGBT community, "and will continue to do so". He says those questioning their gender should always be treated with the "utmost dignity, compassion and sensitivity", however alongside that, "it is completely reasonable to  highlight the importance of biological sex".
