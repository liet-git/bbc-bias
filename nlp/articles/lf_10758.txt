The judge is now turning to the humanitarian situation on the ground in Gaza. She quotes UN emergency relief coordinator Martin Griffiths, who says "Gaza has become a place of death and despair". The judge says 1.7 million people have been displaced in Gaza and the enclave has become "uninhabitable". She notes, however, that the numbers coming out of Gaza can't be independently verified. 1.4 million people are now in UN shelters where they lack everything, she says. She also notes the commissioner-general for the UN relief agency for Palestinian refugees has said the crisis in Gaza is compounded by inhumane language. She quotes some example of statements to this effect by senior Israelis. Judge Joan Donoghue. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
