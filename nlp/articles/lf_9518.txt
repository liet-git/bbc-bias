Kirby goes on to say that more than 200 aid workers have been killed in the conflict since the war began "making it one of the worst for aid workers in recent history". "This incident is emblematic of a larger problem and evidence of why distribution of aid in Gaza has been so challenging, " he says. Beyond the strike, he says what is clear is that the IDF must do "much more to improve deconfliction processes" so that civilians and humanitarian aid workers are protected. "The US will continue to press Israel to do more as well to ensure the safety of humanitarian workers and will continue to do all we can to deliver this assistance to Palestinian civilians in Gaza.
