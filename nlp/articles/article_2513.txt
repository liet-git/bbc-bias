Plaid Cymru has withdrawn support for one of its general election candidates due to social media posts about the "situation in the Middle East". Sharifah Rahman was due to represent the party in the Cardiff South and Penarth constituency. The party said the content of the social media posts "do not reflect the views and values of Plaid Cymru". BBC Wales has not been able to reach Ms Rahman for comment.  As this has happened so near to the close of nominations, Ms Rahman's name will remain on the ballot as Plaid candidate, but without support from the party. A Plaid Cymru spokesperson said: “Plaid Cymru has consistently condemned both the actions of Hamas terrorists on October 7 and the subsequent horrific bombardment of Gaza by the Israeli Government. "We reaffirm our calls for an immediate ceasefire, the unimpeded distribution of humanitarian aid and the cessation of arms sales to Israel. “Plaid Cymru will continue to campaign for a just peace and a two-state solution – including the recognition of the state of Palestine, and a peaceful future for both Palestinians and Israelis. "We condemn unequivocally any forms of prejudice and racism, including anti-Semitism and Islamophobia.
