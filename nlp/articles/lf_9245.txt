Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi alleges that Western nations are supporting a "genocide" in the Gaza Strip, in reference to Israel's bombardment of the besieged Palestinian enclave, according to Reuters. Speaking during a visit to Moscow, Raisi said it was necessary for the bombardment to stop "as soon as possible", and added it was "regretful" that international organisations have not been effective at stopping the violence. Iran has been one of Hamas's chief sponsors over the years, providing both financial assistance as well as rockets and other weapons to the Palestinian group. There are reports that Iran was involved in and gave the green light to Hamas's brutal attack on Israel on 7 October, although Tehran has denied those accusations. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
