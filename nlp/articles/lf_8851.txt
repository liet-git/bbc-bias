I have spoken to a 22-year-old Palestinian who was one of the dozens of men detained by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) in northern Gaza on Thursday. Footage of the detentions has gone viral on social media. He has asked to remain anonymous. “They (the IDF) forced us to sit in the middle of [the] street for almost three hours, then trucks came, they handcuffed and blindfolded us and they took us to an unknown place,” he told me by phone. When they arrived at the location, he said they were randomly selected for questioning and interrogated about their relationship with Hamas. He said the place that he, his father, brother and five cousins were taken to was sandy, and that they were left almost naked but given a blanket at night. After the questioning he was taken to an unknown location and simply told to go home, he said, arriving back at about 01:40 in the morning. “They released all of us, except my father and eldest cousin. My father works for UNRWA. I don’t know why they took him,” he said. “We walked barefoot down the street in the dark, with the roads full of rocks and glass. ”. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
