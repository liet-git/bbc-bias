Israel’s hostage families are losing patience. Today, they rallied in Tel Aviv to demand more action from their government to get their 129 loved ones out of captivity in Gaza. The revelation that Israeli soldiers shot dead three of the hostages, mistaking them for Hamas fighters, despite their carrying a white flag has only added to their belief that the current policy isn’t working. The Israeli government says only military pressure will force Hamas to give up their captives. Yet it was weeks of careful diplomatic mediation by Qatar and Egypt, backed by the United States, that saw more than a hundred hostages released earlier in the conflict. Relatives of those still held want those negotiations to be resumed. In an emotional press conference today, they said time was running out to save those left, they complained their government wasn’t listening to their demands and one said it was easier to get a meeting with President Biden than it was with their own cabinet ministers.
