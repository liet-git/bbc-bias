We're closing this page soon - so let's recap a busy morning. In coordinated announcements, Spain, Norway and Ireland unveiled plans to recognise a Palestinian state on 28 May. Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store said a two-state solution was the "only alternative"; while Ireland's PM Simon Harris said the decision would help create a "peaceful future" Palestinian leaders welcomed the decision - with the PLO calling it a "historic moment" But Israel reacted furiously, saying it would summon the three countries' ambassadors to watch a video of the 7 October attacks. "History will remember that Spain, Norway and Ireland decided to award a gold medal to the Hamas murderers and rapists," said Israeli foreign minister Israel Katz.
