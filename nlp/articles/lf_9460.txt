Hopes for a truce in Gaza have faded after a flurry of activity ahead of Ramadan - and the latest comments emerging over the status of negotiations suggest that little progress has been made. The prime minister of Qatar, which has been playing a key role in mediation, says the obstacles are the same as back in February. Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani did say that the Hamas demand for displaced Palestinians to be able to return to all parts of Gaza had become a major bone of contention. The political leader of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, has also reiterated that his movement is sticking to all its conditions for a truce; Hamas wants an end to the war, an influx of aid, the return of Gazans to their homes, a prisoner exchange with Israel and reconstruction. It seems that for now, at least, the gap between the positions of Hamas and the Israeli government remains too wide to reach a deal. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
