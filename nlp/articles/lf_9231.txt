T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Let's turn our attention to the White House now, where national security spokesperson John Kirby told a briefing Washington was "not close to inking another deal on a humanitarian pause". He also said there was no update to share on the return of hostages from Gaza. Meanwhile, White House national security aide John Finer has been giving an address at the Aspen Security Forum - during which he said the US has not given Israel a firm deadline to end its operations in Gaza. In comments reported by Reuters, he said that if the war ended now, Hamas would continue to pose a threat to Israel. Finer said there hadd been aspects of how Israel's military operations in northern Gaza had been conducted that did not show "sufficient care" for civilian life. "We work day in, day out, and engage directly, day in, day out, including today, frankly, between the president and the [Israeli] prime minister on how the conflict is being conducted in all parts of Gaza, but with a particular focus on the south," Finer said.
