Stephen Flynn, the SNP's Westminster leader, is up next. He uses the opportunity to talk about Israel-Gaza and the vote on the SNP's call for an immediate ceasefire, which is due after PMQs. "As it stands, some 60% of the buildings in Gaza are either damaged or destroyed. . . some 30,000 people are dead, and 1.4 million people are currently sheltering in Rafah awaiting an imminent Israeli onslaught," he says. Flynn asks the PM whether this can amount to "self-defence". Sunak responds as we would expect saying he "shares the concern" of Flynn on the high number of casualties and calls for an "immediate humanitarian pause". This is a shadow debate of what we can expect later - the SNP and Labour calling for a ceasefire and the government a pause. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
