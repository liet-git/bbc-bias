The White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre says President Biden has spoken by phone with World Central Kitchen (WCK) founder chef José Andrés and expressed that he was "heartbroken" by the news of the air strike that killed seven of its workers last night. Biden wanted to "share his deepest condolences and is grieving with the entire WCK family", the press secretary goes on to say. She says it was important to recognise the contribution the WCK has made to the people of Gaza and to people around the world. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
