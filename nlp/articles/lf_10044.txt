T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. We just heard again from National Security Council spokesman John Kirby, who has been making the rounds on the morning talk shows here in the US. Speaking to George Stephanopoulos on ABC's This Week just a few moments ago, Kirby says that - from a military standpoint - yesterday was "extraordinary" and that the attack on Israel was met with a "sense of unprecedented resolve". "Truly a successful night, due to a lot of skill, a lot of professionalism and a lot of coordination across the board," he says, adding that he believes that the US "made good [on] our commitment" to help Israel. He adds that the attack and response show that "a coalition" stands ready to help defend Israel, while Iran is "just increasingly further isolated in the region. " "It [also] tells me that Israel does have superior military capability," he says. "Just think about the hardware that Iran threw into the sky and how little damage that caused. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
