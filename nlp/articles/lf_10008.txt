Cameron is discussing the UK's involvement in the response to Iran's attack. He says he wouldn't "overstate what we did on Saturday night", but the UK did provide airplanes to backfill for the US as part of another separate joint operation. That allowed the US to do more to protect Israel, he says, adding that the UK told its pilots if drones and missiles were coming in from where they were they should shoot them down, "and they did". He says it's a testament to their "skill, brilliance, to their bravery". T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
