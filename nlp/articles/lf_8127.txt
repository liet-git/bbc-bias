Stephen Flynn from the SNP has been telling BBC News he wanted to call for a ceasefire in Gaza with his party's motion, but "this place has turned it into a complete pantomime. " The SNP motion was unable to be voted on, he says, because the Labour party put pressure on the Speaker so that "Labour's show was the only show in town. " "This was all about something so much bigger than us and yet here we are talking about all of the wrong things" he says. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
