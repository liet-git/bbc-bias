The abstention on the Gaza ceasefire vote at the UN does not represent a shift in policy, White House spokesman John Kirby said. Kirby said the final UN resolution did not have language the US deemed essential - hence the abstenion. He also said that the US would keep talking to Israeli counterparts even if - as we just reported - they didn't send a delegation this week. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
