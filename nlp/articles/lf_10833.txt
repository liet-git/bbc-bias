A former UK diplomat has said the government should "get off the fence" on Gaza and call for all violence against civilians to stop. Tom Fletcher, who worked as a foreign policy advisor to former PM Gordon Brown, says senior UN officials on the ground have told him "Gaza is becoming a slaughterhouse". Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he explains a UK decision to vote for a ceasefire at the UN security council during 2009 Israel-Gaza conflict contributed to a truce motion, despite US government oppostion to it. "It moved the US to an abstention and so people say UN Security Council resolutions are just demonstrative, but we had a ceasefire within a week of that resolution. " On Friday, the US vetoed a similar call for a ceasefire and the UK abstained at the security council. All other members voted in favour, including China, Russia and France - the three other permanent members with veto power. Fletcher acknowledges the violence in Israel and Gaza since 7 October is "on a completely difference scale" to 2009, but adds that the "fundamentals are the same, we've got to protect civilians in Israel and Palestine". The problem is abstention just annoys everyone equally. . . In the interests of Israeli's and Palestinians, I think [the UK] called it wrong last week. " The US government vetoed a call for a ceasefire called by the UN secretary general. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
