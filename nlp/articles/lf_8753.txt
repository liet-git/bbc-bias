T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Weather conditions are "expected" to impact the US military pier set-up to help deliver aid to Gaza, according to a former Pentagon official involved with the plan. The US military began building the floating pier - which is attached to Gaza's shoreline by a temporary causeway - several weeks ago. On 17 May, the US military confirmed that the first shipments of humanitarian aid were delivered into Gaza via the pier, but last weekend four vessels supporting the pier became unmoored in "heavy sea states", beaching two of them. Mick Mulroy, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for the Middle East and one of the founders of Fogbow, a private firm involved in the Gaza pier plan, told the BBC that weather-related delays were "expected" to "pose challenges". "But those challenges can be overcome, and the mission itself is worth the effort," he said. "People are in desperate need of aid and this is one means to deliver it. " In a separate incident last week, three US soldiers taking part in the Gaza pier mission were injured, one of whom was in critical condition and evacuated to a hospital in Israel. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
