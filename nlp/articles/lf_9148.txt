Here's more reaction from key regional players to the events overnight. Russia says it has had contact with both Israel and its ally Iran. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov says Russia "made it very clear" to Israel that Iran "does not want escalation" as part of these discussions. Jordan , which shares a border with Israel and played a role repelling the Iranian missile and drone attacks last weekend, has also warned against the "danger of regional escalation" and called for an end to Israeli-Iranian retaliations. "We condemn all actions that threaten dragging the region into war," Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi says in a statement. Across the Persian Gulf from Iran, the United Arab Emirates says "substantial solutions to the ongoing disputes and crises" in the Middle East must be found. Its foreign ministry also calls for conflicts to be resolved through "dialogue and diplomatic channels". T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
