Todayâ€™s vote in the House of Commons on calls for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza comes as Israel t hreatens to send troops into Rafah , defying international opposition. Its government says that unless Hamas frees all hostages held in Gaza by 10 March an offensive will be launched. More than a million displaced Palestinians, who represent about half of Gaza's population, are sheltering in the southern city. Many are living in makeshift shelters or tents in squalid conditions, with scarce access to safe drinking water or food. Last night, the US vetoed an Algerian-proposed resolution at the UN demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. In its own draft resolution, urging a temporary ceasefire, the US warns Israel not to invade Rafah. Israel launched its operations in Gaza following an attack by Hamas gunmen on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and more than 240 others taken hostage . The Israeli military campaign has killed 29,000 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry there. Palestinian children wait to receive food cooked by a charity kitchen in Rafah.
