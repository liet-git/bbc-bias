 F-N-S-T-A-R-T. 8143 F-N-E-N-D.  D-A-T-E-S-T-A-R-T. 2024-02-21 D-A-T-E-E-N-D.  T-I-T-L-E-S-T-A-R-T. Gaza vote transformed into a protest vote about Commons procedure. T-I-T-L-E-E-N-D.  T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. There have not been scenes like this in the Commons Chamber since the fevered days of the Brexit debates when John Bercow was the speaker. The current Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, was supposed to restore decorum and calm. And so far, he’s done that. But the tense and sensitive issue of Gaza – and the raised political temperature ahead of a general election – has led to angry voices and confusion. His attempt to find a way through tricky political waters infuriated the Scottish National Party and Conservatives who believed he was easing a difficult situation for Labour. So tonight, we have a packed chamber, furious MPs: Confusion all round about procedure. And no sign of the Speaker himself, with his Deputy, Dame Rosie Winterton trying to fend off criticism and maintain order. The expected votes on Gaza have been replaced now by a protest vote about Commons procedure instead. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
