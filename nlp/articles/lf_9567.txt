Cabinet minister Gillian Keegan says the UK government is "very, very concerned" by reports a British aid worker has been killed in Gaza. The education secretary told BBC Breakfast: "We haven't had it confirmed yet, but we are very, very concerned by the situation. "We do know that we've urged Israel to do more to protect civilians, but also to allow aid to get into Gaza. "But, we haven't yet had this confirmed and I think the IDF are reviewing this, probably as we speak. " Separately, we have just heard from the UK Foreign Office too. We are aware of reports of the death of a British national in Gaza and are urgently seeking further information. " Foreign Office. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
