T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. A former UK ambassador to Lebanon says the assassination of Saleh al-Arouri, Hamas's deputy leader is a "moment of real jeopardy". Tom Fletcher was speaking on Radio 4's Today programme. He says al-Arouri was a "big fish" and "taking  him out in the heart of Hezbollah territory is a big deal". Fletcher goes on to say Lebanon and Israel will be "braced" and worried about "a miscalculation drawing them deeper into the conflict". He describes Hezbollah as more battle-hardened than Hamas and says any significant escalation in tensions across the Lebanon-Israel border would be "grim". For that reason he says Israel are strongly emphasising this was an attack on an individual Hamas leader not against Hezbollah or Lebanon. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
