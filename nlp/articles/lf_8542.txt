We're still waiting for a readout of the call that's taken place between Joe Biden and Benjamin Netanyahu - until then, here are five things the US president said earlier this week about the Israeli strike that killed seven aid workers in Gaza: Biden said he was "outraged and heartbroken" at Israel's killing of the World Central Kitchen employees. Distributing aid in Gaza is "so difficult", he said, because Israel had "not done enough to protect aid workers trying to deliver desperately needed help to civilians" He called on Israel to swiftly conduct an investigation that "must bring accountability" , and make its findings public. "The United States has repeatedly urged Israel to deconflict their military operations against Hamas with humanitarian operations, in order to avoid civilian casualties," he said. Biden also accused Israel of not doing enough to protect Palestinian civilians in Gaza. Read more about Biden's comments here . T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
