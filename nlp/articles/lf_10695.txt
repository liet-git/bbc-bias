As Israel and Hamas continue to battle in the Gaza Strip, more than two months after the 7 October attacks. Here are some of the main developments from today: Israel      is continuing its bombardment of the Gaza Strip, with much of the focus on      the southern city of Khan Younis. Air strikes are also being conducted      further south, in Rafah near the Egyptian border. Hamas officials say 22      people were killed there. The      World Health Organization says less than a third of Gaza's hospitals      remain functional , and those only partially so. The WHO's Richard Peeperkorn said "we cannot afford to lose any [more] health care facilities or hospitals" People in Gaza are enduring      "hell on earth" , the head of the UN’s agency for Palestinian      refugees has said after visiting the enclave. The UN says aid distribution      in much of the territory has stopped. Meanwhile, at least four      people have been killed in Jenin in the occupied West Bank , with witnesses saying they      were hit in a drone strike. Israel’s army is also operating inside      Jenin Camp , with residents sharing videos of heavily-armed soldiers      walking through the streets. The      US has said it is pressing Israel to put "a premium on civilian life". A State Department      official said more can be done to ensure civilians reach safety, and that      Israel can achieve a “strategic victory” if it protects civilians      and works towards long-term peace.
