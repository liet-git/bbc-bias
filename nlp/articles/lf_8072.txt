T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Let's bring you some more details on what Stephen Flynn just said in the House of Commons - calling for a vote on the Speaker at the "earliest possible effect". "We saw the best in this House in its ability to debate and we also saw the worst of this House as it descended into farce," he told Parliament. "I think I speak for everyone in the chamber now, and indeed yesterday, when I express my deep sorrow that was able to happen given the content we were debating. "Nevertheless, Mr Speaker, it descended into farce because of a decision you made, and you alone made to ignore the advice given to you by the clerks. "In doing so on the opposition day of the SNP, my colleagues and I were denied the ability to vote on a matter which is of grave concern to us and which, over recent months, we have sought to raise in this Chamber at every available opportunity. "It ultimately turned into a Labour opposition day - that quite frankly is not acceptable. " Flynn says he expressed privately to the Speaker, as he told Parliament, he and his SNP colleagues "do not have confidence" in Sir Lindsay Hoyle's ability to continue in his role. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
