Sunak says there are three vital steps to put the Middle East on a "better path". First, he says regional security must be upheld, including in the Red Sea. He says Israel's security is non-negotiable and reiterates that Israel has the UK's full support. Secondly, the UK must invest more deeply in the two-state solution, he says, adding that the government has been working closely with the Palestinian Authority so that when the time comes, "they can provide more effective governance for Gaza and the West Bank". Thirdly, Sunak says, the conflict in Gaza must end. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
