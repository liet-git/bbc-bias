Eleven-year old Sarah Amer, who also spoke to the BBC's Gaza Lifeline , remembers playing in the amusement park and riding on swings during Eid last year. "Now, everything has changed and we no longer feel the joyful atmosphere of a feast. Eid has not come at all. "There is no Eid, instead there are dead people, wounded, and injured. This is a holiday of war, so how can we rejoice and celebrate when there are people being killed, prisoners, and wounded?" And Tala Abu Amr, 7, "misses the taste of happiness". "There is no Eid, no Ramadan, we miss the joyful atmosphere of Eid, and we do not feel alive at all," she says. Sarah Amer is 11 years old. Tala Abu Amr is 7 years old. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
