T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. An Iranian TV news presenter who was stabbed outside his home in London last month says he thinks Iran's Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) should be proscribed as a terrorist organisation in the UK. Iran International presenter Pouria Zeraati, 36, was attacked by a group outside his home in Wimbledon, south London. A spokesperson for Iran International says the IRGC - a major military, political and economic force in Iran - has been targeting journalists and their families. Counter-terrorism officers are leading the investigation, while the Iran has denied any involvement. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Zeraati says that what happened to him, together with Iran's attempts to "destabilise the peace and prosperity in the Middle East" and the suppression of anti-government protests inside Iran, are some of the reasons "they can be considered as a terrorist organisation". His comments come as British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak faced renewed pressure to proscribe the IRGC as a terrorist organisation after Iran's attack on Israel. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
