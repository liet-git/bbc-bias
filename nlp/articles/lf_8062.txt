A Conservative MP who signed the early day motion expressing no confidence in Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has told the BBC yesterday's chaotic scenes in the Commons reminded him of "the Brexit years" Derek Thomas, the MP for St Ives, told Radio 4's World at One programme that he recalled that time as a period "where Parliament just wasn't functioning". "So much of that was because the speaker at the time just tended to veer away from what would have been described as the normal way of running things in the House of Commons," he said. Thomas said he felt Hoyle had "taken away" the SNP's right to hold its debate. Asked if he believed that Hoyle had been pressured by Labour, Thomas replied, "I don't know what went on. I just don't understand why he took that decision", adding that Hoyle "seemed to lack judgement". T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
