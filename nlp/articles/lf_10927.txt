In six months since the deadly Hamas attacks of 7 October in Israel, tens of thousands of lives have been lost as the conflict rages on. Last October, hundreds of Hamas gunmen stormed southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking more than 250 others hostage. The attack triggered the Israeli offensive in Gaza - Israel launched air strikes in the days that followed and expanded into a ground offensive three weeks later. Much of the Gaza Strip has been devastated by the Israeli military since. The grim anniversary comes as the war in Gaza continues - more than 33,137 people have been killed in Gaza, and tens of thousands injured by Israeli strikes since the start of the war, the Hamas-run health ministry says. It says most were women and children. Israel is under growing pressure from the international community over the humanitarian situation in Gaza where the UN estimates 1.1 million people - half the population - are facing catastrophic hunger.
