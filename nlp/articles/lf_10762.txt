Donoghue speaks next about the context that has led to South Africa's application to the court. She speaks of the 7 October attack, in which Hamas killed more than 1,200 people, injured thousands and took about 240 people hostage - many of whom are still captive. Israel then began its military operation, she continues, causing massive civilian casualties, extensive damage to Gaza and displacing the overwhelming majority of the population. She notes the court is "deeply concerned" by the continuing loss of life and human suffering. She says that the scope of the present case is limited, and that South Africa and Israel are both parties to the Genocide Convention. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
