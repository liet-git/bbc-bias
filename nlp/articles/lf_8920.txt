T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Russia's UN ambassador has condemned what he termed "shameful, cynical and irresponsible" conduct by the US for previously vetoing the Security Council's draft resolutions. Ambassador Vasily Alekseyevich Nebenzya accused the US of "avoiding responsibility" and purposely "dragging out the negotiating process" to "avoid responsibility".
