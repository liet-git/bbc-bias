Dozens of mourners have gathered in southern Gaza for the funeral of Al Jazeera journalist and cameraman, Samer Abudaqa, who was killed on Friday in an Israeli strike. Abudaqa was reporting from a school in Khan Younis, a city in the south of the Gaza Strip where Israel has been intensifying its bombardment, when an Israeli drone struck the school, Al Jazeera said. Abudaqa was there with his colleague, Wael Dahdouh, who survived the attack but needed treatment for wounds caused by shrapnel. Following Abudaqa's death, Al Jazeera issued a statement saying that they held Israel â€œfully responsible" and accused it of a "systematic targeting" of its employees and their families.
