A video that emerged yesterday on social media showing dozens of Palestinian men detained by Israeli forces has been verified by the BBC. The footage shows them stripped to their underwear, kneeling on the ground and being guarded by Israeli soldiers. The men are thought to have been arrested in Beit Lahia, in the far north of the Gaza Strip. A local media outlet says one of the men is a respected journalist. Other images show them being transported in military trucks. Another shot - which has not yet been verified by the BBC - shows men blindfolded, kneeling in what appears to be a large pit of bulldozed sand. In Israeli media, the captives are being described as Hamas fighters who have surrendered. The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) has not directly commented on the images, but spokesman Daniel Hagari said on Thursday that "IDF fighters and Shin Bet officers detained and interrogated hundreds of terror suspects".
