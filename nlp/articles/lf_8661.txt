Lebanon’s Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib has told The World Tonight on Radio 4 that Israel is responsible for an attack on a senior Hamas leader in Beirut, calling it an Israeli attempt to expand its war against Hamas in Gaza into a “regional war”. Bou Habib says that Western countries have been asking Lebanon to stop Hezbollah from causing any problems, but added that “the problems are coming from Israel”. “And that’s what we are afraid of, that Israel, in order to compensate for its failures in Gaza is trying to expand the war,” he says. When asked to respond to Israel’s failure to confirm responsibility for the attack, Bou Habib said: “Of course they did it, who else would do it?”. In a media briefing earlier, IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari wouldn’t comment directly on the killing of Saleh al-Arouri, but did say the Israeli military was in a state of high alert. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
