T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Salah Ahmed, 41, is a tech entrepreneur who runs a hub in Rafah that allows people to access the internet so that they can work for companies abroad . He fled Gaza City in the early days of the war - first to Nuseirat and then to Rafah - with his two teenage daughters and eight-year-old son. He's tells us how he's been trying to make resources last: Every day begins the same for me: I wake up at 06:00, attend to household needs like groceries and water, and then head to the tech hub I set up to start my workday. Currently, prices are very high, and numerous items like meat and sugar are unavailable. I can afford the expensive items because I earn money as a freelancer and a company owner. But my situation differs from that of 99% of the people here. I'm striving to ensure my children's comfort, but my earnings will soon run out. I'll need to start seeking assistance. About 99% of the people here in Gaza Strip relies on free water supply and aid. They get food from schools or aid centres. Some of them sell these items to get cash. Those with financial means opt to buy these items to avoid being in queues, as it preserves their dignity. Meanwhile, police cars have been targeted by the IDF, and numerous armed individuals are posing threats to people's lives. Personally, I refrain from visiting any aid centres. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
