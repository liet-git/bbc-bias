Khan, 54, is a leading British barrister and King's Counsel who was elected to his role in the ICC in 2021. He has been a human rights lawyer focused on international criminal law for 30 years and is only the third chief prosecutor in the ICC's 18-year history. Prior to his election at the ICC, he led a UN investigation that targeted perpetrators of IS atrocities in Iraq and served as an Assistant Secretary-General of the UN. Before that he worked on the prosecution of crimes in the International Criminal Tribunals committed in the wars in the former Yugoslavia and the Rwandan genocide. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
