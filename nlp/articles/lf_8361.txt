Israel’s prisons are running out of space amid a surge of arrests following Hamas’s 7 October attacks and Israel’s retaliation in Gaza. A senior Israel Prison Service (IPS) official revealed on Monday that Israel had imprisoned more than 3,000 people since 7 October, according to a press release by the Knesset . “We are very close to exhausting the space for inmates in prisons,” said Elyasaf Zakai, head of the IPS' Incarceration Branch. There are 19,372 inmates in Israeli prisons currently, compared with 16,353 before 7 October, he said. “The Israel prison service knows how to cope with imprisonment of 20,000 inmates at most, and we are very close to this number,” Zakai added. It is unclear how many of those held are Palestinian but Israel is estimated by human rights groups to be holding thousands of Palestinians – in some cases without charge . Typically Israel releases hundreds, sometimes thousands, of Palestinians in return for Israeli hostages. The seven-day ceasefire brokered last month saw Hamas release 105 hostages, while Israel freed 240 Palestinians from jail. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
