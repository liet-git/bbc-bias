Earlier, we told you about two charities that have pledged to continue their operations in Gaza. Others, however, have decided to pause their work over security concerns. Health charity Project Hope says that it will pause its work in Deir al-Balah and Rafah for the next three days "in solidarity with World Central Kitchen" while it reassesses the security situation. The humanitarian relief organisation has also called for an "immediate and permanent ceasefire" to allow groups such as themselves to "safely provide lifesaving care". This arrives just one day after World Central Kitchen and another US charity it works with, American Near East Refugee Aid (ANERA), announced they would be pausing their operations in the Strip.
