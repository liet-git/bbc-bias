The UK's representative has explained why it abstained from voting for the ceasefire resolution. They say the UK could not "vote in favour of a resolution that does not condemn the atrocities Hamas committed" against Israelis on 7 October. "Israel needs to be able to address the threat posed by Hamas", the representative says, but adds Israel must abide by international law. The UK did call for further and longer humanitarian pauses to get aid to Palestinians and free Israeli hostages held by Hamas. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
