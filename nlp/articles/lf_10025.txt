Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari has just held a press conference in Tel Aviv saying Israel is still on high alert and has approved defensive and offensive plans. He talked about Iran's attack last night saying "approximately 350 suicide drones, cruise missiles, ballistic missiles and rockets" were launched. Hagari added approximately 60 tonnes of "warheads and explosives" were attached to the missiles and drones. "Together we thwarted Iran's attack," Hagari said - praising a coalition of allied nations for helping Israel defend itself from 99% of the bombardment. "This was the first time that such a coalition worked together against the threat of Iran," he added. He ended by saying that Israel had not lost sight of what he called the country's mission in Gaza - where Israel has been attempting to destroy the Palestinian armed group Hamas and free hostages taken by the group when it attacked Israeli communities last October, killing about 1,200 mainly civilians.
