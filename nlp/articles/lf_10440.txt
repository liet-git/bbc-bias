A week ago Columbia Universityâ€™s president called in police to clear pro-Palestinian protesters from the campus in New York City. Since then increasingly tense demonstrations have spread to universities across the country. "The tides have shifted," says master's student Basil, a protester at Columbia University. The Columbia University Apartheid Divest organiser says students are now willing to put their careers and even bodies at stake "for the bombs to stop dropping immediately and for our institutions to stop making money off of bombs". "We're mobilised to continue going. " Darializa tells the BBC she is proud of the students. She has graduated, but returned for the demonstration, whose participants, she says, are "determined to remain" until their demands are met. "They are stubborn," she adds.
