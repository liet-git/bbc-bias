We’ve been hearing from some of the 600,000 children sheltering in the city of Rafah about their fears of coming under attack and the destruction that awaits them in their hometowns. The Israeli military previously told people across Gaza to evacuate to Rafah, declaring it a safe zone, but now appears to be planning to enter the city, saying an offensive is necessary to eliminate Hamas. Saad Ouda, 14, is originally from Khan Younis and told BBC Arabic that he hoped to return there, even if his house is no longer standing. “Go to Khan Younis and you will find everything destructed, all our houses have been destroyed,” he said. “And yet I would rather sit on the remains of my house rather than sitting in Rafah. “My siblings are scared and crying. My only wish in life is to go back home and live in peace. Enough humiliation and enough bombardment. “We sleep here in Rafah with our eyes open. The forces told us to go to Rafah [and] that it is a safe zone but it is completely unsafe. ”. He said that, for him and the other children of Gaza, “life has been a constant war ever since we were born”. “What can we do? We as children in Gaza didn't have the privilege to enjoy life like children in the rest of the world. Nothing, no games, no water, no food,” he said. “We are always suffocating and trapped and our life is unlike the rest of the world. We have been at war for six months and not a single passing day was good. “Everything is war. Our eyes don’t shut, nor do we sleep like other people, nor is their food, nor is this our life. ”.
