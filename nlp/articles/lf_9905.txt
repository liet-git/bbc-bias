A doctor in Rafah says people in the city are terrified about the prospect of an Israeli ground operation, after a night of some of the worst air strikes he has experienced in the city since arriving there. Dr Ahmed Abuibaid told the BBC the "most popular question on peopleâ€™s minds is, where can we go?". He says the sense of desperation is heightened by the fact Rafah was seen as the only safe place left in the Gaza Strip. He himself was forced to abandon his job in Khan Younis' Nasser Hospital, after his home was destroyed in an Israeli air strike and his dad suffered a traumatic spine injury. The medic says the humanitarian situation in the border city is worsening by the day, with little access to water or food, and rapidly dwindling medical supplies. Many people are living in tents, but many more are sleeping in the streets due to overcrowding, he says. "I see a lot of diseases among people here, like urinary tract infections and dermatological diseases" exacerbated by the "severe decrease in the availability of drugs and treatment". In a series of messages sent by phone overnight, Dr Abuibaid described the air strikes as incessant and everywhere. "People don't know what to do,"  he wrote, at 03:00 local time. People trying to escape from rockets - to the schools, ambulances - can't move due to the continuous bombing, and the children are very scared. " Dr Ahmed Abuibaid.
