The University of Southern California has cancelled its main commencement ceremony scheduled for 10 May. "With the new safety measures in place this year, the time needed to process the large number of guests coming to campus will increase substantially," the university said in a statement. "As a result, we will not be able to host the main stage ceremony that traditionally brings 65,000 students, families, and friends to our campus. " The decision comes after police made multiple arrests after confronting protesters there on Wednesday and ordering the dismantling of a campus encampment. It is also after USC said earlier this month that Muslim student Asna Tabassum would no longer be permitted to deliver a speech as valedictorian due to unspecified security threats. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
