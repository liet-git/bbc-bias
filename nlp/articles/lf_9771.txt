Dr Mohammed Obeid, a consultant orthopaedic surgeon in Al-Awda Hospital, northern Gaza, says medical workers in Gaza are experiencing "weight loss and muscle weakness" due to a lack of nutrition. His comments follow a new report backed by the UN, which says famine is expected between now and May in the north of the Gaza Strip. "They consistently experience low energy levels, impacting their productivity at work and [they] will not be able to last all day long," Dr Obeid tells charity ActionAid. Speaking about those observing Ramadan, he says most weren't able to "have a proper Iftar meal to break our fast". "Providing food, whether for patients or doctors, is extremely challenging. " Food items are being sold at prices up to 100 times higher than their original cost, he adds. "The market does not provide many supplies of any kind, even when you have the money, you still can't obtain a meal for yourself, your children, or even the medical staff," Dr Obeid says.
