We've been hearing voices from Gaza discussing the difficulties people with disabilities are facing because of the war. Safa Jalal, 28, who has a visual disability, says she is dependent on her hearing when explosions hit. "When explosions take place, I cannot see anything, but only hear sounds, and I do not know where I am at the time," Safa told the BBC World Service. "I would like this war to come to an end so that my life goes back to normal, I hope my tragedy ends," she said. The UN warned earlier in the conflict that about 15% of the displaced people inside the Gaza Strip have a disability and shelters are not well equipped to meet their needs. Youssef Ali Abu Khater said his sister, who is deaf and unable to speak, refused to flee to Khan Younis with his family. They have been unable to locate her since. "She was very tired as she was facing a great difficulty in doing anything," he said. "She only wanted to stay at her home. Her family did not want to abandon her, so they asked her to come with them, but she left them and went in the direction of bombing and fighting. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
