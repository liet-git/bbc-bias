Lena Shakora has left her home in northern Gaza for the centre of the territory and is now staying in a home with 40 people. “All the houses are full and you are constantly sitting in fear of bombardment,” she tells BBC Arabic, describing every day as a “nightmare”. “I wake up every day remembering that we are at war. People are starving - it’s torture to be displaced from your home and to have no food. ”. She adds that her husband is well-off financially, but there is no food to buy for her sons. “The shops are empty, there are no goods inside. We don’t see the aid that enters,” she says. She says her sons are suffering from back pain because of the amount of water they have been having to carry, because of shortages. “Please, please call for a ceasefire. We don’t need anything. We are ready to go back to our homes and sit in tents on the ruins, but please stop the constant fear we are living in. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
