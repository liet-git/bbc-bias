T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Monday’s strike on an aid convoy in Gaza “proves yet again that there is no safe place” in the territory, a spokeswoman for charity Medical Aid for Palestinians (MAP) said. “Whether you are Palestinian, British, or any other nationality, Gaza is the most dangerous place in the world now to be an aid worker,” Aseel Baidoun told the BBC. In January, a compound housing staff from MAP and other aid groups was hit by an Israeli strike, injuring a number of people and forcing the organisation to relocate to another site in Gaza. Asked whether she believed Israel was deliberately targeting aid convoys, Baidoun said she remained “uncertain” but called on the Israeli government to provide “transparency”. “We just need a clear explanation. We just need a clear assurance that this will not happen again. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
