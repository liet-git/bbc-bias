A New York Police Department chief has hit back at Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez after the Democratic congresswoman criticised Columbia University for calling in police to clear protesters from its campus. In a post on X, Ocasio-Cortez, the representative for New York's 14th congressional district, described Columbia's decision as "horrific", adding that the units called in "have some of the most violent reputations on the force". Responding on X, NYPD chief of patrol John Snell said the left-wing lawmaker's post was "Truly amazing!" He added: "The only incidents that day on campus were the student's hateful anti-Semitic speech  and vile language towards our cops. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
