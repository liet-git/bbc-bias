We're still listening in to that White House news conference we mentioned in our last post - where John Kirby's continuing to answer questions from reporters. Kirby's just been explaining to those gathered that what Hamas says it's accepted - and Israel says it's reviewing - may not necessarily be a final ceasefire deal. “We get a response by Hamas, we’re going to evaluate that. The Israelis must have a chance to look at this," he says. Kirby goes on to say that discussions are taking place with regional partners: “I’m sure we’d all like to have an answer as soon as possible, but I don’t want to get ahead of that process. ”.
