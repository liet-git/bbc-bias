T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. A security analyst has said the withdrawal of Israeli military from Khan Younis could make any ground offensive in Rafah less "contentious". Justin Crump, chief executive of the defence and intelligence company Sibylline, told the BBC's World at One programme the withdrawal could alleviate the "pressure cooker of humanitarian problems" in Rafah. "[The Israelis] moving away from Khan Younis and other places allows, if you like, some of the population pressure to disperse from Rafah - and will actually make Israeli operations there both less contentious and arguably easier in the coming weeks. " Israel has long warned of a planned ground offensive in the southern city of Rafah, where more than a million displaced Palestinians are sheltering, in order to rout out Hamas units it says are based there. Crump said he believed Israel had not "given up on Rafah" and its planned offensive, with forces likely to be recuperating and mulling their next stage of operations. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
