The armed wing of Hamas has released a video which it says shows the bloody aftermath of a failed Israeli operation to free an Israeli hostage. In the video, a man identifies himself as a hostage - he gives his name and age, which we are withholding - who has been held for 40 days, suggesting the video may have been recorded in mid-November. The video goes on to show a lot of blood on a tiled floor and steps, followed by a collection of military equipment, including a shotgun, grenades and rucksacks, which Hamas claims to have captured. The video ends with gruesome images of a bloodied body that appears to be that of the same hostage seen earlier. A script in Arabic says that Israeli soldiers “failed to reach” the hostage, leading to his death, and that the Israeli team “quickly fled the place. ” It claims that the IDF used an ambulance to reach the place where the hostage was being held. There is absolutely no confirmation of any of this. In his evening briefing tonight, Daniel Hagari, the chief Israeli Defence Force (IDF) spokesman, confirmed that two Israeli soldiers were seriously wounded during operations in Gaza to free hostages. He said “terrorists who participated in the kidnapping and holding of hostages” had been killed, but he said no hostages had been released. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
