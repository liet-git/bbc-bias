As Israel's military continues to target the south of the Gaza Strip in its efforts to defeat Hamas, here's a selection of images from there this morning. Further air strikes have targeted Khan Younis, the main city in southern Gaza. A nursery in Rafah, near the border with Egypt, was also hit by missiles early on Saturday. Wounded children at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis today. The images - like this one of people salvaging wood in Rafah - come after a US veto defeated a resolution for a ceasefire in Gaza held by the UN Security Council. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
