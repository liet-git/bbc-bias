T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. We can bring you more now on the Israeli position on the ceasefire deal offered by Qatari and Egyptian mediators, which Hamas said yesterday it was prepared to accept. An Israeli official briefed on the talks says a mid-level Israeli delegation is due to hold talks in Cairo this evening. The delegation is there to see if they can negotiate some "new answers", the official says. According to the official, there are four aspects of the proposal that Hamas has agreed to which Israel takes issue with: The document refers to the end of the war, described as a permanent ceasefire, according to the official. They believe it would see female soldiers released too late in the process. They say the document references a contingency that if 33 living hostages cannot be found for the first phase, then bodies can be substituted instead, which the Israeli official said was unacceptable. Israel believes it would be obliged to release an agreed number of prisoners from a list that Hamas will provide, with no power of veto for any individual case. A reminder - we have not had confirmation from Hamas or the mediators as to what is included in the deal currently on the table. We do know that Israel also already dismissed it as "far from meeting" its "core demands". T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
