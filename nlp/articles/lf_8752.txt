The Israeli military says it is investigating the possibility that Sunday's deadly blaze at a camp for displaced people in Rafah, was caused by a weapons store being hit by its air strike. Dozens of Palestinians were killed in the attack which has led to widespread international condemnation. Responding to Israel's claims, Husam Zomlot, the head of the Palestinian Mission to the UK, told the BBC: "This is lying. And they have been lying all along. There were air strikes on an area that Israel knows very well that it is a safe zone for people taking shelter in Rafah. "In fact, it was the Israeli army who directed people to go to al-Mawasi, the very area they bombarded in the weekend, on Sunday, and they bombarded again today, killing and injuring dozens of civilians. The images are gut-wrecking really, it's heart-breaking. " Israel is yet to publicly respond to Zomlot's comments. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
