If you're just joining us or need a recap, here's a quick round up of the latest developments: The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has said more than 20,000 people have been killed in the territory since 7 October - when Israel began its retaliatory operation in response to the Hamas attacks on Israel. In New York, a vote on a draft UN Security Council motion calling for “urgent and extended humanitarian pauses” in Gaza has been postponed again. This follows days of tense diplomatic wrangling over the language of the text, with the main sticking point said to be over the monitoring of humanitarian aid entering Gaza. Badly wounded children in Gaza’s al-Aqsa hospital have told the BBC’s Fergal Keane about their fears for the present and the future. Israeli air strikes and clashes with Hamas continue around the territory - including attacks in the southern city of Rafah , near the border with Egypt. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has  pushed back on criticism of the White House's support for Israel, calling for a strong international voice to condemn Hamas. Hamas’s leader, Ismail Haniyeh, has travelled to Egypt, which together with Qatar mediated the last truce deal. That truce led to Hamas freeing some hostages from Gaza, and Israel released some Palestinian prisoners from its jails. The White House has said "very serious discussions and negotiations" are under way. Meanwhile Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel will fight on until Hamas is eliminated. Families of people killed and taken hostage from Kibbutz Be’eri in the Hamas attacks say their home was “turned into hell” by the brutality of 7 October. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
