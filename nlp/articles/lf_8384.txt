T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. I was reporting from near the Kuwaiti Hospital in Rafah when I saw at least six missiles being dropped from Israeli fighter jets. The bombardment was heavy and sudden. The ground shook underneath me and clouds of smoke filled the air. I rushed to the scene, there was panic and dust everywhere. People were running around, women were screaming. One child was walking around dazed. He appeared to be looking for someone. An older woman was helped down the street, visibly in shock. Eyewitnesses have told me there were many casualties and some are still trapped under the rubble. Ambulances started rushing to the scene as I was filming. The Hamas-run health ministry later said at least 12 people were killed. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
