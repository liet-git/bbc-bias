It's just gone 00:30 in Israel and Gaza and 22:30 in London. Here is a brief summary of where things stand tonight: The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) says it mistakenly killed three hostages -Yotam Haim, Samer Talalka and Alon Shamriz - during its campaign in Gaza, after misidentifying them as a "threat" The bodies of three more hostages - two Israeli soldiers, Nik Beizer and Ron Scherman, and civilian Elia Toledano - were recovered from Gaza by the IDF earlier. Rocket attacks were launched against Jerusalem for the first time since 30 October; all were intercepted by the Iron Dome defence system. White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan met with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, who said Gaza must remain an "integral part" of the Palestinian state. Israel said it will allow aid to pass through the Kerem Shalom checkpoint into Gaza for the first time since the war began on 7 October â€“ the crossing is usually for goods. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
