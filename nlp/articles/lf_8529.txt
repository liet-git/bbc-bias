T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. US officials approved the transfer of "thousands more bombs" to Israel on the same day Israeli air strikes in Gaza killed seven aid workers, the Washington Post reports, citing anonymous government officials. The deaths of the World Central Kitchen aid workers - in an attack that the charity group's founder, Jose Andr√©s, said was "targeted systematically" - has drawn global condemnation. The arms approval highlights the Biden administration's commitment to providing military aid to Israel - despite growing calls for a ceasefire and the thousands of Democrats who have submitted protest votes against President Biden, frustrated by his military aid support sent to Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu. The US approved the transfer of more than 2,000 bombs, all from authorisations granted by Congress several years before the Israel-Gaza war began, according to the Post.
