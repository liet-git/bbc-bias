T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Unicef has warned that at least 10,000 children in Gaza face life-threatening forms of malnutrition in the coming weeks amid "catastrophic" conditions. The statement comes one day after the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) warned that one in four households in Gaza face acute food insecurity, the highest level of warning. â€œThese entirely manmade, foreseeable, and preventable catastrophic conditions mean that children and families in the Gaza Strip are now facing violence from the air, and deprivation from the ground - with potentially the worst yet to come," Unicef said. According to Unicef estimates, about 10,000 children under the age of five will face severe wasting - the most dangerous form of malnutrition - and will need therapeutic foods. "We are also particularly concerned about the nutrition of over 155,000 pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers, as well as for over 135,000 children under two, given their specific nutrition needs, which are compounded by stress and trauma," the statement added. More than 1.2m people are experiencing acute food security in Gaza, according to Unicef. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
