The explicit invoking of Article 99 by a secretary general has only happened nine times, and it's been decades since. The UN for weeks has been urgently warning about the unfolding humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza and now Antonio Guterres is activating one of his most powerful distress signals. It was done - the UN said - given the scale of the loss of life in Gaza and Israel in such a short amount of time. This dramatic move by the UN chief is also a powerful expression of his frustration with the Security Council and a reminder to them of their responsibilities. He wants to push the Security Council to call for a humanitarian ceasefire and to meet as early as this week. The majority of council members support a ceasefire but crucially the United States, Israelâ€™s ally and a permanent veto-wielding member, does not. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
