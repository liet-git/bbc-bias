The seven aid workers from the World Central Kitchen are sadly not the first to have been killed during the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, which began almost six months ago. “Nowhere else are so many aid workers killed. There must be an immediate ceasefire. Enough now,” wrote Jan Egeland, the head of the Norwegian Refugee Council and a former UN humanitarian chief following Monday’s deadly air strike. Before the incident, at least 196 aid workers had been killed in the Palestinian territories since the start of the war, according to a tally by the Aid Worker Security Database , which records major incidents of violence against humanitarian personnel. Last year, when 161 aid workers were reported killed, was the deadliest year ever recorded, according to the AWSD’s database. Most of those killed during the war worked for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), which runs the biggest aid operation in Gaza. UNRWA said in a report on Monday that 173 of its staff members had been killed, including while in the line of duty. It added that 353 “incidents impacting UNRWA premises and the people inside them” had been reported during the war, including “at least 52 incidents of military use and/or interference at UNRWA premises”.
