Well, as MPs debate on a Gaza ceasefire call, here's a chance to break down some of the terminology you're hearing: The House of Commons is expected to vote later this evening on a call - or motion - submitted by the Scottish National Party (SNP) for MPs to back an immediate ceasefire. Before voting begins, other parties can put forward their own position, which might suggest changes to the language or conditions of the SNP’s original motion. This is called an amendment. Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has chosen the order in which amendments are put forward for MPs to first debate and ultimately vote on. They will be able to vote for, against or abstain.
