Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri has told Reuters news agency that Israel's evacuation order in parts of Rafah is a "dangerous escalation that will have consequences". Meanwhile Israel's foreign minister says the war in Gaza "continues with the exact same goals: the release of all hostages and the defeat of Hamas". Posting on X, Israel Katz says "Israel has agreed to significant concessions to bring the hostages home, but Hamas has repeatedly refused. " It comes after two days of talks aimed at securing a ceasefire deal in Gaza and the release of hostages concluded yesterday, with Israel and Hamas still some distance apart on how to end the seven-month conflict. Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said yesterday that “surrendering” to a Hamas demand to end the war would amount to defeat. While the head of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh accused Netanyahu of sabotaging the talks. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
