Our colleagues at BBC Arabic have been hearing from Gazans who were nearby when Israel began its raid of al-Shifa Hospital. One man, who was sheltering in al-Nasr Hospital in Gaza City, says shelling began some time around 2:30am before soldiers stormed the hospital. He says at 8:00am the bombing grew in intensity. He and others eventually escaped down side streets, and described coming under fire as they fled. A woman who was also at al-Nasr with her children said violent clashes echoed through the night. She expected the bombardment to subside in the morning, but she says the shelling continued. "I did not know where to go or where to seek shelter. There was no longer a safe place to go to. All the places have been bombed," she says. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
