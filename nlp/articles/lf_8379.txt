As we've just reported, Hamas authorities say that more than 20,000 have now been killed in Gaza. Death toll figures usually come from the Hamas-run health ministry in the territory, rather than the government media office, which put out the announcement today. Israel and the US have previously cast doubt on the numbers Hamas's ministry publishes. But international organisations, including the UN's World Heath Organization (WHO), have said they have no reason to disbelieve them. The numbers killed in Gaza could also be higher, given the difficulty of accurately collecting data in a war zone. It is also not clear, as health ministry officials regularly say, how many people are buried beneath the rubble of buildings destroyed in Israeli air strikes. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
