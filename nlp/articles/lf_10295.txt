T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Fedaa Shallen, a displaced Palestinian woman, is one of those who found themselves stuck in Rafah after the border was closed when Israeli troops took control of the Palestinian side of the crossing between Gaza and Egypt. She had been waiting to leave Gaza via the crossing to seek medical treatment for her daughter. “I have a transfer permit for my daughter so that she can have an operation abroad," she says. "I have been waiting but now the border is shut. "We don’t know what to do. I want to know, is our right less than those in other countries?" She adds that children in Gaza "are not living their childhood". An IDF official said the Rafah crossing was closed and that it was working to reopen Kerem Shalom once the security situation allowed it. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
