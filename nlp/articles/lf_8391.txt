T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. We've just had the text for the UN Security Council draft resolution about the war in Gaza, which is due to be voted on later today. There have been days of diplomatic wrangling in New York over the precise wording of the document, leading to this vote being repeatedly delayed since Monday. The language in the UAE's proposal has reportedly already been watered down in an attempt to get around a potential veto of the draft, after the US blocked previous resolutions using its powers as one of the five permanent members of the Security Council. The resolution calls for: The parties of the conflict in Gaza to comply with their obligations under international law , regarding the protection of civilians. Urgent and extended humanitarian pauses and corridors throughout the Gaza Strip for a sufficient number of days to enable full, rapid, safe, and unhindered humanitarian access. The immediate and unconditional release of all hostages , as well as ensuring immediate humanitarian access. Reiterates the vision of the two-state solution , with the Gaza Strip as part of a Palestinian State. Also calls for all parties to "refrain from depriving the civilian population in the Gaza Strip of basic services and humanitarian assistance indispensable to their survival" T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
