As we've been discussing, President Biden says he will host a meeting of G7 leaders later on Sunday. As a reminder, here's how G7 members have been reacting to the news of the Iranian attack on Israel: UK PM Rishi Sunak has condemned the "reckless attack" in the "strongest terms". He said the strikes "risk inflaming tensions and destabilising the region", adding that Iran has "demonstrated that it is intent on sowing chaos in its own backyard". The UK will continue to stand up for Israelâ€™s security and that of all our regional partners, including Jordan and Iraq. Alongside our allies, we are urgently working to stabilise the situation and prevent further escalation. No one wants to see more bloodshed. " Canadian PM Justin Trudeau has said his country "unequivocally condemns Iran's airborne attacks", adding: "We stand with Israel. " After supporting Hamas' brutal October 7 attack, the Iranian regime's latest actions will further destabilise the region and make lasting peace more difficult. " French foreign minister Stephane Sejourne has said France "condemns in the strongest terms the attack launched by Iran against Israel". By deciding on such an unprecedented action, Iran is taking a new step in its destabilizing actions and taking the risk of a military escalation. " German ambassador to Israel Steffen Seibert said: Germany's solidarity is with all Israelis tonight whom Iran is terrorising with this unprecedented and ruthless attack: Jews as well as Arabs and Christians, the Bedouins in the Negev as well as the Druze in the Golan. May they all be safe. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
