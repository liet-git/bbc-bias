It's just past 08:00 in Israel, the morning after Iran attacked with a barrage of drones and missiles. Here are the main developments for those of you joining us in the UK and Europe. Israel says that around 300 drones and missiles were fired by Iran, and that some of the launches also came from Iraq and Yemen. The attack is a retaliation for a strike that killed an Iranian military commander and subordinates in Damascus earlier this month, that Tehran believes Israel carried out. Videos showed explosions and fireballs over Jerusalem as Israeli air defences worked to defeat Iran's unprecedented attack. The IDF said 99% of the drones or missiles were shot down before they entered Israeli airspace. President Joe Biden said the US also "helped Israel take down nearly all" of them. The UK too deployed RAF jets in the region. This is the first time Tehran has directly attacked Israel after years of waging proxy wars with its affiliates, including Hezbollah and Hamas. Iran's mission to the UN cited the UN Charter provision for self defence , under Article 51, and said that it considered the "matter. . . concluded" However it warned it would use greater force should Israel respond in kind.
