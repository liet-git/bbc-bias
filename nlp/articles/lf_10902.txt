A crowd of smiling, laughing, faces stare from fields in southern Israel. They’re photographs of the killed and kidnapped in a memorial to that fateful day when Hamas gunmen turned their celebration at the Nova Music Festival into bloodshed. More than 370 festival goers were shot, beaten, or burnt to death; more than 40 were dragged across the Gaza boundary nearby. Today, candles are being lit in the sea of Israeli flags and flowers, teddy bears, and other mementos to young lives brutally cut short.  Families who lost loved ones gathered for a press conference and prayer as buses kept pulling up, bringing students, soldiers, mourners. “Before October 7th, I could imagine peace,” reflected Shimon Buskila, whose 25-year old son Jordan perished that day. Anger still seethes over Israel’s shocking security failure, mixed with raw grief. “October 7th is a tragedy that could - and should - have been avoided. ”. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
