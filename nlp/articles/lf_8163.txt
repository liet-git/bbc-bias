T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Labour MP Apsana Begum says more than 29,000 people have now been killed in Gaza and asks if the government believes there is any limit to the "slaughter". Starving civilians, destroying schools and hospitals, and targeting refugee camps can never be a legitimate military campaign, she adds. Begum says there is a "chilling disregard" for Palestinian lives, a "dehumanisation" and racism among much of the UK's "political establishment". This means, she argues, that for many in power any expression of Palestinian identity is deemed unacceptable, while the US and the UK use their power to ensure "this nightmare continues".
