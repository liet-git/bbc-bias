Russia is calling for all parties to "show restraint" and "expressed concern" over further escalation after Iran launched missiles and drones at Israel overnight. "We are counting on the regional states to solve the existing problems with political and diplomatic means," the foreign ministry has said in a statement. Moscow added that it has warned numerous times that the UN Security Council was unable to "adequately" respond to a strike on an Iranian consulate in Syria, which killed seven officers from the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, including top commanders. It comes after the United States, Britain and France opposed a Russian-drafted UN Security Council statement that would have condemned an attack on Iran's embassy compound in Syria. Iran accused Israel of carrying out that attack, but Israel has said it doesn't comment on foreign reports. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
