T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Earlier we reported that the Israeli ambassador to the UK Tzipi Hotovely said “absolutely no” when asked if Palestinians should have their own state in any peace deal in the future. The two-state solution is the idea that establishing an independent Palestine alongside Israel would create a way for the two peoples to co-exist peacefully. Now UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron has branded her rejection of a two-state solution as "disappointing", but says "we should not put too much weight on one interview". "I think it is still possible but I think the pathway from where we are today to getting there is very, very difficult," Cameron told the European Affairs Committee in the UK's House of Lords. Earlier, he said that "extremist settlers" responsible for violence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank would no longer be permitted to come to the UK. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
