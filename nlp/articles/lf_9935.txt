We've just been hearing from Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Daniel Hagari, who says Tel Aviv must do everything necessary to protect the state "at the time and in the way we in Israel choose to do so". Hagari says the Iranian attack was "thwarted with the iron defence campaign," adding that it counted on an "unprecedented coalition" from the UK, US, France and other countries, which "not only thwarted but truly prevented that attack". At least nine countries were involved in the military escalation - with projectiles fired from Iran, Iraq, Syria and Yemen and downed by Israel, the US, the UK and Jordan. Some 99% of the incoming barrage was intercepted either outside Israeli airspace or over the country itself, Hagari has previously said. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
