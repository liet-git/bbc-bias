I've been speaking to Elham, a 40-year-old mother in the southern city of Rafah, where 1.5 million Palestinians are sheltering. Elham's home is now a mass of rubble, bar one room that survived the bombing - and that her family now lives in. I asked her how - if at all - she was marking Eid. "We have no Eid, no new clothes, no semblance of celebration," she told me. "It's a very sad day full of tears for our children who were martyred in the war, including my sister's children. " Eid-al-Fitr marks the end of the holy month of Ramadan, when Muslims fast. It's usually a day for gathering with family and eating large meals. But amid a looming famine, the situation in Gaza looks very different. Elham says she's unable to afford the little food available. "I have no food for myself," Elham says. "My children have bread and cheese, but I have nothing. " Elham's children. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
