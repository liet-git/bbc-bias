T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Let's return now to the ceasefire talks. A few moments ago we heard from the White House, which said that negotiators had presented a hostage release proposal to Hamas. "At the end of the weekend, a proposal was submitted to Hamas. And now it's going to be up to Hamas to come through," White House security advisor John Kirby said on a call to reporters on Monday, according to news agencies. Kirby added that the Hamas was currently reviewing the proposal, and that it included a ceasefire of around six weeks. He said that William Burns, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), was in Egypt over the weekend to help in those negotiations. Kirby also said that the there was no sign of a major ground operation in Rafah at the moment and that no new date had yet been set for talks with Israel on the matter. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
