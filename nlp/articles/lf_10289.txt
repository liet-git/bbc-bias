A senior Hamas official says its delegation, which is leaving for Cairo to discuss truce talks, will be Israel's "last chance" to release its hostages. Speaking anonymously to AFP news agency, the official says Hamas negotiators initially cancelled plans earlier today to travel from Qatar to the Egyptian capital. The Hamas official now says they will leave "shortly". The official says Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's "decision to invade Rafah" has indicated that he and the Israeli army had "made the decision to let the prisoners (hostages) die". "This will be the last chance for Netanyahu and the families of the Zionist prisoners to return their children," the official says. Hamas took 252 people hostage during the attacks on Israel on 7 October, 128 remain unaccounted for. Israel says it is conducting "targeted strikes" against Hamas in Rafah with the aim of finding what they call "terrorist infrastructure". T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
