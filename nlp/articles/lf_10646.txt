The heart of Gaza's southern city of Khan Younis has turned into a ghost town. Israeli tanks have not yet reached the centre of the city, but the IDF controls the area with intense fire. Musa Al-Masri, who owns a cigarette shop on the main Jalal Street, told the BBC: "I miraculously escaped death when I tried to reach my shop in the central town. A quadcopter drone fired intensely at me. I took cover behind the wall and escaped through a side road. I did not see the Israeli forces, but I felt death everywhere. " He adds that most buildings in the area are empty, including markets that were until recently packed with locals and those displaced from northern Gaza. "Now it has become completely empty since the start of the ground operation a week ago," Musa says. "Most people have fled to the city of Rafah and the western neighbourhoods of Khan Younis.
