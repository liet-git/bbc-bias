Cameron's asked what his fears would be if Israel took major retaliatory action against Iran. He says in any action taken, "there's always a danger of miscalculation". Cameron says, as an example, he'd argue that the Iranians "badly miscalculated" their strikes on Israel. He says he spoke to the Iranian foreign minister, and that Iran claims it was the "minimum they could possibly do", and that they "clearly hoped more of their weapons would get through". Israel has the right to respond, he says, but repeats that the UK thinks this should be avoided. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
