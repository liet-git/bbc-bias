I have been visiting the only dialysis centre in the south of Gaza - a small department trying hard to save patients’ lives. But with the war still raging, many dialysis patients displaced from across the Strip have had to come here, adding to the pressure on doctors. “Our department used to handle a maximum of around 120 to 125 patients at most here in Rafah,” the director of the dialysis department, Dr Mohammed Abi Saalik, tells me. “Now, there are over 300 patients coming to our department. . . we only have around 16 machines, those machines cannot take this high demand,” he adds. To ensure all patients receive treatment, doctors have had to make adjustments. I come across 13-year-old Yehia al-Samna, who fled from Gaza City with his family. His worried mother explains that her son's usual three sessions a week have been reduced to two, and the length halved from four hours to "about two hours". My son used to leave dialysis sessions feeling healthy and full of energy. He now finishes the session and its as though he’s done nothing. ”. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
