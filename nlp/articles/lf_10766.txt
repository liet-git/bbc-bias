The majority of Gaza's population of 2.3 million people are displaced and fight daily to find food, drink and medicine as Israel's offensive continues in the wake of Hamas's attacks on 7 October. Efforts involving several countries to try to reach a ceasefire are ongoing, and South Africa hopes its case in the ICJ will halt Israel's military operations in Gaza. A final decision on South Africa's genocide allegations - which Israel strongly denies - are not expected for several years. The case also seeks to highlight the suffering of Palestinians, and the nine "provisional measures" which South Africa wants the ICJ to impose aim "to protect against further, severe and irreparable harm to the rights of the Palestinian people". Israeli lawyers have argued that while civilian suffering in Gaza was "tragic", Hamas sought "to maximise civilian harm to both Israelis and Palestinians, even as Israel seeks to minimise it". Earlier today, the UN rights office warned that relentless attacks against infrastructure in Gaza were making the Palestinian enclave "completely uninhabitable". More than 570,000 people in Gaza face "catastrophic hunger," the UN said this week. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
