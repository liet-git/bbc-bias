It's been a few hours since we first heard reports that more than 100 Palestinians had been killed in a crowd near a convoy that was attempting to deliver aid in northern Gaza. Since then, there's been a fast-flow of information to digest - and various accounts of what happened from Hamas, the Israeli military and eyewitnesses - so if you're coming to this page fresh, here's a rundown of what we now know to have happened: A little after 04:00 local time (02:00 GMT) on Thursday, a convoy of trucks carrying humanitarian aid passed an Israeli checkpoint on the edge of Gaza City. Crowds of civilians then descended on the convoy, trying to grab anything they could. Remember, Gaza City has had almost no aid for weeks. Israeli troops, manning the checkpoint, shot at some of the crowd because troops believed they posed a threat - but the IDF says it was a "limited response" The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says 112 Palestinians were killed - it has blamed Israeli forces with Palestinian media citing medical sources as saying troops fired at the crowd. But an eyewitness, speaking to the BBC, said the bulk of casualties was caused by the trucks running people over as chaos ensued, not by gunfire. In the aftermath, UN aid chief Martin Griffiths has said he's "appalled" by what's happened while President Joe Biden has said the US is "checking out" what happened. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
