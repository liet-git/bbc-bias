Israeli police say they are dealing with a rocket which fell on the city of Kiryat Shmona, near the border with Lebanon. No casualties or damage to property has been reported, but the attack comes after days of escalating tensions between Israel and the powerful Lebanese militia Hezbollah - who are key allies of Hamas. Cross-border strikes have been occurring for months, but tensions heightened following the killing of senior Hamas official Saleh al-Arouri in the Lebanese capital Beirut last week. Overnight, the IDF says it hit "numerous Hezbollah targets", including rocket launch positions and a Hezbollah military compound in Lebanon. Hezbollah has also claimed successful attacks on Israeli military positions, including barracks and a radar site in northern Israel. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
