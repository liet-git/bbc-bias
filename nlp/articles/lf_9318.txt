After weeks of fighting focused on northern Gaza – particularly around Gaza City – much of Israel’s military campaign is now concentrated on the enclave’s south, and its largest city of Khan Younis. Israeli believes some senior Hamas leaders could now be hiding in the city, which is the hometown of the overall commander of the group's military wing, Mohammed Deif, and the group's leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar. People in Khan Younis - hundreds of thousands of whom were forced to flee northern Gaza earlier in the war - are being ordered by Israel to evacuate and head towards Rafah, on the border with Egypt, and the nearby al-Mawasi area on the coast. But Israel’s campaign also continues in the north, including around the Jabalia refugee camp - Gaza’s largest before the war - which Israel claims was being used by Hamas as a base. It’s unclear how many civilians remain at Jabalia, but it has been the target of Israeli air strikes in recent weeks. Another area of focus for Israel is around Shejaiya, regarded as another Hamas stronghold, close to Gaza City. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
