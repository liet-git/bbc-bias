Sharone Lifschitz is the British-Israeli daughter of Yocheved, 85 - one of the first hostages released from Hamas captivity in Gaza in late October. Her father, Oded, 83 is still missing and believed to be held hostage in the Strip. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's PM programme, Sharone said mistakes happen in war but Israel has to use diplomatic efforts to free those still in captivity. "I know that people are petrified and people are scared," she said, adding that when her mother was still a captive, what frightened her most were attempts by the Israeli military to free them. "I know that all these attempts are incredibly dangerous," Sharone said, but Israel must "work towards the exchange of all hostages". "Israel has a moral duty towards the citizens it abandoned on 7 October. As the time passes that moral duty is becoming more and more urgent. " Sharone Lifschitz's (L) mother Yocheved, 85, was released by Hamas on 23 October. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
