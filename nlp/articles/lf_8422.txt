Ahead of the Security Council meeting on Wednesday, UN aid workers in Geneva could not hide their despair at the failure of the international community to put an end to the conflict. Unicef spokesman James Elder, who recently returned Gaza, told reporters that " every single child is enduring these 10 weeks of hell and not one of them can escape" . He lamented that "not even lip service" had been paid to requirements to safeguard medical facilities, food and water. Only eight of Gaza's 36 hospitals are even partially functioning, says the World Health Organization. They're overwhelmed by casualties, running out of medical supplies and fuel, while also providing shelter for thousands of displaced people.
