As we've been reporting today, thousands of Palestinians were ordered by Israeli forces to leave Nasser Medical Complex in Khan Younis . Nasser is the largest hospital in southern Gaza. Médecins Sans Frontières reported that displaced people were ordered to leave, with medical staff and patients being told they could remain in the hospital with a limit of one caretaker per patient. Intense fighting was also reported around Al-Amal hospital, which is close to Nasser. Mass displacement is not unusual - in November, the Israeli Defense Forces occupied al-Shifa Hospital, after claiming Hamas was using it as a base. It also raided Ibn Sina , a hospital in the occupied West Bank and several more in the refugee camp of Jenin. A doctor at Nasser hospital's emergency department, Haitham Ahmed, told BBC Arabic that Nasser's infrastructure has been damaged and that "sewage has unfortunately begun to flow into the departments". He added that medical supplies had also been destroyed in the attacks. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
