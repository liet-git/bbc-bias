Yemen's Houthis say they have made six attacks on ships in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden in the past three days. According to a statement published on the Houthi-controlled Saba news agency, the ships targeted include Maersk Saratoga, APL Detroit and Huang Pu - which are all said to be either US or UK affiliated. Another ship, Pretty Lady, was said to be headed for the Palestinian territories. Maersk has denied that its vessel had been attacked, the Reuters news agency reports. US Central Command reported an attack on Huang Pu on Saturday but said the vessel, which is Chinese owned and operated, suffered minimal damage. Houthi spokesman Yahya al-Sarea also said that Houthi forces targeted two US Destroyers and carried out missile attacks on a number of targets near the southern Israeli port city of Eilat. These claims could not be immediately verified. Sarea added that all "military operations achieved their objectives successfully". The Houthis have been targeting merchant vessels for months in response to Israel's assault on Gaza. British and American ships have also come under attack since the two countries began retaliating with airstrikes in Houthi-held areas of Yemen.
