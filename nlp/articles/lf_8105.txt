 F-N-S-T-A-R-T. 8105 F-N-E-N-D.  D-A-T-E-S-T-A-R-T. 2024-02-22 D-A-T-E-E-N-D.  T-I-T-L-E-S-T-A-R-T. Who is Sir Lindsay Hoyle? And what does the Speaker do? T-I-T-L-E-E-N-D.  T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. There’s a lot of talk about Sir Lindsay Hoyle this morning. But who is he? Well, he’s best known as the Speaker of the House of Commons – an office held always by an MP elected to the role by other MPs. The job requires him to be an impartial chair of debates in the Commons, ensure order and call MPs to speak. Hoyle, the MP for Chorley in Lancashire, was elected as Speaker on 4 November 2019, following the resignation of Speaker John Bercow. Yesterday, he sparked fury among SNP and Tory MPs for breaking with convention and choosing a Labour amendment for debate. Normally on what is known as an opposition day, the nominated opposition party - in this case the SNP - proposes a motion and only a government amendment is also considered. The anger culminated in a motion, proposed by Tory MP William Wragg, of no confidence in Hoyle’s Speakership. So far, 33 have signed it. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
