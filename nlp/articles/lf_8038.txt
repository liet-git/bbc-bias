Another key issue is displacement. Almost two million people - most of Gaza's population - are reported to have fled their homes from the fighting. The UN says more than half of Gaza's population is now crammed into Rafah - previously a town of 250,000 people. "Their living conditions are abysmal - they lack the basic necessities to survive, stalked by hunger, disease and death," according to the UN's relief co-ordinator Martin Griffiths. Overcrowding has become a major concern in UN emergency shelters in central and southern Gaza, with some far exceeding their capacity. Other families are living in tents or makeshift shelters in compounds or on open areas of waste ground. You can read more about the issues face by Palestinians in Gaza here. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
