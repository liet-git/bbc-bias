On Wednesday the UK air-dropped aid into Gaza for the first time since war broke out under a deal with Jordan. Four tonnes of supplies including medicines, food and fuel were delivered into the strip on a Jordanian Air Force plane on Wednesday. Packages fitted with parachutes floated down to the Tal al-Hawa Hospital in northern Gaza - where the UN has been warning of looming famine. UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron said the aid would save lives and keep the hospital running. The UK has until now only sent aid to Gaza by land and sea, but northern Gaza - a wasteland after nearly five months of war - is impossible to reach. On Tuesday the World Food Programme said it would stop sending food trucks to northern Gaza after they came under fire. Read Quentin Sommerville's full report on UK aid supplies reaching Gaza here.
