T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. The significance of Israel taking operational control, as they describe it, of the Gazan side of the Rafah crossing means they have got their soldiers there, it means that they have got their armoured vehicles there. And it means that they are in control of that area which is the southern route into Gaza. More broadly, one thing that Israel may be wanting to do is to take control of the entire area, which runs between Gaza and Egypt at the very southern point. It’s called the Philadelphi Corridor, and Israel says that if it takes control of that it would stop, in the future, tunnels being built in which might give people the chance to smuggle weapons in. But that’s looking quite a way ahead, because of course at the moment there is all this massive amount of diplomatic activity around the ceasefire talks. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
