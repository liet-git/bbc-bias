Israel's decision to pull a major division out of the southern city of Khan Younis and the Gaza Strip has led to questions about what this means for the war's timeframe. Is this a sign it's ending soon? Or is something bigger happening? The US has had its say, with White House National Security spokesman John Kirby telling ABC News that the IDF's troop reduction in southern Gaza appears to be a "rest and refit" - and not necessarily indicative of any new operations. "They've been on the ground for four months, the word we're getting is they're tired, they need to be refit," he told the broadcaster Sunday night, clarifying that it was "hard to know exactly what this tells us right now". Israel has been under pressure from the US over the way the war on Hamas is being waged. Last week, after an Israeli strike killed seven aid workers in Gaza, President Joe Biden told Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu that the US's ongoing support for Israel was dependent on "specific, concrete steps" to boost aid and prevent civilian deaths in the Palestinian enclave. Here's a snippet of a briefing Kirby gave following that call between Biden and Netanyahu: US says Israel must make changes in Gaza in 'hours and days' T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
