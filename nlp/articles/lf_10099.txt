As we've been reporting, Israel's military says it has intercepted the "vast majority" of missiles and drones launched by Iran. In a new statement, the IDF says it intercepted the majority using its "Arrow" aerial defence system, together with strategic allies in the region, before the launches crossed into Israeli territory. It says a small number of hits were recorded, including at an IDF base in southern Israel, "where minor damage was caused to infrastructure". Note that the Arrow defence system is designed to defeat ballistic missiles at high altitude, rather than slow moving drones. Israel used the Arrow system to shoot down a Houthi ballistic missile that was fired from Yemen at the outset of the war in Gaza. Drones or missiles vying for targets in northern Israel.
