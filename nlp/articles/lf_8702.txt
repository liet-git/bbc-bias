We’re now ending today's live coverage on the Israel-Gaza war. Thank you for staying with us today for the latest developments in the region and the ways Palestinians celebrated Eid despite the war. Here is a look at the most recent developments: The IDF has confirmed the killing of three sons of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in an air strike in the central Gaza Strip. The force named the three individuals as Amir, Mohammad and Hazem Haniyeh. The IDF said they were “Hamas military wing operatives”. It followed Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh saying three of his sons and several of his grandchildren were killed in an Israeli air strike. Haniyeh said in an interview with Al Jazeera that his sons' deaths would not affect the ceasefire negotiations with Israel. US President Joe Biden has criticised Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's handling of the war in Gaza, saying "I think what he's doing is a mistake. I don't agree with his approach" It comes as people across Gaza marked Eid al-Fitr , with Palestinians filmed praying on the ruins of a mosque destroyed in an air strike.
