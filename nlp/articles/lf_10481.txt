The Israelis say they have reason to believe that inside Nasser hospital will be evidence that some of the hostages taken into Gaza on 7 October were held there. Judging by the gunfire that's been heard around the Khan Younis hospital over the last few days, including the use of snipers, they also clearly believe that Hamas fighters have been using the hospital. If you think back to the tail end of last year and what happened at Shifa hospital in Gaza City, this is somewhat similar. The Israelis are not saying there's an entire infrastructure underneath the hospital, like they did last time - but they are clearly saying that Nasser hospital has been used and abused by Hamas. And that is why they seem so intent on getting inside the hospital, having laid siege to that area for a number of weeks. We've seen civilians who've been sheltering in the grounds of the hospital streaming out of the area. It’s possible some patients and medical staff have also had to leave, or move. This is a situation which is causing an enormous amount of anxiety and concern for those who remain inside. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
