As we reported a little earlier, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken will travel to the Middle East today for the fourth time since Hamas’s attacks on Israel in October. An unnamed US official told the AFP and Reuters news agencies that his visit will include a trip to Israel, amid concerns about the effect the conflict with Hamas is having on the wider region. The official said  Blinken leaves tonight "for stops in a number of capitals, including Israel" - but did not offer any further detail about Blinken’s itinerary. It comes after Hamas's deputy leader Saleh al-Arouri was assassinated in Beirut on Tuesday, prompting Lebanese group Hezbollah to say the killing will "not go unpunished". Israel has neither confirmed nor denied its involvement, but a spokesman called it a "surgical strike against the Hamas leadership". The top US diplomat's itinerary is being kept under wraps for now.
