I've just arrived at the White House, which is scheduled to hold a press briefing at 13:30 (17:30 GMT). Yesterday's briefing focused heavily on reports that Hamas accepted the outline of a ceasefire deal, as well as on the Israeli operation in Rafah. Today's is sure to again primarily focus on the last 24 hours in Gaza. At the moment, US President Joe Biden is at the Capitol, where he just delivered an address at the US Holocaust Memorial Museum's Annual Days of Remembrance ceremony. At the outset of his remarks, Biden noted rising antisemitism linked to the Israel-Hamas war, including on US college campuses. "[There are] too many people denying, downplaying, rationalising and ignoring the horrors of the Holocaust [and] October 7, including Hamas's appalling use of sexual violence, torture, to terrorise. " "It must stop," he added. Stay with us for more updates. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
