Cyprus's President Nikos Christodoulides says global leaders must "double down" on efforts to get aid into Gaza following the death of seven food aid workers in the enclave. The World Central Kitchen team had just unloaded food aid brought to Gaza via the maritime route from Cyprus when their convoy came under attack. "The Amalthea initiative will continue as long as the humanitarian needs are there," he says, referring to the maritime route which brings aid to Gaza via Cyprus. His comments follow a meeting with European Parliament President Roberta Metsola today, urging a swift investigation into the deaths of the seven World Central Kitchen aid workers. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
