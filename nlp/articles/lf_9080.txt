We're getting some more reaction from Israel and Hamas now in the wake of today's ICJ ruling. A Hamas spokesman tells the BBC: "We welcome the decision of the International Court of Justice, which demands that the brutal Zionist entity stop its aggression against our people in the city of Rafah. " Meanwhile Israel's opposition leader Yair Lapid says: "The fact that the ICJ did not even directly connect the end of the military operation in Rafah to the release of the hostages and to Israel's right to defend itself against terror is an abject moral failure. " He says that Israel "was brutally attacked from Gaza" and forced to defend itself against Hamas, adding: "There is no country in the world which wouldn't defend itself against an attack like that.
