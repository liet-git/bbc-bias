Palestinians in Rafah have been speaking to BBC Arabic's Gaza Lifeline programme about the difference between this year's Eid al-Fitr and previous Eid celebrations. Haroun Al-Medallal says that â€œdespite the pain, destruction, displacement, and continuous shelling by the Israeli army, we are a life-loving people". Speaking from a shelter in Rafah, he says some Palestinian women are making cookies as they try to put a smile on the faces of orphaned children who have lost their parents and homes. Alaa al-Eddah similarly tells the BBC that "sadness overcomes everyone" because of the record number of people who have been killed. Previously, he says, they visited "relatives and neighbours to congratulate each other on Eid, and the children used to rejoice," but now they "live in displacement". However, he insists they will remain steadfast, celebrate Eid, call relatives, and visit the people whose loved ones have been killed. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
