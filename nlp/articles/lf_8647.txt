While Israel has not taken responsibility for the operation that killed the deputy head of Hamas, Saleh al-Arouri, he is widely seen as having been near the top of an Israeli hit list. By many in the Israeli media, his killing is celebrated.  It is described as “a game changing event” and “the end of an era for Hamas” by Seth Frantzman in the Jerusalem Post. However, the possible negative repercussions are also picked over.  Israeli defence analysts note that the head of the powerful Lebanese armed group, Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, has previously said he would consider an assassination of any target in Beirut as crossing a red line. The question now, is whether he will stick to that. “Since the war began, Hezbollah has paid its dues to the Palestinians through daily attacks on Israel. But it has been careful to limit them to a strip of land near the border,” notes Amos Harel in Haaretz. “An escalation in the level of its response from Lebanon would reduce its room to manoeuvre and increase the chances of a mutual miscalculation. ”. Al-Arouri is seen as having been key to indirect talks mediated by Qatar and Egypt on Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. “Of all the possible acts of Hamas retaliation, the most worrisome concerns the hostages,” comments Nahum Barnea in Yedioth Ahronoth. “The assassination is far more likely to delay and possibly to derail further negotiations. ”.
