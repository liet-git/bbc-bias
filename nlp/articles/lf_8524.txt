With smoke rising over built-up parts of Rafah following the latest Israeli air strikes, the Israeli military has issued new evacuation orders – suggesting it’s expanding its offensive in Gaza’s southernmost city. Already Israeli tanks have encircled an area in the east, which it previously told residents to move from. The army has said its operations in Rafah – which it sees as a Hamas stronghold – are limited; falling short of the full invasion that the US and other world powers have warned against. However, they’ve already caused a new crisis in humanitarian operations – with severe shortages of food, clean water and fuel. The latest Israeli military orders also tell Palestinians to move away from parts of the northern Gaza Strip which Israeli forces had left months ago. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
