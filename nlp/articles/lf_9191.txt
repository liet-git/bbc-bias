A reported Israeli counterattack to Iran's unprecedented salvos sparks the next urgent question: what will Iran do next? Iran’s President Ebrahim Raisi had vowed that the “tiniest invasion” by Israel would bring a “massive and harsh” response. This is uncharted territory in a tortuous history of shadow wars and covert attacks between two states with abiding official enmity. Iran's military chiefs have spoken of a “new equation” ever since the 1 April airstrikes on its diplomatic compound in Damascus killed seven Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps officials,  including its most senior commander in the region. Those strikes are widely believed to have been carried out by Israel. Tehran says its old doctrine of “strategic patience,” of playing a longer game when its assets and individuals are attacked, has ended. Now it’s “strategic deterrence” – a readiness to hit back hard immediately. In these first fateful hours, Iranian officials are speaking of no direct attack, no damage. Their next move may depend on how they cast this latest shot in this spiralling tit for tat. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
