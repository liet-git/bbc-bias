T-I-T-L-E-E-N-D.  T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Israel's foreign minister has made a visit to Cyprus to promote the opening of a "maritime corridor" for humanitarian aid between the island and Gaza. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Eli Cohen says he met Cypriot Foreign Minister Constantinos Kombos to discuss the plan as part of Israel's "economic disengagement" from Gaza. In his own social media post, Kombos says the pair visited the Cypriot port of Larnaca and a coordination centre set up to deliver humanitarian assistance to Gaza. "Cyprus stands ready to provide this maritime lifeline," he adds. It is not entirely clear at what stage this plan is from the statements, but Cohen says the corridor will be under "Israeli-coordinated security inspection" and will "sever the economic dependence" of Gaza on Israel. Israel and Egypt have restricted the movement of goods and people in and out of Gaza since Hamas took control of the territory in 2007. Israel also controls the air space over Gaza and its shoreline, as well as the shared land border. The two countries say their blockade is needed for security reasons.
