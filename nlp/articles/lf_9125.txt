It's a Shia Muslim organisation which is politically influential and in control of the most powerful armed force in Lebanon. It's also designated a terrorist organisation by Western states, Israel, Gulf Arab countries and the Arab League. Hezbollah was established in the early 1980s by the region's most dominant Shia power, Iran, to oppose Israel. At the time, Israel's forces had occupied southern Lebanon, during the country's civil war. When Israel withdrew from Lebanon in 2000, Hezbollah took credit for pushing them out. Since then, it has maintained thousands of fighters and a huge missile arsenal in southern Lebanon. In 2006, a full-blown war broke out between Hezbollah and Israel, triggered when Hezbollah carried out a deadly cross-border raid. Israeli troops invaded southern Lebanon to try to eliminate the threat from Hezbollah. However, it survived and has since increased its number of fighters and obtained new and better weapons. It is funded and equipped by Iran. You can read more about the group here. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
