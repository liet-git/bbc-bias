Ismail Haniyeh is the head of the political apparatus of Hamas outside Gaza and the Palestinian territories. Israel makes no distinction between the different branches of Hamas – military and political – and says they are all terrorists. After he was told that his three sons and their children were targeted and killed, Haniyeh said that the lives of his children are no more valuable than those of any other Gazans. And that it wouldn’t affect Hamas’ position in the ceasefire talks in which he is a leading negotiator. The Americans want Hamas to soften their position, so perhaps killing Haniyeh’s children may not be the best way of achieving that. There are critics of Prime Minister Netanyahu in Israel who claim that he wants to prolong the war and he doesn’t want to do a ceasefire deal. And at the same time, Netanyahu is under immense amounts of pressure from the US to reach a compromise and allow an exchange of Palestinian prisoners in return for the hostages in Gaza. It’s now emerged that the Israel Defense Forces deliberated targeted the Haniyeh family, claiming that they were “on the way to carry out an act of terrorism. ”. So it might be seen by his critics as further proof that Netanyahu and the Israeli government are not committed to a deal. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
