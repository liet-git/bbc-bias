Hamas is a Palestinian group which has run Gaza since 2007 - it wants to destroy Israel and replace it with an Islamic state. The group has fought several wars with Israel since it took power, firing thousands of rockets into Israel and carrying out other deadly attacks. In response, Israel has repeatedly attacked Hamas with air strikes, sending in troops in 2008 and 2014, and now this year again. Hamas - which has been designated by some powers as a terrorist group - is backed by Iran, which provides funding, weapons and training.
