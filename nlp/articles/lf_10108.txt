This is uncharted territory fraught with risk and unpredictability. Iran and Israel have fought shadow wars for decades, but for the first time Iran is now targeting Israel directly from Iranian soil. This is no longer a confrontation led by Iran’s array of powerful proxies across the region against an enemy which has long kept silent about its own attacks on Iranian assets and targeted assassinations. Israel describes Iran as the world’s greatest sponsor of terrorism; for Iran, hostility towards Israel, what it calls the “Zionist regime” is a core tenet of its 1979 revolutionary doctrine. The risk of confrontation had risen with every month the Gaza war has ground on. Iran has long prided itself on playing a long game, on exercising “strategic patience". Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has avoided all-out war ever since he came to power in 1989 in the shadow of the destructive Iran-Iraq war. Now the world waits to see the impact of this unprecedented strike. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
