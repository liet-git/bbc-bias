A 17th arrest has been made after a pro-Palestinian group occupied a University of Oxford building. Oxford Action for Palestine (OA4P) started a sit-in at university offices in Wellington Square on 23 May, demanding a meeting over its Israel-Gaza conflict policies. Sixteen people were previously arrested on suspicion of aggravated trespass. They have now also been further arrested on suspicion of affray. All have been released on bail. The 17th person was also arrested on suspicion of the same offences. Thames Valley Police said officers also dealt with protesters "in the immediate vicinity of Wellington Square", who "have been peaceful and no arrests were made". A spokesperson for OX4P said the students had staged "a peaceful sit-in to demand that the university meet with us after two weeks of non-response", demanding that administration meet with them "to negotiate immediately". The university said the temporary occupation of the building had caused "significant distress" to staff. "It is clear that the actions of some of the protesters involved in the encampment have created a deeply intimidating environment for many members of our community, including our Jewish students and staff and members of the local Jewish community," it said in a statement.
