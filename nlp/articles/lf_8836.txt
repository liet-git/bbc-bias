Russia's UN Security Council representative has blamed the "hardheaded, selfish" position of the US for the current situation in Gaza. "The outcomes of this quiet diplomacy are a cemetary of Palestininan children," he says. He also says that American diplomacy leaves "scorched earth" in its wake and he warned fellow members they may end up on the "wrong side of history".
