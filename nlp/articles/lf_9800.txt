We'll soon be pausing our live coverage, but before we go, here's a look at some of the latest developments from the Middle East: A military base in Iraq housing a pro-Iranian militia has been damaged by an explosion, according to security sources. The militia, the Popular Mobilisation Forces, blamed an attack. Israel continued its offensive in Gaza overnight. The Hamas-run health ministry said at least nine people were killed in strikes on an apartment block in Rafah. Israeli military said at least 10 militants have been killed during a raid in Nur Shams refugee camp in the West Bank. UNRWA, the UN relief agency for Palestinian refugees, told the BBC that the threat of disease outbreaks in Gaza is growing, as temperatures start to rise over summer. Earlier, Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian wanred that his country would give an immediate response if Israel launched a significant attack. Amirabdollahian still downplayed Friday's attack on Isfahan, questioning whether Israel was involved.
