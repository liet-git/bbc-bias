We brought you some lines earlier from a British physician working in Rafah, who described shelling in the southern Gaza city as being "non-stop" overnight. Dr James Smith tells the BBC that some hospitals in Rafah have begun "pre-emptive evacuations", which he says "signifies how petrified people are of what the Israelis have the capacity to do, including to patients and healthcare workers". Smith says Gaza's main roads on Wednesday were "incredibly crowded" with people moving their belongings, including cooking pots and mattresses strapped to the roof. Fighting is continuing in the city, as the Israeli military says it's conducting a "precise" counterterrorism operation. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
