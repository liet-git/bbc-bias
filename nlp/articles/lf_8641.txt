In Moucharafiyeh, in the southern suburb of Beirut where the attack took place, itâ€™s business as usual. The streets are crowded, the shops are open and press crews are present in very large numbers. The main street where the killing happened is closed to the public. Lebanese Army tanks are parked alongside the road, while a large poster of Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, adorns an unfinished high-rise nearby. In the office that was targeted, forensic investigators in white suits survey the area and workers continue to clear the rubble while onlookers comment on the nature of the attack and how precise it was, leaving other apartments in the building almost intact. But what people worry about the most are the military and political shockwaves of what is seen in Lebanon as a massive escalation by Israel. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
