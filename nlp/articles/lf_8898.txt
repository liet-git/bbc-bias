The head of the World Health Organisation has also issued dire warnings about the risk of insufficient food in Gaza, warning "famine is looming" in the Strip. In a post on social media, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus says people there are "facing starvation and selling their possessions in exchange for food", adding that parents are going hungry to feed their children. He says the situation is "catastrophic to the health of people across the Strip", explaining that four in five households remaining in northern Gaza - as well as half of the displaced households in the south - are going "entire days and nights without eating". This protracted conflict is blocking much-needed access to food and other life-saving humanitarian aid. Displaced people are crowding in shelters amid harsh winter conditions, which will inevitably increase the spread of disease. " The WHO is not the only global body issuing dire warnings about the growing risk of famine, the UN's World Food Programme has warned nearly all of Gaza's 2.2 million people are dealing with acute food shortages.
