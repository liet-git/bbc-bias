It's just past 07:00 in Los Angeles and if you're just joining us, here's what's been happening: Police have now largely cleared the Gaza protest encampment at UCLA . In the early hours of the morning, dozens of officers entered the protest site and started detaining people. Some students have been pictured sitting on the ground next to police buses with their hands zip-tied behind their backs. Officers surrounded the site before dawn , removed the makeshift barricades and started dismantling tents. A number of loud bangs were heard as clashes erupted between law enforcement officers and protestors. P rotesters linked arms to try to prevent officers from moving forward, but police pushed through. A number of other campuses across the US are also seeing clashes between pro-Palestinian protestors and police, and dozens of students and faculty members arrested. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
