Well that was quite a show. Somewhere in the chaos of this evening the Commons voted unanimously for the Labour amendment calling for a Gaza ceasefire - although technically due to a walkout by other parties they were the only ones really voting. The scenes were not appreciated by some of those charities dealing directly with the effects of the war in Gaza. Halima Begum, the chief executive of ActionAid UK, said her charity was "extremely disappointed to see the utter paralysis in Parliament this evening". "A great disservice has been done to the British people," she said "It’s time to put people’s lives above politics. " Care International's boss Helen McEachern meanwhile condemned the "theatrics" of MPs, adding that "arguments over parliamentary procedure do nothing to assist the people of Gaza". T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
