We're pausing our live coverage shortly, here are the latest developments in the Israel-Gaza war: Three Israeli hostages mistakenly killed by Israeli troops in Gaza on Friday were shot after they were mis-identified as "terrorists", the IDF has said. The hostages emerged from a building with a white cloth on a stick, and an Israeli soldier felt threatened and opened fire, an IDF official said. Israeli families of hostages held in Gaza have demanded an immediate return to negotiations with Hamas, during a rally in Tel Aviv. The Israeli PM's senior adviser, Mark Regev, said he wouldn't go into detail on reports of hostage negotiations resuming with Hamas. Meanwhile, reports say dozens of people have been killed in Israeli air strikes in Jabalia in northern Gaza, with many civilians said to be trapped under rubble. Attacks by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen have prompted four of the world's largest shipping companies to suspend travel through the Red Sea. The IDF said it struck a number of military buildings and "terrorist infrastructures" belonging to Hezbollah - the powerful Iranian-backed militia in Lebanon - after attacks launched from Lebanon towards Israel. Large crowds are at a rally in Tel Aviv demanding the Israeli government do more to free hostages in Gaza. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
