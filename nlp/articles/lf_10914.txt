In Tel Aviv this morning, Israelis gathered to mark six months since the Hamas attacks on 7 October which triggered the war in Gaza. About 129 hostages remain unaccounted for after being kidnapped. At least 34 of them are presumed dead. Twelve bodies have been recovered by the IDF. Last night, tens of thousands of Israelis rallied against their Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, demanding a Gaza hostage deal. Hostage relatives formed an installation in Tel Aviv called "Time Kills", demanding Netanyahu's government does everything it can to bring the hostages home. The protestors formed the shape of an hourglass to signify time running out, as part of the demonstration. Among the protesters was Ziv Abud, the girlfriend of hostage Eliya Cohen, who was kidnapped by Hamas on 7 October. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
