There’s been increased cross-border fighting between Israel and the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah since the Hamas attacks on 7 October. But rocket fire and the use of weaponised drones by Hezbollah has escalated further this week, and Israel has responded. An Israeli war cabinet minister, Benny Gantz, warned that if the world and the Lebanese government didn’t act to stop the attacks, then the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) would take matters into its own hands. In Gaza, as IDF troops have pushed into the central urban refugee camps and continue to target Hamas in Khan Younis in the south, tens of thousands of people have been fleeing. With a lack of shelters in crowded Deir al-Balah and Rafah, many new arrivals there are sleeping rough or in tents on the streets. Israeli troops near the border with Lebanon. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
