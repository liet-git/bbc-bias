T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. American officials have been warning Israel not to start a major ground operation of Rafah for weeks. They have said that the potential for massive civilian casualties is high and that the move will further alienate Israel on the world stage. The US has made an intense diplomatic effort to broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas that would forestall action in Rafah. Recent news that the Americans delayed a munitions delivery to the Israelis could be meant as a preview of consequences if Israel chooses to move forward with a military assault. As a Rafah evacuation begins, the US efforts appear increasingly fruitless. An invasion would deal yet another blow to the Biden administration’s “bear hug” strategy: American support for Israel in public that allows them, in private, to guide the Israelis toward less drastic military action. An escalation of violence in Gaza would also complicate domestic politics for Joe Biden, who is already dealing with critics on the left and right claiming his policy of support for Israel either goes too far or not far enough. Administration officials had hoped that a ceasefire would buy the president some breathing room amid widespread US university protests and public concerns about civil unrest. Instead, the future may hold another wave of bloodshed and destruction in Gaza. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
