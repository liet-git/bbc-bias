A leading academic from a foreign affairs think-tank tells the BBC she believes Iran and Hezbollah do not want to get "embroiled" in a direct conflict with Israel or the West. Barbara Slavin, a distinguished fellow at the Stimson Center in Washington, says Iran is making vague threats of "severe retaliation" over the Gaza-Israel conflict but nothing specific. Slavin puts this down to Iran "piggybacking off the struggle of the Palestinians" and wanting to benefit from the fallout of the 7 October attacks by Hamas on Israel. Referring to the bomb blasts which killed 84 people in Iran on Wednesday, Slavin says whilst the culprits are still unknown, she suspects Iran will continue to blame Israel or the US in "some form or fashion". The US has already said it had no indication that Israel was involved and dismissed any suggestion that Washington was involved. Slavin says Iran has embraced the Palestinan cause to exploit tensions but adds: "On the other hand the Israelis cannot expect that Iran will be able to solve the Palestinian issue for them. . . even if Iran were to stop its support for Hamas, I'm sure Palestinians would continue to resist and protest occupation by Israel.
