T-I-T-L-E-E-N-D.  T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Hamas's government media office says at least 210 people were killed and at least 400 wounded on Saturday in Israeli strikes in and around the al-Nuseirat refugee camp. So far, the Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are generally considered to be more reliable than the Hamas government media office, has not given a number of casualties. Earlier, Israel Defense Forces spokesman Daniel Hagari said Cogat, the Israeli defence ministry body in charge of civilian policy in the occupied West Bank and Gaza, estimated there had been under 100 casualties.
