T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Omar is a four-year-old boy currently being treated in a hospital in central Gaza. Thirty-five members of his family were killed in an Israeli air strike on his home, a family member told the BBC, in an attack that saw him lose an arm. BBC Arabic spoke to a relative who is looking after him, who said Omar asks about the whereabouts of his mum and grandmother. “When he comes and asks about his family, I can’t answer. Instead, I take a deep breath and try to run from the question in a kids’ manner by changing the subject. He needs a specific way to be told the information so that he doesn’t go into shock,” the man says. “ He has an amputation in his left hand, scars on his chest and face, his lower jaw is dislocated, he has a huge opening beneath his knee in his right leg from the missiles. We have never seen missiles like that before. The missile fell and destroyed the whole residential area around it”. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
