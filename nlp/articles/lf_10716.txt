The UN General Assembly is set to vote today on an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, days after the US vetoed a similar resolution proposed in the Security Council. The current proposed draft was put forward by a group of 20 Arab countries and the Organisation for Islamic Cooperation. No country has a veto power in the 193-member General Assembly. However, unlike in the Security Council, General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding, though they do reflect global opinion. Since the war began, the Security Council has failed six times to adopt a resolution demanding a ceasefire because of disagreement among its 15 members. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
