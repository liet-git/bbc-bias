During Joe Biden's phone call with Benjamin Netanyahu, the pair discussed the Kerem Shalom aid crossing. Situated on the corner between Israel's border with Gaza and Egypt, the crossing is one of the main routes used to deliver humanitarian aid into Gaza. It has been closed all day, with Cogat - the Israeli body that coordinates government activities in the occupied territories - saying it was due to "security reasons", after Hamas rocket strikes nearby killed four Israeli soldiers yesterday. In the official US readout of the meeting, it says Netanyahu has agreed to "ensure" the crossing is open "for humanitarian assistance for those in need". T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
