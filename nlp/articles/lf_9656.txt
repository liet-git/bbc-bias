Stepping away from the Security Council's resolution momentarily, the UN's humanitarian chief has announced he's stepping down after three years in the role. Martin Griffiths, head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), has been pushing for more aid to reach Gaza since the early stages of the war. In the last few weeks, he issued an unusually strong-worded statement, warning that an Israeli assault on Rafah, Gaza's southernmost city, could lead to a "slaughter". An Israeli invasion of the city, he said, would "leave an already fragile humanitarian operation at death's door". In a post on X, Griffiths said the job role had been "the privilege of my life". He did not give a reason for why he was leaving. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
