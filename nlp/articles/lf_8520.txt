Earlier in the week, Israel's army said it was directing about 100,000 people out of eastern Rafah in southern Gaza towards an “expanded humanitarian area”. This zone, which is north of Rafah, stretches from al-Mawasi to the city of Khan Younis and the central town of Deir al-Balah. The UN has said the evacuation zone covers more than 30 sq km (12 sq miles) and had nine shelters for displaced people, three clinics, and six warehouses. A few days ago the UN agency Unwra warned the area couldn’t accommodate any more people and said about 80,000 people had already fled Rafah since Monday. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
