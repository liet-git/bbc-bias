There are four big political stories in the mix this morning - on Gaza, the Post Office, immigration and Trident. MP's will this afternoon debate an SNP call for an immediate ceasefire i n Gaza, which is likely to test Labour's stance on the issue. Second is the continuing Post Office scandal fallout , with an ongoing row between Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch and the ex-Post Office boss, Henry Staunton, who she sacked. Staunton claims he was told to delay Horizon compensation payments for sub-postmasters, but Badenoch has denied this and PM Rishi Sunak has backed her . Third is the dramatic sacking of the independent immigration watchdog , David Neal, last night, following leaked news stories from 15 of his reports that remain unpublished. Fourth is concern over the embarrassing failure of the UK's nuclear deterrent , Trident, in Royal Navy tests for the second time in a row, with Defence Secretary Grant Shapps expected to give reassurances at the dispatch box this afternoon. Rishi Sunak will be answering Prime Minister's Questions today. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
