 F-N-S-T-A-R-T. 10774 F-N-E-N-D.  D-A-T-E-S-T-A-R-T. 2024-01-26 D-A-T-E-E-N-D.  T-I-T-L-E-S-T-A-R-T. ICJ could order Israel to stop Gaza campaign. T-I-T-L-E-E-N-D.  T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. The ICJ is not about to rule on whether Israel is guilty of genocide in Gaza. That ruling is probably some years away, but in the meantime, the court is expected to decide whether South Africa’s accusation of genocide against Israel is plausible, and if so, whether what are known as "provisional measures" are appropriate. South Africa has asked for nine separate measures, including the immediate suspension of Israel’s military operations and a significant easing of the humanitarian situation in Gaza, in order to avoid any possibility of genocide. The ICJ's rulings are not enforceable and Israel could – and almost certainly would – choose to ignore its call for a ceasefire. The court could grant all or some South Africa’s provisional requests, or possibly order new ones. Israel has argued that South Africa’s case has no merit and should be rejected in its entirety. The case could be thrown out on a technicality: Israel argued that the two countries were not “in dispute” (required by the ICJ rules), saying that South Africa had barely communicated with Israel before applying to the court. But if the court finds that South Africa’s case is at least plausible, this could have severe diplomatic and commercial consequences for Israel. It’ll be interesting to see how the ICJ's 15 permanent judges differ. The west and global south are both well-represented on the bench (Israel and South Africa have both appointed ad-hoc judges for this case, as the rules permit). Will their views reflect the world’s strongly divergent opinions on the war in Gaza? T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
