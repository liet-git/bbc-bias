T-I-T-L-E-E-N-D.  T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Israel's military says it has arrested more than 70 Hamas members at a hospital in northern Gaza, as health officials in the territory accused Israeli forces of preventing medical staff from providing care. A spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces, Avichay Adraee, said the fighters had "surrendered with their weapons" at Kamal Adwan hospital. Writing on X, he also posted a series of images showing men stripped to the waist giving up what appear to be guns. A spokesperson for the Hamas-run health ministry accused Israeli forces of preventing medical staff from providing care to 10 injured people at the hospital, reportedly causing two of them to die. Adraee did not comment on those specific allegations. It comes after the UN reported that the hospital had been "surrounded by Israeli troops and tanks for days, with armed clashes reported nearby". Since the war began on 7 October, Israel has accused Hamas of using hospitals for military purposes. Hundreds of thousands of people have fled northern Gaza, which was the earlier focus of the war. Damage to one of the units at the Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza was photographed back in November. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
