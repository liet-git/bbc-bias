T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Flares lit up the skies over Rafah overnight and witnesses said there was continuous Israeli bombardment. Earlier celebrations by Gazans after Hamas leaders dramatically declared they had approved a deal for a ceasefire and the release of Israeli hostages had proven premature. The Hamas announcement came just hours after Israel had ordered an evacuation of eastern Rafah signalling that an invasion was imminent. Israel was quick to question what Hamas had agreed to, with one unnamed official suggesting the proposal appeared to be a watered-down version of an Egyptian offer which included elements that Israel could not accept. Ultimately, Israel’s war cabinet decided to continue its operation in Rafah while sending negotiators to Egypt to work on a deal. Last night US President Joe Biden called Israel’s prime minister and reiterated US concerns about a full offensive in Rafah – which is crowded with displaced people. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
