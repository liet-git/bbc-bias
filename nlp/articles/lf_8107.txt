In extraordinary scenes yesterday, SNP MPs and some Tories walked out of the chamber over the Speaker's handling of the vote - and 33 MPs have now called for him to resign. This came just before MPs were due to vote on calls for a ceasefire. As we've been reporting, a Labour amendment calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire was ultimately nodded through. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer condemned the walkout, saying it was clear that "only Labour that will put country over party and silly political games in order to deliver. " Charities dealing directly with the effects of the war in Gaza also hit out at the "theatrics" in Parliament. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
