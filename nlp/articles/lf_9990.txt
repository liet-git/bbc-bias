T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. The story of Iran's unprecedented attack on Israel would have been different if the Israeli response had not been so successful. Israel says 99% of the 300 drones and cruise and ballistic missiles that had been fired were shot down by the country and its allies. On Sunday, as Israel returned to normal, that was a source of celebration - while everyone, here and elsewhere, waited for a possible Israeli reaction. “The power of Israel is that we have a shield, a defence from these threats,” 54-year-old Ariel tells me, in Jerusalem. “[The Iranian attack] was expected . . . Israel is probably going to respond. I hope there won’t be a [wider] war. ”. Iran’s attack was not a surprise, as for almost two weeks the country had publicised its intention to respond to an air strike on its diplomatic compound in the Syrian capital, Damascus, that killed several military advisers, including two top generals - an attack widely believed to have been carried out by Israel. “We knew that Iran was going to attack. . . we were a bit nervous. But we know we have a great shield,” 44-year-old Einat says. “We don’t want things to get worse [with a reaction]. ”. The US was one of the countries that helped in the Israeli defence, but Biden administration officials are saying there will not be American support to an Israeli response, and that Israel’s reaction to the attack was already a victory over Iran. “It was a terrifying [night], the children didn’t sleep all night, they came to our bed, slept with us,” 41-year-old Moran says. “We have the most powerful army in the world, and we believe it will be okay. I wish we would attack, but we can’t because of the US. ”. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
