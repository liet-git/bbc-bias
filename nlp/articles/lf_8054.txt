SNP MP David Linden has said he believes that Sir Lindsay Hoyle's position as Speaker is "untenable" and that he will be out of his position by the weekend. Speaking to our colleagues on Radio 4's PM programme, Linden says: “The reality is, the Speaker of the House of Commons was bounced into this by the Labour leadership. “Sir Keir Starmer said he did not pressure the Speaker but he has avoided the question as to whether other Labour MPs did. " Linden added that the Speaker should now "do the right thing and resign to allow us to get back to the issues that matter". As a reminder, the Speaker went against Parliamentary convention yesterday by allowing a vote on a Labour amendment to an SNP proposal. He has since apologised to the SNP. Starmer has denied threatening Hoyle, saying he “simply urged” the Speaker to ensure there was the “broadest possible debate”. David Linden spoke on the matter in the Commons earlier, saying he liked Hoyle on a 'personal level' T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
