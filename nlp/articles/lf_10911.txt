T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. One who is critical of Israel's approach to the war is Prof Yossi Mekelberg, an associate fellow with the Middle East and North Africa Programme at the London-based Chatham House think tank. Speaking to Radio 5 Live this morning, he says that after six months of war, things have gone "catastrophically wrong". "The hostages are still in captivity. They’re in social hell. More than 33,000 Gazan people have been killed, many of them civilians," he tells BBC Radio 5 Live. "Obviously, Israel suffered a terrible atrocity in the hands of Hamas but it went to war instead of [having] a strategy and political objective which is achievable. "More revenge and vengeance is not a way to conduct a war, hence where we are now. ”. He says what will determine a ceasefire is the international pressure put on both sides to reach an agreement. "In the case of Hamas, they would like to see a permanent truce because, when the hostages are released, Israel will be after them and also leaves itself the room to continue the war. From Netanyahu’s point of view, the call for a new election and if you look at the opinion polls, he’s most likely to lose this election. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
