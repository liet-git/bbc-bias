EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has been holding a press conference alongside UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini, following a meeting between the pair and EU development ministers in Belgium. He says they have agreed the EU needs to continue to fund the work of the UN's Palestinian refugee agency. It follows the controversy last month over Israeli allegations concerning 13 - now sacked - UNRWA staff accused of participating in the 7 October attacks. Both the US and UK pulled funding from the organisation in the aftermath. Borrell welcomed the UNRWA's swift action in sacking the staff and launching an investigation into the claims. He went on to say the agency's work was vital in supporting millions of Palestinians outside of Gaza, as well as supplying essential humanitarian aid in The Strip. To discontinue support to UNRWA would "mean a greater humanitarian disaster in Gaza and "it should be avoided", he says. He adds that without the support of the UNRWA, 5.6m Palestinian refugees would be even more vulnerable. We'll bring you more shortly. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
