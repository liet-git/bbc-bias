T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Palestinian media reports say dozens of people have been killed in Israeli air strikes in Jabalia  in northern Gaza, with many civilians said to be trapped under rubble there. Palestinian Wafa news agency said at least three dozen people had been killed in strikes on three houses in the Jabalia refugee camp. The Israeli military said its aircraft targeted a building in Jabalia after militants were identified on the roof and its forces came under fire. The reports are unconfirmed by Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry, which has previously said Israel's ground offensive and the targeting of medical facilities have made it difficult to gather information about casualties in the north of the Strip. Gaza residents have also reported intense fighting overnight in Shejaiya, Sheikh Radwan, Zeitoun, Tuffah and Beit Hanoun in the north, and in the centre, east and north of Khan Younis, Reuters news agency reports.
