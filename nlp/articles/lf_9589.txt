T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Most of the world already recognises Palestine as a state. Earlier this month, 143 of the 193 members of the United Nations General Assembly voted in favour of Palestine joining the UN, something only states can do. As of this morning, only nine European countries supported Palestinian statehood and most of those took the decision in 1988 when part of the Soviet bloc. So for Norway, Ireland and Spain to join their number is both rare and significant. These countries hope not only to signal symbolic support for Palestinians but also to inject some momentum into a political process they hope could help end the fighting. Many Arab countries say they would help police and reconstruct a post-war Gaza only if the West recognises the state of Palestine as part of that political process. But most other European countries still believe recognition should come only as part of a long term two-state solution to the conflict. So Norway, Ireland and Spain are playing a diplomatic card they hope will be picked up by others. But it will not change the reality on the ground. Palestinians inspect the site of an Israeli strike on a house in Beit Lahia, in the northern Gaza Strip, on Monday. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
