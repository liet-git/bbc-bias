At the daily White House briefing earlier today, John Kirby, the National Security Council Coordinator for Strategic Communications, told reporters that the US was ‘‘outraged to learn about the strike". Kirby took time to draw attention to the approximately 200 aid workers that have been killed since 7 October in Gaza and laid the responsibility for the safety of aid workers in the region with the Israeli military. He emphasised that the IDF must work at improving the "deconfliction" process, saying the US would make clear to Israel that humanitarian aid workers in Gaza must be protected. There was also confirmation that President Joe Biden had spoken with Chef Jose Andres, the head of World Central Kitchen, and shared his "deepest condolences" with the charity. He also said that the White House fully respected the decision from World Central Kitchen to pause its Gaza operation. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
