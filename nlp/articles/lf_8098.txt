 F-N-S-T-A-R-T. 8098 F-N-E-N-D.  D-A-T-E-S-T-A-R-T. 2024-02-22 D-A-T-E-E-N-D.  T-I-T-L-E-S-T-A-R-T. A Speaker in jeopardy. T-I-T-L-E-E-N-D.  T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. As of writing this, there are currently 53 MPs signed up to a motion of no confidence in the Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle. That's up from around 30 since just a few hours ago. As a reminder, the Speaker must remain politically impartial and needs to command the confidence of the House of Commons. So how much jeopardy is Hoyle in? The Leader of the House of Commons, Penny Mordaunt, will face questions from MPs in the House of Commons today and no doubt some of those who signed up to the motion of no confidence will ask for there to be a debate on the Speaker's future. As my colleague Peter Barnes pointed out earlier , there’s no formal mechanism for MPs to oust the Speaker. However, there is a precedent for a speaker being pressured into resignation. Maria Caulfield, the Conservative health minister, was certainly adding to that pressure this morning when she alleged that he had taken “no consideration of what would happen to Conservative MPs" by allowing Labour’s motion. The question is whether there will be enough pressure on Hoyle so that he feels he must quit. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
