The International Criminal Court (ICC) has just responded to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's rejection of its prosecutor's request for arrest warrants for Israeli - and Hamas - leaders. In a statement, the ICC says that despite "significant efforts" it has not received "any information that has demonstrated genuine action at the domestic level [in Israel] to address the crimes alleged or the individuals under investigation". "The prosecutor has also repeatedly underlined his concerns regarding the adherence of Israel to international humanitarian law and has emphasised publicly that he has not seen any discernible change in conduct despite his earlier statements," the statement adds.
