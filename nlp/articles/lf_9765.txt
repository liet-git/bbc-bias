A private US firm that is partnering with the US military to deliver aid to Gaza can begin aid shipments within weeks of getting funded, the BBC has learned. A source familiar with the planning told the BBC that the group - known as Fogbow - is planning to meet with prospective donors at an event hosted by the Cypriot government soon. The BBC as reached out to Cyprus' government for comment. The source said that, if funded, Fogbow will be able to begin deliveries within three weeks, directly to a beach in Gaza. In the first month, the group believes it could deliver 6,000 truck equivalent units of aid  - which would then be expanded once the US military pier is completed. Read more about the plan here.
