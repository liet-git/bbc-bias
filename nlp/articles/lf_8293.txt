Israel's National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir has insisted that the army should launch its military offensive in Gaza's southern city of Rafah now. Speaking on Israeli radio channel Non Stop Radio 103FM earlier today, Ben-Gvir, who leads the ultranationalist Otzma Yehudit or "Jewish Power" party and who is known for making controversial remarks, said the Israeli army should enter the city even without US support. “We must enter Rafah now,” he said. Israel is under mounting international pressure to halt its plans to launch a military offensive in the southern city, where hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians have fled to for shelter during the fighting elsewhere in the territory. The US, Israel's strongest ally, is among those who have repeatedly warned against launching such an offensive. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
