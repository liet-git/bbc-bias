"This feels like a second Nakba," Naim al-Khatib, a Palestinian from Gaza City, tells me. The Nakba , or 'Catastrophe' in Arabic, refers to the events following 14 May 1948, when Israel declared independence. In a war which began the next day, up to 750,000 Palestinians who had lived on that land fled or were expelled from their homes. Neither they nor their descendants have been allowed by Israel to return, and many still live in refugee camps in the West Bank, Gaza, and other neighbouring countries. Al-Khatib says his flight from Gaza City to Cairo feels like the stories his parents used to tell him about fleeing their homes in 1948. They left everything, he says, believing they would be back in "a matter of days or weeks". That is one reason some Gazans have been reluctant to leave their homes, despite repeated evacuation orders by Israel. Al-Khatib says he would have remained too if his family had left safely. "Everything we go through, our mindset keeps rejecting the idea of leaving our home for fear of not being able to get back," he says. He adds that many people are posting photos on social media of themselves leaving their homes last month alongside those of their ancestors leaving theirs in 1948. "But those photos are in colour, not in black and white," he says. Earlier this month, a senior UN official accused Israel of seeking to expel Palestinians from Gaza into Egypt. Israel rejects this allegation, saying "there is not, never was and never will be an Israeli plan to move the residents of Gaza to Egypt. " Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have fled their homes to escape the Israeli bombardment in Gaza, ordered by Israel to move further and further south. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
