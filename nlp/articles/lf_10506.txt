Nasser hospital has been both overwhelmed by huge numbers of casualties and thousands of sheltering Palestinians for weeks. Palestinians said Israeli forces ordered thousands of displaced people to evacuate the facility in the southern city of Khan Younis on Wednesday. Videos showed an announcement via loudspeaker and a crowd leaving the Nasser Medical Complex. Israel's military said it had opened a secure route for civilians, but did not intend to evacuate patients and medics. Doctors and health officials also say a number of people there have been killed by Israeli sniper fire in recent days. Khan Younis has been the focus of Israel's invasion of the south of Gaza, which began in early December after troops largely took control of Hamas strongholds in the north. More on this here.
