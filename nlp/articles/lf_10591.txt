 F-N-S-T-A-R-T. 10591 F-N-E-N-D.  D-A-T-E-S-T-A-R-T. 2024-04-16 D-A-T-E-E-N-D.  T-I-T-L-E-S-T-A-R-T. Do Iran and Israel have nuclear weapons? T-I-T-L-E-E-N-D.  T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Israel is assumed to have its own nuclear weapons but maintains an official policy of deliberate ambiguity. Iran does not have nuclear weapons and also denies it is attempting to use its civilian nuclear programme to become a nuclear armed state. Last year the global nuclear watchdog found uranium particles enriched to 83.7% purity - very close to weapons grade - at Iran's underground Fordo site. Iran said "unintended fluctuations" in enrichment levels may have occurred. Iran has been openly enriching uranium to 60% purity for more than two years in breach of a 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. However that deal has been close to collapse since US President Donald Trump pulled out unilaterally and reinstated crippling sanctions on Iran in 2018. Israel had opposed the nuclear deal in the first place. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
