Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez says explanations provided by Israel about the killing of seven people working for the aid charity World Central Kitchen in a Gaza airstrike were "insufficient" and "unacceptable". Earlier this week, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had called the incident "a tragic event in which our forces unintentionally harmed non-combatants", adding that "this happens in war". Sanchez, however, is demanding further details. He says he is "awaiting a much stronger and more detailed clarification, after which we'll see what action to take". World Central Kitchen was founded by Spanish American chef José Andrés. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
