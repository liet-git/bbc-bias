Israel is continuing its discussions of next steps and has not yet decided what course of action it will take, a spokesperson for the Israeli government tells the BBC's Newshour programme. Avi Hyman says Israel is currently monitoring the situation and holding a war cabinet meeting. "We, like any sovereign democracy, will decide the best course of action," he says. "That course of action hasn't been decided, but I'll remind you that it was us who were running to the bomb shelters on Saturday night, it was our children that we were hugging on to, as missiles were exploding over our heads," he adds. Israeli soldiers gather on Monday next to military vehicles near the Israel-Gaza border. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
