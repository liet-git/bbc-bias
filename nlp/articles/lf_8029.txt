Yesterday, EU leaders called for an "immediate humanitarian pause" in Gaza and  urged Israel not to launch a major ground offensive in Rafah. A statement released on behalf of all 27 leaders said: "The European Council calls for an immediate humanitarian pause leading to a sustainable ceasefire"  while it also called for "the unconditional release of all hostages". The Council added that it "urges the Israeli government not to undertake a ground operation in Rafah".
