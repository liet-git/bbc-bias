An Israeli delegation of mid-level ‘technical experts’ has arrived in Cairo in order to ‘study’ the amended version of a ceasefire plan that Hamas has accepted. This is further than the Israeli government was prepared to go last weekend when the Hamas negotiating team sat down in Cairo with Egyptian and Qatari mediators but Israel didn’t show up as it assessed Hamas’s position as being too far away from what it could accept. Israel still says Hamas’s terms ‘do not meet its needs’ but it is now engaging in the process. The team sent to Cairo – consisting of intelligence and security officials – reportedly have no mandate to negotiate. But if they believe a deal is within reach then we can expect to see a top-level delegation, probably headed by the Mossad chief, David Barnea, heading to Cairo to negotiate. Meanwhile Israel’s military offensive in eastern Rafah, at the south-eastern corner of the Gaza Strip, continues. This has brought international criticism from the UN, Egypt and even Israel’s western allies but the Israeli government has repeatedly said that military pressure on Hamas is essential to persuade it to give up its remaining hostages.
