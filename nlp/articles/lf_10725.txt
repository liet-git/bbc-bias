T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. A member of the Israeli Knesset says the ICJ interim ruling will not change the country's military strategy. Danny Danon told the BBC that Israel didn't have to change the way it's been conducting the war because it "already complied with it". "When you look at the decision of the court, we acted accordingly and we will report to the court," he said. He described the case as a "fake petition about fake genocide". "I'm glad the court didn't buy all the lies coming from South Africa. " Danon is not a member of Israel's war cabinet and has previously challenged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's leadership.
