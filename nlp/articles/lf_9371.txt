Abedalqader Hammad, a 59-year-old university lecturer, has just spoken to us on the phone from a market in Rafah. He told us: I’m in the market walking now with one of my sons, trying to find food for the family. The market is so crowded. You can hardly move in between all the people.  When searching for food, usually we find tins of chickpeas and beans. Today I’m trying to find something different - a new kind of food, so we can have a change from the food we’ve been eating for the past five months. I tried to buy chicken. Usually I wouldn’t eat frozen chicken. One kilogram of frozen chicken can cost me the equivalent of $20 (£15.75). And I need at least two chickens to feed my family. One kilogram of onions can cost $15. I need to buy Mulukhiyah [a type of vegetable], but each kilo is 20 shekels so two kilos will be 40 shekels or more than $10. So if I calculate what I need today for my family, I think it could cost me $71.  The things I need are available but in very small amounts. Some things go to the black market. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
