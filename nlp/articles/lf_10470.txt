T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Israel is calling this a precise, limited operation. To those inside Nasser hospital, listening to machine gunfire and stumbling along corridors filled with smoke, it feels very different. Medical sources say Israeli forces have fired into the hospital, killing a patient and wounding several others. Pictures from outside show civilians, who had been sheltering in the hospital grounds, apparently heeding Israeli instructions to leave the area. The Israelis say they have credible information that hostages, taken during the Hamas attacks of 7 October, have, at some point, been held inside the hospital. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
