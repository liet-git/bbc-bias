Disease is continuing to spread across the Gaza Strip, especially in overcrowded shelters. I sat down with Dr Marwan al-Hams, the director of the Martyr Mohammed Yusuf al-Najjar Hospital, in the southern city of Rafah. The hospital has 63 beds, and is caring for 145 patients, some of whom lay on the hospital floor as we spoke. Rafah is now home to around one million displaced Palestinians, on top of the pre-war population of 300,000. “The medical situation across Gaza but especially in Rafah is catastrophic,” Dr al-Hams tells me. He says hospitals are receiving patients with severe diarrhoea, fatigue and high temperature. There are also high rates of bacterial infections and skin diseases. Medicine to treat such conditions is hard to find. Food poisoning is another concern, linked to the lack of fresh drinking water and spread of water contaminated with sewage around displacement camps. “People are resorting to eating old bread. They wash it, dry it in in front of a fire or over a heater and then eat it. ”. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
