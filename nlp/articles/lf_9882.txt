T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. International pressure on Israel is certainly growing. Spanish politician Josep Borrell is the man who talks for the EU on foreign affairs: today he has suggested the international community may have to reconsider whether it should be supplying arms to Israel. Some of his language was quite striking. Basically, the EU chief was suggesting it's all very well some countries complaining that Israel is going too far, and saying they’re concerned by the number of civilians dying in Gaza, but - Borrell seemed to say - if you, as a country, are responsible arming Israel, shouldn’t you be thinking twice? Clearly it's a strategy he believes could make a significant difference. Those comments will be interpreted as being aimed at the US. They are the biggest supporter of Israel, both in terms of political weight they offer but also, more pertinently, in terms of the military hardware they supply. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
