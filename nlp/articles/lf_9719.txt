T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. A spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has recently spoken to our colleagues on the BBC News channel after it was announced that two officers had been fired. Lt Col Peter Lerner describes the strike on a convoy of trucks that killed seven aid workers in Gaza on Monday as an "immense human tragedy". But when put to him that "lethal force" was used on the basis of an "assumption" that Hamas gunmen had boarded the vehicles he says this is incorrect. "It wasn't an assumption, it was a visual confirmation of a gunman," he says, before saying there was a "miscalculation" and that "two senior officers - a major and a colonel - have been dismissed from their roles" as a result. "We're taking this incident very, very seriously," Lerner goes on, explaining how the situation on the ground shouldn't prevent humanitarian organisations doing their work. "We've clearly failed in this instance," he adds. Pushed to explain how Israel's military technology failed to identify the marked WCK vans, Lerner says night vision "couldn't identify" the NGO's sticker on the roof and it was then thought they were Hamas vehicles. "This is, again, another failure that we need to learn from . . . so this doesn't happen again in the future," he says. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
