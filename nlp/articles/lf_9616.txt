T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Israel has said it is reducing the number of soldiers in southern Gaza, which has prompted some Palestinians to return home to Khan Younis – a city that has been under Israeli bombardment for many months. Satellite images - taken before the troop withdrawal announcement was made - show armoured vehicles spread across the city, indicating that Israel had a significant military presence there. In the satellite image of western Khan Younis (above) - taken on 3 April - a row of military vehicles can be seen parked along the roadside. Other vehicles are parked in cleared areas surrounded by buildings. There are further vehicle clusters nearby, including a group located about 100m from al-Amal hospital. BBC Verify has not obtained high-resolution satellite images of the area since 3 April, so we can’t visually show how the IDF’s presence has altered since then. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
