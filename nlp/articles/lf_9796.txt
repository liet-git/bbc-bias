Dr Amjad Eliwah, deputy director of the emergency department at Al-Shifa, has told the BBC that his staff began hearing gunshots and what sounded like shell impacts at about 2.30am. Eliwah, who was due to begin his shift shortly after the raid began, spoke to the BBC from just outside the hospital grounds, form where he was in contact with his staff inside. He said the medical teams were hiding away from the windows after Israeli drones had fired at anyone moving. “Anyone in the grounds of the hospital were targeted,” he said. “There is a lot of injured, people are bleeding. My staff are hiding in the hallways – they were ordered by a loudspeaker not to move. ”. He said there were approximately 20 doctors and 60 nurses inside the hospital, as well as hundreds of patients. “The situation inside is very critical,” he said. The Israeli army also raided two schools next to the hospital that were being used as shelters by displaced people, Eliwah said, and arrested all the men inside and told the women to leave through a designated exit.
