T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Earlier we posted about a video showing Palestinian men detained by Israeli soldiers in Gaza. Israeli government spokesman Eylon Levy says the men had been detained in Jabalia and Shejaiya in northern Gaza, which he described as "Hamas strongholds and centres of gravity". "We're talking about military age men who were discovered in areas that civilians were supposed to have evacuated weeks ago," he says, before adding that they would be questioned to "work out who indeed was a Hamas terrorist and who is not". He emphasised the detained men had been found in areas where Israeli forces had engaged in "close-quarter combat" with Hamas. They had been "deliberately disguising themselves as civilians" and operating from civilian buildings. The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) has not directly commented on the images, but spokesman Daniel Hagari said on Thursday that "IDF fighters and Shin Bet officers detained and interrogated hundreds of terror suspects". "Many of them also turned themselves in to our forces during the past 24 hours. The intelligence coming out of their interrogations is utilised to continue the fighting. " The BBC has been told some of the men have now been released. Read the full updated story here. Pictures and video of the men detained by Israel in north Gaza have been circulating on social media.
