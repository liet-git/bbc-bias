By not publicly acknowledging responsibility for the strike - as is commonplace - Israel’s war cabinet may hope to make it more difficult for hard-line members of the governing coalition to criticise the limited nature of the attack, thus avoiding a political row over Passover. But that did not restrain some. Israel’s far-right National Security Minister, Itamar Ben Gvir, said a few days ago he wanted Israel to “go berserk” in response to Iran’s attack. This morning the minister - upon whose faction Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu depends - seemed less than impressed. On X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, he posted one word, best translated as: "Lame. ”. Israel’s opposition leader, Yair Lapid, hit back hard at this, posting: A security cabinet minister has never caused such heavy damage to the country’s security, image and international standing. With an unforgivable, one word tweet Ben Gvir managed to ridicule and embarrass Israel all the way from Tehran to Washington. Any other prime minister would have thrown him out of the cabinet this morning. " Itamar Ben Gvir. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
