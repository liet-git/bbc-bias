T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. In the UK, Foreign Secretary David Cameron has announced that "extremist settlers" responsible for violence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank will no longer be permitted to come to the UK. Posting on X, formerly Twitter, Cameron accused these settlers, by "targeting and killing Palestinian civilians", of "undermining security and stability for both Israelis and Palestinians". He goes on: Israel must take stronger action to stop settler violence and hold the perpetrators accountable. We are banning those responsible for settler violence from entering the UK to make sure our country cannot be a home for people who commit these intimidating acts. " It follows a similar ban announced by the US earlier this month , when Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he was taking action to target aggression by Israeli settlers on Palestinians. Attacks have surged in the occupied West Bank since the start of the war in the Gaza Strip, triggered by Hamas's assault on southern Israel on 7 October. Read more on settler violence here.
