Israel and Hamas have expressed cautious optimism following the latest round of talks aimed at securing ceasefire in Gaza. The Israeli foreign minister, Israel Katz, said talks in Cairo - which are being mediated by Egypt and Qatar – had reached a critical point, and he was increasingly optimistic a breakthrough may be possible. Any deal is likely to see the release of hostages being held in Gaza in return for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. However, we still don’t know whether key obstacles to a deal have been resolved. Hamas wants a permanent ceasefire – in other words, the end of the war – as well as the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and displaced residents allowed to return to the northern part of the enclave. So far, Israeli authorities have rejected those demands as unacceptable, saying it would give Hamas the opportunity to regroup, They insist on the need to launch an offensive in Rafah to destroy four Hamas units they maintain are based in the city. But in recent days they have indicated they are open to concessions. Prime Minister Netanyahu is facing international pressure to de-escalate the conflict, as well as opposition to the intended offensive in Rafah, where more than one million Palestinians are sheltering in precarious conditions. At home, in Israel, there are divisions inside the governing coalition, with some of Netanyahu's hard-line allies against any easing off of hostilities. But there is renewed pressure for a truce, especially from the US - a key ally for Israel - with CIA chief William Burns in Cairo for the talks. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
