With a busy afternoon of debate over the war in Gaza ahead in the Commons, let’s take a look at what MPs will actually be voting on: The SNPs motion calls for an “immediate ceasefire” in Gaza, saying it is the “only way to stop the slaughter of innocent civilians”. It also condemns the “collective punishment” of Palestinians. If passed, the opposition day motion would be non-binding on the government. Labour has proposed an amendment to this motion, which similarly calls for a ceasefire, but emphasises more the role of Hamas as well as Israel in bringing about a lasting pause in fighting. Meanwhile, a separate government amendment calls for an “immediate humanitarian pause”, backs Israel’s “right to self-defence”, and supports moves "towards a permanent sustainable ceasefire" As we've been telling you, we will find out later this morning which amendment (and it will likely be only one) goes to the floor of the Commons for a vote.
