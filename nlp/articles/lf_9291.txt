A woman in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis has been telling us she fled there in search of safety, but has found only danger. "Despite coming to Khan Younis for safety, it is not secure," the woman, who gave her name only as Um Saleh, said. She said she had tried to seek shelter in schools but had found them unsuitable to live in. We moved to places they claimed were safe but these supposed safe areas lacked safety, food, and essential necessities for survival. There was no food, no drink, and constant bombing. " "The situation in Khan Younis is very difficult. We were directed to move to the southern areas, where we now hear the sounds of tanks and bombs. " She added that she couldnâ€™t see anywhere safe in Gaza that she could escape to. "Where should we go? What do they want?" she asked. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
