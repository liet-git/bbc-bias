The United Nations estimates that around 35% of buildings in the Gaza Strip have been damaged or destroyed in the conflict with Israel. By analysing satellite imagery collected on 29 February and comparing with previous images of structures in the area, the United Nations Satellite Centre identified more than 31,000 destroyed buildings and almost 17,000 severely damaged buildings, with a further 40,762 moderately damaged structures. This represents an increase of nearly 20,000 damaged buildings since the analysis was last done in January. Other estimates have suggested the scale of destruction is even higher. Analysis carried out by Corey Scher of City University of New York and Jamon Van Den Hoek of Oregon State University in January suggests between 144,000 and 175,000 buildings across the whole Gaza Strip have been damaged or destroyed. That's between 50% and 61% of Gaza's buildings. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
