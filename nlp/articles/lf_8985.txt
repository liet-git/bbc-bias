T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Earlier we reported a warning from Israeli minister Benny Gantz to the Lebanese government that it needed to act to prevent Hezbollah's attacks on northern Israel. He said Israel would intervene if the militant group continued firing across the border. Lebanon has responded to the warning. Ambassador to the UK Rami Mortada told the BBC World Service's Newshour programme that Lebanon was "on the receiving end of the attacks" and "the party that should hold back is Israel". "We are not interested in escalation - all sides need to de-escalate," he said. Asked about Hezbollah's actions, he said it "has its own modus operandi". When pushed further, Mortada added: "I don't think now is the time to explain that modus operandi - they are represented in the Lebanese government and they take Lebanese interests into consideration. " In terms of the wider region, the "spillover from Gaza is very difficult to contain. . . we need an immediate ceasefire. . to stop the carnage" there, he said. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
