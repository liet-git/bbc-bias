T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. More now from that interview Rishi Sunak gave to reporters in Wales moments ago. The PM says it's still the government's position that there should be an "immediate humanitarian pause" in the Israel-Gaza war. "The government's position is very clear: We want to see an immediate pause in what's happening in Gaza so that we can get more aid in and crucially get the hostages out, including the British hostages," he says. That would create a foundation to build a "sustainable, lasting ceasefire," he adds, but it would involve Hamas having no part to play in future governance of Gaza. "We're also increasing our aid right now -  just last night for the first time, we dropped aid by air into a hospital in northern Gaza, making a difference on the ground to people who need that help," Sunak said. A reminder that the motion put forward by Labour last night called for an "immediate humanitarian ceasefire". We've explained the difference in this post here . The UK, in partnership with Jordan, dropped aid from the sky into Gaza overnight. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
