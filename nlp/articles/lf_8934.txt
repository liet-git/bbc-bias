The Israeli military has warned residents of al-Bureij refugee camp, in central Gaza, to evacuate south. It appears to indicate an expansion of Israel's ground operations in Gaza, as it continues its stated mission to destroy Hamas. "For your safety, you must move immediately to shelters in Deir Al-Balah," Avichay Adraee, of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), wrote on social media. Deir Al-Balah is a city also in centre of the strip, but it sits further south than Bureij. It's almost 11 weeks since the war began and 30% of Gaza has now been marked for evacuation on the Israeli militaryâ€™s online map, according to the UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. UNRWA, the UN's agency for Palestinian refugees, estimates that 1.9 million Gazans (85% of the population) are internally displaced. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
