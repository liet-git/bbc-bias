Jewish students at Colombia University in New York have been talking to the BBC World Service about their experiences being on campus during these protests.

Her classmate Ariana Pinkser-Lehrer thinks “some protestors are glorying Hamas which committed heinous violence against my people. This is not a peace movement. ”. Melissa Saidak, who is studying social work, says protestors shouted at her when they saw her wearing a dog tag in support of the hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. “I’ve been yelled at and called a Zionist which for them is a slur," she says, "and I've been called a murderer and a killer and a lot of assumptions have been made about me.
