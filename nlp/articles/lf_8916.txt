The US ambassador to the UN says "Hamas has no interest in lasting peace" in Gaza. Linda Thomas-Greenfield says the organisation is "determined to repeat the horrors" of 7 October "over and over". She adds that the US supports Israel's rights to "protect its people from acts of terror". Thomas-Greenfield notes the resolution "does not support any steps that would leave Hamas in power", which she says would "undermine the prospect of a two-state solution, where Gaza and the West Bank would be reunited" under a "revamped and revitalised Palestinian Authority". "We must work towards a future where Israelis and Palestinians can live side by side in peace, this is the only way forward," she adds. Thomas-Greenfield notes the US is "disappointed and appalled" that the resolution and some security council members failed to condemn the  "horrific terrorist attack" carried out by Hamas.
