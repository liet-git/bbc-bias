The leader of Hamas says the remaining hostages taken during the group's deadly cross-border attacks in southern Israel on 7 October will only be released under conditions set by the group itself. Speaking during a televised address, Ismail Haniyeh says Hamas has delivered its position to Qatar and Egypt - mediators in the conflict - which is based on "a complete cessation of the aggression" against Palestinians. Last month, Hamas ruled out any further hostage releases until the war ends . Israel has repeatedly rejected a permanent ceasefire and has vowed to destroy Hamas.
