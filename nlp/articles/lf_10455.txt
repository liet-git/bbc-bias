Since reports of a deadly incident in north western Gaza began to emerge early this morning, BBC Verify has been analysing footage of the aftermath to get a sense of what happened. One clip showing a number of heavily injured people - some lying motionless - on the back of a flatbed truck was filmed at Nablusi roundabout, on Rashid Street - a coastal road that runs across Gaza, north to south. Initial reports suggested that this roundabout was the scene of the incident, although footage shared subsequently appears to contradict this somewhat. One such clip shows three bodies loaded onto a cart around 300m away and heading towards the roundabout. The area in question has been used as an aid distribution point in recent weeks. Footage we've previously verified shows people gathering around trucks to claim sacks of grain. And just last night, an Instagram video showed a large number of people in the dark, huddled around bonfires, apparently awaiting the next aid shipment. Night-time video filmed in the same area and aired by Al Jazeera shows chaotic scenes as gunfire rings out. It is not immediately clear from the footage where the shots are coming from.
