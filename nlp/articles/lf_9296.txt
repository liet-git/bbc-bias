Intense fighting between Hamas and Israel in Gaza has prevented the distribution of aid in the southern city of Khan Younis, the UN has said. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said the only governorate in Gaza where aid distribution is taking place is Rafah, near the Egyptian border. While in Khan Younis, aid distribution has "largely stopped due to the intensity of hostilities", it said. The UN has struggled to receive incoming aid deliveries over the past three days because of a shortage of trucks in Gaza, the telecommunications blackout on Monday, and an increasing number of aid workers who were unable reach the Rafah crossing. And access to the north of Gaza from areas in the south of the territory was severed on 1 December, when the temporary ceasefire expired. According to the UN, nearly 1.9 million people in Gaza (nearly 85% of the population), are estimated to be displaced as of Sunday. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
