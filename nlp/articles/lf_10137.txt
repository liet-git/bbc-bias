T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he will do "whatever is necessary to restore security to the north" of Israel following recent exchanges of fire with Hezbollah over the border with Lebanon. Speaking to soldiers stationed on Israel's northern border, Netanyahu says his government "will do everything" to allow families "to return home safely" and know Israel cannot be "messed" with. "We will do whatever it takes. Of course, we prefer that this be done without a wide campaign, but that will not stop us," he adds. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
