Video footage has emerged of a strike on Tuesday close to an IDF-declared evacuation route for civilians fleeing targeted areas in Gaza. The highly graphic footage shows severe damage to several buildings, one of which has partially collapsed, and many casualties â€“ some covered by blankets or lying motionless on the ground. Several children appear to be among the victims. The BBC has verified the location of this strike in the town a Deir al-Balah, north of Khan Younis, from footage posted on X, formerly Twitter, yesterday evening. Comparing the layout of the buildings with satellite imagery of the area, the strike occurred about 250m from the IDF evacuation route along al-Shuhadaa Street. Each day this week, the IDF has issued statements in Arabic on X, with a map showing these designated "safe routes for the evacuation of civilians from Khan Younis", including along al-Shuhadaa Street. In the same message, the IDF made it clear the main Salah al-Din route north out of Khan Younis was no longer safe to travel. When we approached the IDF for comment, providing the location of the strike, we were directed to their earlier post on X , identifying the designated evacuation routes. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
