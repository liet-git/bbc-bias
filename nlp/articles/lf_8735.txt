The Eurovision Song Contest's organisers are condemning the abuse and harassment of artists over Israel's participation in the competition. Israel's contestant, Eden Golan, has been receiving death threats on Instagram, according to reports by celebrity website Walla Celebs. Jean Philip De Tender, Deputy Director General of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which organises Eurovision, says in a statement it is "unacceptable and totally unfair" for artists to receive online abuse. This year's competition will take place in Sweden next month amid pressure on other artists, including the UK's Olly Alexander, to boycott the competition due to Israel's war in Gaza. Eden Golan will represent Israel at the song contest in Sweden this May. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
