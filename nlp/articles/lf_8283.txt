Hot on the heels of Prime Minister’s Questions, the Scottish National Party (SNP) will be using an opposition day vote, to call for an immediate ceasefire in the Israel-Gaza war. Ten Labour frontbenchers quit in order to vote for the SNP's previous call for a ceasefire in November. Labour has since shifted its position - saying for the first time there should be an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. It's submitted an amendment to the SNP motion to try to avoid a repeat of the rebellion over the November vote. The party’s position is now practically much closer to the SNP’s - but Labour’s amendment emphasises to a greater extent the role of Hamas, as well as Israel, in bringing about a lasting ceasefire.
