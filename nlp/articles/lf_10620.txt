T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. The UK's most senior military officer says Israel’s war in Gaza, and wider tensions in the Middle East, “risk inflaming an arc of instability”. Admiral Sir Tony Radakin made the comments in his annual speech to the Royal United Services Institute. In the speech, he repeats the UK's support of Israel's right to defend itself, but says that fighting in such densely-packed areas risks "causing immense harm to civilians, which is why we have urged restraint". Adm Radakin adds he believes the impact on the wider region is "worrying”. He says the UK assessed that Iran "does not want a direct war" but Tehran is "comfortable with how events have unfolded" – with threats posed by Lebanon’s Hezbollah and Yemen’s Houthi’s, two groups Iran backs. “There are multiple scenarios in which this crisis could escalate," he says, adding that the US, whose forces in Iran and Syria have been targeted by militant groups, "had shown commendable restraint". But he says Britain’s allies in the Gulf were "nervous" – pointing to a perceived lack of engagement by the West over many years - specifically with a two-state solution for Palestinians.
