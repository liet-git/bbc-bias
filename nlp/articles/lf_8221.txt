Brendan O'Hara , the MP for Argyll and Bute, has now tabled the SNP motion, which calls for "an immediate ceasefire in Gaza for all combatants". O'Hara says there's an "unequivocal condemnation of the Hamas attack on 7 October and repeats both a call for the immediate release of all hostages and to see those involved in those atrocities called to account for their actions". He adds no-one denies that Israel has the right to defend itself, that every country has that right but says no country has the right "to lay siege to a civilian population, carpet-bomb densely inhabited areas, drive people from their homes, erase an entire civilian infrastructure and impose a collective punishment". No country "regardless of who they are" can kill civilians at such pace and scale in the name of self-defence, O'Hara says. SNP sets out case for 'immediate ceasefire' in Gaza. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
