It's put to Cameron that the opposition Labour Party is calling for more sanctions on Iran. He's asked if he agrees. Cameron says yes, and that the government has already placed 400 sanctions on Iran. A whole new sanctions regime was put in place at the end of last year, he says. The IRGC, Iran's Islamic Revolution Guard Corps, has been sanctioned in its entirety, Cameron adds. "We'll continue to look at what further steps we can do. " He says "all these things are more effective if countries can act together", adding that Iran is the "malign actor in the region and it's better if we can work together". T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
