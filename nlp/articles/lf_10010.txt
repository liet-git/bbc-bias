More now from Cameron, who's speaking to BBC Breakfast about the strikes Iran fired at Israel over the weekend. The foreign secretary is asked what restraint looks like from Israel's point of view. He says it's not having another wave of attacks, and instead putting pressure on Hamas to release hostages, pause fighting in Gaza and flood aid in. He says the situation needs to be de-escalated, while "getting the whole world to recognise what a malign influence Iran is in the region". Cameron adds that sanctions on Iran and other pressures need to be looked at. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
