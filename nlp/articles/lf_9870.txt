Good morning and welcome to our coverage of the 95th day of the war in Gaza. Today, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in Israel for talks - he's beginning with Israel's President Isaac Herzog. We'll have those quotes soon. Blinken is expected to press for more protection of Palestinian civilians and more humanitarian aid. Blinken began his latest Middle East tour last week - before leaving Saudi Arabia yesterday he warned against an escalation in the conflict. We'll have news and analysis and from our team of correspondents in London and on the ground - including our reporter Anthony Zurcher, who's travelling with Blinken. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
