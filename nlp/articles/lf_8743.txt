The UK will not suspend arms sales to Israel, Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron says . It follows mounting pressure on the government over its weapons trade with Israel, after an air strike which killed aid workers and the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Ministers have been asked whether legal advice deems Israel to have breached international humanitarian law. If it were considered to have done so, it could ultimately bar arms sales from the UK. During a US State Department news conference Lord Cameron said the latest assessment of Israeli conduct “leaves our position on export licences unchanged”. He added the UK had “grave concerns” about humanitarian access but said “no like-minded countries” had suspended arms exports to Israel – which remained a “vital” defensive partner to the UK. Labour suggested the government's position was "simply not good enough". On radio station LBC this morning Prime Minister Rishi Sunak repeated the position but described the situation in Gaza as “increasingly intolerable”. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
