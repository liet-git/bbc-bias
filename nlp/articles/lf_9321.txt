One way of measuring what is happening in Gaza is to look at what the US have said very clearly they want the Israelis to do. That is: to kill fewer Palestinian civilians, to fight in a different way, not to cause displacements of large numbers of people in what is a very small area. But on all those points, the Israelis are not doing what the Americans say. It’s politically awkward for US President Joe Biden, but I think Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is calculating that they can go their own way and the Americans will continue to support them. And if you look at the scale of what they are doing in Gaza, the Israelis have said that yesterday they carried out 250 air strikes. Being even a mile away from just one air strike is pretty appallingly terrifying - 250 is an entirely different degree of impact. And I think one of the purposes of that, apart from their stated top priority of pursuing Hamas, is that they want to show the population that when the Israelis say "move" - you need to move. They have declared today there will be a pause around the middle of the day to allow people to relocate. But this is essentially – as one UK government minister said – kettling people into smaller and smaller areas. And as the UN has said, because of what’s going on, it is no longer meaningful to describe the aid operation there as being effective. They can no longer get to the people who need help and they are not able to supply what’s required – it sounds really chaotic, difficult and dangerous. And the Israelis, despite the pressure from the Americans, are going full speed ahead. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
