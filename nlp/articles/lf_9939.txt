Israel’s war cabinet will have been debating two key questions in response to Iran’s missile attacks at the weekend: how to respond and when. Because the timing here matters. There are those like Benny Gantz, the former military chief, who have called for a firm and immediate response, just as Israel did within hours of the 7 October attack by Hamas. Their argument is that Israel needs to show strength and react now while the world’s memory of Iran’s barrage of missiles is still fresh. The other side of the argument is that, partly in order to keep Israel’s international allies onside, it needs to listen to their calls for restraint and hold off, at least for now, while tensions are so high. There are profound fears in the region, even among governments that dislike Iran, that an Israeli attack now on the Islamic Republic will inflame those tensions and prompt further retaliation by Iran leading to a dangerous escalation that could even drag in the US. Those arguing for restraint by Israel point out that, despite the undoubted threat posed by Iran’s missiles and drones, when it comes to casualties nobody died in that attack. By contrast, the presumed Israeli air strike on Iran’s Consulate building in Damascus on 1 April killed 13 people, including two top generals. Hence the advice given to Israel by President Biden: “Take the win. ”. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
