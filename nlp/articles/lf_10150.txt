The Wall Street Journal has been speaking to the Israeli Defence Minister, Yoav Gallant, ahead of the arrival of the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Tel Aviv. His comments to the US newspaper amount to a staunch defence of Israel’s conduct of the war in Gaza. Gallant suggests the intensity of the offensive is due to “the gravity of the threat” posed by Hamas but also shows determination “to act with enough force to deter other potential adversaries allied with Iran, including Hezbollah in neighbouring Lebanon. ”. The minister, who sits in Israel’s war cabinet, says his country is beginning to make a shift from intensive combat to special operations in Gaza. At the same time, he warns this stage of the conflict "will last for a longer time". Gallant also signals Israel’s defence posture has changed in the wake of the 7 October attacks. “My basic view: We are fighting an axis, not a single enemy,” he says. “Iran is building up military power around Israel in order to use it. ”.
