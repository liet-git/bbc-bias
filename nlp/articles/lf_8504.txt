As we have been reporting, Gazans in the southern city of Rafah have been leaving for the western parts of the enclave ahead of an expected Israeli offensive. Here is what has been happening so far: Israeli tanks have encircled an area in the east of Rafah , after telling residents to leave. About 300,000 Gazans had moved towards Al-Mawasi since Monday, the IDF said. The military has bombarded parts of eastern Rafah and reported “face-to-face battles” in the city. This morning, the Israeli army called on more neighbourhoods in Rafah to evacuate to western parts of the Gaza Strip. UN humanitarian agencies say they will run out of food for south Gaza today, after the closure of Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings. At least 34,971 people have been killed in Gaza since the start of the war on 7 October, the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry said on Saturday. Displaced Palestinians are evacuating a tent camp in Rafah ahead of the Israeli offensive. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
