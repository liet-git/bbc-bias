It's been an intense day of fighting in Gaza as the Israeli army continues to push into Khan Younis, where tens of thousands of displaced people have been sheltering. Here's a look at what has been happening the last few hours: Israeli forces have encircled      the home of Yahya Sinwar, head of the Hamas’s political wing in Gaza ,      who Israel believes to be one of the masterminds behind the 7 October      attacks, according to the Israeli PM. Despite the pressure on      Israel to avoid civilian casualties and displacement, UNRWA said it had      seen "no recalibration" of the country’s tactics as      it pushes through southern Gaza. UN agencies said      humanitarian assistance had been "reduced virtually to nothing"      raising fears of widescale hunger and disease for Gaza's      2.2 million people as intense fighting prevented the distribution      of aid in Khan Younis today. Journalists in Gaza have      told the BBC about the desolate conditions in the enclave and      the impossible choices they face covering the conflict in their homeland. Israel’s military said it      intercepted a surface-to-surface missile that was launched towards      Israel over the Red Sea and that it has been launching attacks on      targets in Lebanon.
