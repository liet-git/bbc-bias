Finally, Laura refers to new allegations in the newspapers this morning over whether shadow deputy prime minister Angela Rayner paid the proper tax on the sale of her home some years ago. Rayner refuses to publish the advice she was given that she says shows no wrongdoing, Laura says. Why doesn’t she publish it so she can “move on”, Laura asks? There is nothing new in this story this morning, Lammy says. He goes on to say she has a "blended family" and did spend time in her husband’s home. It is “perfectly understandable” she would balance childcare between two homes. She took the appropriate advice, hasn’t broken any laws and it is a “non story”, he says. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
