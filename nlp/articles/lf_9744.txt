In the last few moments, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who is meeting EU leaders in Belgium, has welcomed efforts from Israel to allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza. But he said success would be measured in results on the ground. "Really the proof is in the results, and we will see those unfold in the coming days, in the coming weeks," he says. Blinken says the US will be monitoring how many trucks carrying aid are getting in and around the territory, as well as the risk of famine. He says Israel needs to be "maximising every effort to protect civilians", adding that the US is looking to see accountability for the Israeli strike on the World Central Kitchen aid convoy, which killed seven workers, including a US-Canadian citizen, earlier this week.
