Today's operation at the Nasser hospital comes after days of warnings from the IDF that it is considering invading Gaza's southernmost city of Rafah. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to defeat Hamas battalions he says are hiding in the city on the Egyptian border with the strip. The city of Rafah is about 5 miles (9km) from the Nasser hospital and where many people displaced from the hospital after the evacuation have fled. Over a million people are sheltering in the city, according to the United Nations, which warns an assault could lead to "slaughter". A spokesperson for UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has told the BBC that the UN has not received any Rafah evacuation plans from Israel and will not participate in any forced evacuation. Pressure has been ramping up on Israel in recent days, from both aid agencies and allied countries like the US and UK, to avoid a full-scale ground operation in Rafah. UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron said Israel should "stop and think seriously" before taking further action in Rafah. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
