Blinken begins his address by saying this is his fourth trip to Israel in the 95 days since the 7 October attack. He says time moves differently for those deeply affected, such as families of hostages living with separation, and for the hundreds of thousands facing food insecurity in Gaza. This immense human toll is one of the many reasons we continue to stand with Israel to ensure the attack on 7 October can never happen again, he says. It's the reason are working urgently towards forging a path towards lasting peace in the region, he says. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
