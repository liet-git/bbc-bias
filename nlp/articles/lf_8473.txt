T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Mark Regev, senior adviser to the Israeli prime minister, has given some details on how the difficulties of combat in Gaza could have led to the IDF mistakenly killing the three hostages held by Hamas. Asked what the IDF's rules of engagement are - which officials say its forces went against in killing the hostages - Regev says some have to be kept confidential because "Hamas is listening to our conversations". "But it's clear we don't want to kill the innocent or our hostages. "One problem we face is that Hamas don't wear uniforms, they wear civilian clothes, they are terrorists. There have been incidents in the past where they supposedly surrender and then attack our forces. "Suddenly you think an area is clean and someone comes out of a door or underground tunnel and fires at our forces. " He says "there has to be action taken" if IDF soldiers broke its rules of engagement. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
