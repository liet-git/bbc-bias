T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. We've been hearing from the BBC's former Middle East correspondent Jim Muir, who has been commenting on Israel's intensifying operations in Rafah. He tells BBC Radio 5 live that: “The Americans do not want to see a big operation" in the city and adds "there will be more arms withheld if it sees that going on". Muir continues by saying "the writing is on the wall for the Israelis" and says he "never thought they would do one massive push". "What they are doing is what I'm calling ‘salami tactics’; where they're [taking Gaza] sort of slice-by-slice," he says. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
