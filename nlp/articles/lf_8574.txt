The government is coming under growing cross-party pressure to halt arms sales to Israel. Britain does not sell a great deal of weapons or ammunition to Israel. The Campaign Against The Arms Trade says that since 2008, the UK granted arms export licenses to Israel worth only a little more than 500 million pounds. Lord Ricketts, a former national security adviser, told the BBC that the UK should halt arms sales to Israel. Sir Alan Duncan, the former Conservative foreign minister, also said Israel was breaching international humanitarian law and continued UK arms sales could not be justified. David Lammy, the Shadow Foreign Secretary, said the government should publish its current legal advice about whether Israel was complying with international humanitarian law. And if there was a clear risk of a breach, then arms sales should be suspended. The Lib Dem leader, Sir Ed Davey, believes the government should take “swift action” to halt exports now, and the SNP said parliament should be recalled so MPs can vote on ending arms sales to Israel. But a senior government source told the BBC that an arms embargo on Israel was “not going to happen”. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
