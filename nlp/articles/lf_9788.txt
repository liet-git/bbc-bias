Dr Amer Jedbeh, a 31-year-old surgical resident, has been speaking to the BBC from the hallway of the surgical building inside al-Shifa. “We are trapped where we are inside the department,” he says. “A shell hit our building on the first floor, injuring several people. One man died – we could not save him. We are working only with first aid, essentially, we cannot operate because there is no electricity or water. ”. Dr Jedbeh says he had been able to go into the ICU because it was in the same building, and two life support patients there had died because the electricity was killed ahead of the beginning of the raid. “All the machinery is off,” he explains, adding that it was impossible to move between buildings. “Colleagues from the main building say there are many injured there who need surgery but we cannot get to them and they cannot bring the patients to us. ”. Dr Jedbeh says he was on a short rest break when the assault began at 2am, and that an hour later, the Israeli army used a loudspeaker to instruct everyone in the hospital to stand away from the windows and not move from their position. “The condition here is very critical, we have badly wounded people but no way to treat them. The shooting is still happening, there has been no let up since 2am," he says. "If a bullet costs them one dollar, it sounds like they have spent three million dollars this night. ”. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
