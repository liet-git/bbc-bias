T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. The safety of hundreds of thousands of children in Rafah will be compromised if Israel goes ahead with a planned offensive in the area, according to a UK charity. In a statement describing grave concerns for the young in Rafah, Gemma Sherrington, Interim CEO at Save the Children UK, said there was "nowhere safe to go". "These aren't just our words, but those of the foreign secretary, who has repeatedly said how concerned he is about an incursion into Rafah. This is where we find out if that concern adds up to anything at all. " In February, UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron said Israel should "stop and think seriously" before taking further action in Rafah. Sherrington called on the UK to do all that it could to stop the planned incursion, including suspending arms sales to Israel and demanding an immediate ceasefire. â€œFor children in Gaza, this offensive could be the deadliest and most destructive chapter of the conflict yet. They need actions, not words. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
