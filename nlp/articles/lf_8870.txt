T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. In one of the strongest comments by a US official about the Israeli tactics in Gaza so far, Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said a “gap” remained between the intention of protecting civilians and what is actually happening on the ground. Pressure is mounting from Israel’s main ally,  the US, to do more to protect Gaza’s population. As the Israeli military advances in southern Gaza, the number of Palestinians being killed is rising fast, hospitals are overwhelmed and unable to treat everyone, while tens of thousands of people are on the move, many not for the first time. The Israeli authorities say they have taken measures to protect the population, including by publishing information online of areas to be evacuated and where to go. Aid groups say this is a system that does not work while residents say nowhere is safe, a view shared by UN officials and rejected by Israel. As the fighting continues, the humanitarian crisis is worsening, with widespread shortages of food, water and medicine amid limited deliveries of aid. Blinken’s comments follows several high-profile interventions in recent days about the civilian toll of Israel’s war against Hamas. A dramatic warning came from Lloyd Austin, the US Secretary of Defence, last weekend: Israel risked driving Gaza’s population into the arms of the enemy, turning a tactical victory into a strategic defeat.
