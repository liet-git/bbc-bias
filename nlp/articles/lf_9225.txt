This Gaza war, unprecedented in scope, has now been raging for two months. The Hamas-run health ministry says more 17,000 people have been killed, including thousands of children. Israel’s military operation in the southern Gaza Strip, currently focussed on the largest city there, Khan Younis, is making a difficult humanitarian situation worse. The UN says 80% of the population has been displaced. People are running out of safe havens and not enough aid is getting in. Speaking in Geneva, the UN’s top aid official, Martin Griffiths, gave this bleak assessment. Griffiths said negotiations were under way with Israel to improve the flow of aid. Israeli officials say are willing to do what they can, to increase the amount of aid coming in and to facilitate the opening of additional field hospitals to help cope with the vast number of casualties. On his first visit to the region since the crisis began, the UK Defence Secretary, Grant Schapps, said other routes were being looked at that could involve the Royal Navy. With fighting raging around Khan Younis and in the north, images are circulating on social media showing dozens of Palestinian men, stripped to their underwear, kneeling on the ground, being guarded by Israeli soldiers. Other pictures show them being transported in military trucks. Israel’s chief military spokesman, Daniel Hagari, said hundreds of what he called terror suspects had been detained and that many had given themselves up. But already one well-known Palestinian journalist has been identified among those being held. Israel's military operations in Gaza continue. Pro-Palestinian protesters marched in Sydney on Thursday.
