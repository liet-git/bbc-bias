Good morning and welcome as we resume our live coverage of the Israel-Gaza war. It's just gone 6.40 here in London and 08:40 in Israel and Gaza. Here's a quick rundown of the latest lines: The US says "serious negotiations" are taking place on a new Gaza truce and the release of more Israeli hostages. But prospects of a new pause in fighting and the release of hostages remain uncertain after Hamas's leader reportedly rejected the prospect of a temporary pause during talks in Cairo on Wednesday. Israeli forces say theyâ€™ve uncovered a network of tunnels in the heart of Gaza City with entrances connected to the houses of Hamas leaders. On Wednesday, the Hamas-run Gaza government said 20,000 people had been killed there since Israel launched its military campaign against the group. And the UN Security Council again postponed a meeting to discuss calls for "urgent humanitarian pauses" in Gaza. Stay with us for the latest news and analysis from us here in London and our correspondents in the region. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
