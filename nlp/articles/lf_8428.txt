The World Health Organization’s Sean Casey has just returned from a visit to the Al-Shifa hospital in northern Gaza, where they’ve been delivering much needed medical supplies and equipment. Speaking to me from Gaza on the BBC News Channel he painted a desperate picture of a hospital which is barely able to function. Mr Casey said the hospital wards looked “almost like a battlefield hospital” with patients everywhere, and “blood all over the floors”. He said the medical staff who remain at the hospital are “completely overwhelmed”, as they treat a range of the injured from children with open wounds, babies with jaundice, and a range of other injuries and ailments including blast injuries and fractures. Limited fuel, oxygen and staffing is making an already challenging task even harder. Illustrating these difficulties, Mr Casey described how children are holding up IV fluid bags for their brothers and sisters and parents. On top of all the patients who are “streaming in every 30-60 seconds”, there are many who have taken shelter in the hospital. Mr Casey and his team are some of the few who’ve had access to the Al-Shifa hospital in recent weeks. People crowd around the exterior of Al-Shifa Hospital. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
