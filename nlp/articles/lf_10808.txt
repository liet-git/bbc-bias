As the Israel-Hamas war enters its third month, fierce battles are continuing in the Gaza Strip. Here are some of the key developments from today: Israeli tanks are continuing their advance towards the centre of Khan Younis , the largest city in the south and the centre of much of the recent fighting. Israel has been urging citizens to move to a "humanitarian zone" in al-Mawasi - a narrow strip of land with few buildings. A hospital director in the city told the BBC that staff are struggling to cope with the number of injured people arriving, and that there is a shortage of medical supplies, food, water and fuel. The Hamas-run health ministry in the Gaza Strip said more than 18,200 Palestinians have been killed since the war began on 7 October, with almost 50,000 people injured. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called for more Hamas fighters to surrender to IDF forces, and said that now is the “beginning of the end for Hamas” . However, a military analyst has told the BBC that predictions of Hamas’s imminent demise are “wildly optimistic”. The UN’s agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, has said there is “almost a total breakdown of civil order” around its aid deliveries in Gaza . Juliette Touma, its communications director, said there have been several incidents of warehouses being broken into and supplies taken. Palestinians inspect the rubble of a destroyed house following Israeli airstrikes on Al Maghazi refugee camp, southern Gaza Strip. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
