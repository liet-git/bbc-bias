T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has pulled a major division out of Khan Younis and the Gaza Strip, as Palestinians have begun returning to what is left of their homes the southern city. Israeli media reports say this leaves a much smaller number of troops in Gaza, deployed in the north. Defence Minister Yoav Gallant has said the withdrawal was to enable the military to prepare for further missions, including a widely criticised plan to invade the southern city of Rafah, which Israel says is still a Hamas stronghold. Meanwhile, talks are taking place in Cairo with delegations from Israel, Hamas, Qatar and the US attempting to secure a ceasefire deal. Weâ€™ll be covering all these lines and more from our newsroom in London, with a team of correspondents deployed across the region bringing in live analysis throughout the day. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
