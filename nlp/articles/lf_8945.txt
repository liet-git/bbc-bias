A key development from yesterday, as we said in our last post, was Hamas ruling out any more hostage releases until Israel agrees to a "full cessation of aggression". A truce last month saw more than 100 hostages freed by Hamas, but around 120 more abducted from Israel on 7 October are believed to be still in captivity in Gaza. In a statement, Hamas said: There is a Palestinian national decision that there should be no talk about prisoners or exchange deals except after a full cessation of aggression. " It is unclear to which other Palestinian factions the statement was referring. Islamic Jihad, a smaller group in the Gaza Strip, is among those known to also be holding Israeli hostages. The statement puts the Israeli government in a difficult position. It has said it thinks the best way to get the release of hostages is military pressure on Hamas and by staging rescue operations. But so far only one hostage - Ori Megidish - has actually been rescued. Read more on this here. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
