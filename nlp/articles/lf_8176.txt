T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. A source close to the Speaker has said the suggestion that he was pressured by the Labour party to select their Gaza amendment was "absolutely untrue". The source said the Speaker did not make the decision lightly - and was deeply aware of the emotion surrounding this debate and members' passion about it. The source added that the Speaker recognised that members, their families and their staff were under a lot of pressure and was mindful of their safety. He wanted to make sure as many members as possible could have their voices heard, rather than them "going back to their constituencies without having been able to express themselves", the source said.
