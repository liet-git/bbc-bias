"If any of our own countries had been attacked in this way, we would all expect this council to reaffirm our rights to protect our citizens," he says. He adds that the most unrealistic part of the resolution is its call for an "unconditional ceasefire". He says this would "simply leave Hamas in place, able to regroup and repeat what it did on 7 October". "This resolution essentially says that Israel should just tolerate this, that it should allow this terror to go unchecked. " He calls this stance "a recipe for disaster, for Israel, for the Palestinians, and for the entire region. " The US representative then reiterated what President Joe Biden has previously said on the matter, that a two-state solution is the only way to achieve lasting peace. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
