Speaking during a campaign walkabout near Nelson Mandela's home in Soweto, President Cyril Ramaphosa quoted the late leader: "We will not be completely free until the people of Palestine are free. " Former President Mandela was an ardent proponent of Palestinian nationhood. Ramaphosa said he taught South Africans about the connection with Palestinians. "A lack of justice for Palestine was also a lack of justice for South Africa," he said. Foreign ministry chief Zane Dangor described the ruling as "groundbreaking", referring to the fact it was the first time the court had made an explicit order to Israel to halt its actions in a part of Gaza. "We hope the UN Security Council takes note of this," he said, adding that South Africa will be approaching the UNSC with the order. As a reminder, South Africa brought the original case before the ICJ that has led to today's provisional measures. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
