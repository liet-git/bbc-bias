Juliette Touma, communications director for the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugee (UNRWA) and has raised concerns about disruption of getting aid to the northern part of Gaza. "Children are dying of hunger," she tells BBC News. "Any organisation which delivers assistance to people in Gaza is key. "Any disruption will have severe consequences on a population which is already going through quite a lot. " Her comments come as two US-based charities - World Central Kitchen (WCK) and the American Near East Refugee Aid (Anera) - say they are freezing operations in Gaza following last night's fatal strike. "We need to coordinate with the Israel authorities. On three different occasions we have had our convoys hit by Israeli forces," she adds. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
