The BBC has seen and heard evidence of rape, sexual violence and mutilation of women during the 7 October Hamas attacks. Several people involved in collecting and identifying the bodies of those killed in the attack told us they had seen multiple signs of sexual assault, including broken pelvises, bruises, cuts and tears, and that the victims ranged from children and teenagers to pensioners. Video testimony of an eyewitness at the Nova music festival, shown to journalists by Israeli police, detailed the gang rape, mutilation and execution of one victim. Videos of naked and bloodied women filmed by Hamas on the day of the attack, and photographs of bodies taken at the sites afterwards, suggest that women were sexually targeted by their attackers. Few victims are thought to have survived to tell their own stories. You can read the full story here. "We see women of all ages. . . We see the bruises, we learn about the cuts and tears, and we know they have been sexually abused," Captain Maayan told the BBC. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
