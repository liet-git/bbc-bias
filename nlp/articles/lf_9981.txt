The involvement of Israel's allies in helping defend Israel from Iran's attack on Saturday allowed both countries "a face-saving way out" of the escalating violence, says Mohammad Ali Shabani, editor of Amwaj media, which provides in-depth analyses of the region. He tells the BBC that Iran has been able to claim victory by saying it took unprecedented action against Israel, but that Israel could also claim victory by saying that it defended most of the attack. He says Iran's attack was carefully choreographed and telegraphed in advance, but things will be very different if things escalate. "There will be no advanced warning, there will be no choreographing, drones probably will not only be launched from Iran and most importantly of all, Iran's regional allies will also participate, and in such a scenario I think very easily a group such as Hezbollah in Lebanon can overwhelm the Israeli air defences," he says.
