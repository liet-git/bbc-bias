If you are just joining us, the US has vetoed a draft resolution at the UN Security Council calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza. The US, a permanent member of the security council, has the power to block any motion that comes before the council. Its ally, the UK, voted to abstain, while 13 other member nations voted in favour. The draft resolution was put forward by the United Arab Emirates and was co-sponsored by 97 member nations. After the resolution failed, the US sought to defend its decision, while others went on the attack. The US called the resolution "imbalanced" and "divorced from reality," adding that it did not include language that they had requested, including a clear condemnation of Hamas' 7 October attacks on Israeli civilians. They also reiterated a call for a two-state solution as the only way to achieve lasting peace in the region. The UK also echoed the US, saying it could not vote in favour of a resolution that does not condemn "the atrocities Hamas committed". The US veto was criticised by China and Russia. Beijing accused the US of being "self-contradictory" by refusing to support a draft for a ceasefire while expressing concern for civilian lives, while Russia called the US "heartless". Brazil , which supported the draft resolution, said it fears that a two-state solution will be "irreparably" harmed without urgent action in Gaza. The State of Palestine , which has permanent observer status at the UN, called the failure to pass the resolution "a turning point in history" and accused the security council of failing to uphold its responsibility in the face of mounting Palestinian civilian deaths.
