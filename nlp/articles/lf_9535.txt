Earlier, we reported a second humanitarian organisation in Gaza - the American Near East Refugee Aid (Anera) - has also paused operations, along with the World Central Kitchen (WCK), following last night's Israeli air strike which killed seven aid workers. The charity's president Sean Carroll says the decision to freeze its operations was not taken easily. "This (attack) is really, really hard to stomach, to understand. These are our partners, our friends. . . it's very hard, it's inexplicable, it can't be justified," Carroll tells BBC World Service's Newshour . "I think the world has to scratch its head and ask really hard questions about how this could happen. " He says it's the first time in 56 years of working in the Palestinian Occupied Territories that it's paused operations. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
