Videos from inside Jenin’s Old City, in the occupied West Bank, show several bodies lying on the ground, a few people gathered around them. Witnesses say they were hit by a drone strike. Hospitals in Jenin have confirmed four people were killed, and at least one other is thought to have been seriously wounded. Israel's army is also operating inside Jenin Camp – residents filming from inside their houses have shared videos of soldiers moving through cautiously the streets in full body armour with their weapons raised. The operation there – which is still ongoing – includes several armoured bulldozers which have been pushing their way through the narrow streets, taking local vehicles with them. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
