T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Israel's President Isaac Herzog has shared his reaction to the ICC announcement, describing it as "beyond outrageous" and saying it "shows the extent to which the international judicial system is in danger of collapsing". He says it is a "one-sided move" which "represents a unilateral political step that emboldens terrorists around the world, and violates all the basic rules of the court". Hitting out at Hamas, Herzog goes on to say that "any attempt to draw parallels between these atrocious terrorists and a democratically elected government of Israel. . . is outrageous" and cannot be accepted. We will not forget our hostages whose safe return should be the main concern of the international community.  We expect all leaders in the free world to condemn outright this step and firmly reject it. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
