T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Israel’s army has accused Hamas of using “civilian infrastructure” to launch its operations. It said the group had used an UNRWA school and a mosque in Beit Hanoun in northern Gaza to fire at its forces. Juliette Touma, UNRWA’s director of communications, told the BBC she could not verify the claims because the area around it was “constantly bombed”, but reiterated that schools should be “protected at all times” and should “never be used for military or fighting purposes”. Rockets have been seen fired from the Gaza Strip this week. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
