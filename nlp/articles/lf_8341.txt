It's just gone 13:00 here in London and 15:00 in Israel and Gaza. Here's a recap of what's been happening today: Hamas says Palestinian groups have rejected the prospect of more hostages being released until Israel agrees to end the war in Gaza. The group's statement comes as talks continue in Cairo, Egypt, to try to broker a new truce in the conflict and secure the release of more Israeli hostages – about 120 are still believed to be in captivity. The UN Security Council is again due to hold a vote on a resolution calling for pause in fighting in Gaza. The vote has already been delayed three times - most recently on Wednesday - as diplomats seek wording that won't be vetoed by the US. Elsewhere, the World Health Organization says northern Gaza now doesn’t have a functioning hospital due to lack of fuel, staff and supplies. Israel’s military says it has found a network of tunnels in Gaza City which connect to the homes of Hamas leaders. Stay with us as we continue to bring you live updates. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
