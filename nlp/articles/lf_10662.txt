The prime ministers of Australia, New Zealand and Canada have voiced their support for a "sustainable  ceasefire" in Gaza. "We want to see this pause resumed and support urgent international efforts towards a sustainable ceasefire," the three said in a joint statement . "This cannot be one-sided. Hamas must release all hostages, stop using Palestinian civilians as human shields, and lay down its arms. There is no role for Hamas in the future governance of Gaza. " After dire warnings from aid workers about the deepening humanitarian crisis in Gaza, the UN General Assembly passed a resolution calling for an end to the current fighting late on Tuesday - Australia, Canada and New Zealand were included in the 153 member states who all voted in favour. The US was one of ten nations who voted against the proposal, while 23 countries, including the UK abstained. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
