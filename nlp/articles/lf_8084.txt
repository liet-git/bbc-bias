T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Former immigration minister Robert Jenrick claims the events from yesterday evening was not about party politics, but instead "that this House appears cowed by threats of violence and intimidation". He says Parliament appears weak and goes on to claim that Britain has been "dominated" by "Islamist extremists" and that British Jews are "intimidated" and scared to walk down the street. He is now asking that a debate be held on tackling extremism. Penny Mordaunt says she could not agree more with the Tory MP's observations. She says there is "tremendous" work ongoing to "protect democracy" and says she will ensure the Home Secretary James Cleverly hears Jenrick's remarks. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
