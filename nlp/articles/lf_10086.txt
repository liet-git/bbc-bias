The first sign an attack was imminent came during the evening when the Israeli army announced its forces were on full alert and dozens of warplanes were in the air. Authorities said mass gatherings and educational activities were to be restricted. And then an army spokesman confirmed the rumours: Iranian drones had been launched and were bound for Israel. Across the rooftops of Jerusalem, we heard sirens. Explosions lit up the night as Iron Dome air defence missiles soared into the sky. The IDF reported similar alerts across the country. It soon became clear armed forces of allies and partners were helping to intercept many of the drones and missiles before they reached Israel. Inevitably, some got through, causing what Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari – a spokesman for Israel’s army - said was “minor damage” to a military base. There were few reports of casualties, apart from one girl who was critically injured. Israel’s war cabinet met overnight, with one official saying there would be a “significant response”.
