T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. More now on Natalie Elphicke's defection and the story this morning which details allegations the Dover MP lobbied ministers over her then-husband Charlie's sexual assault case. In case you missed it, Elphicke is accused of asking Sir Robert Buckland , the then justice secretary, to help move the date of the case. Laura asks Ashworth if the lobbying claims should be investigated. Ashworth highlights that Elphicke says the allegations are "nonsense", adding: "I do not understand why the Lord chancellor is raising this now," he says. He says Elphicke shifted to Labour because she believes the Tory government is "disintegrating". T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
