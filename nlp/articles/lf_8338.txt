UK Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron is on a visit to Egypt, looking at ways to help bring more aid into Gaza, including a possible new sea route. He said the UK was also pressing for a UN Security Council resolution to improve humanitarian access. Voting has been repeatedly delayed this week, as the US – Israel’s closest ally has insisted on changes - another attempt at the vote is scheduled for today. New discussions are now under way on a pause in fighting that could see more of the 100 Israeli hostages still held by Hamas released. So far, Hamas has said it will only free them if there’s a full ceasefire. Today, there’s been intense Israeli bombing particularly in the north of Gaza where the UN’s health agency says it’s seen hundreds of seriously wounded patients waiting for days without treatment.
