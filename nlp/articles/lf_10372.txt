We're hearing more now about US President Joe Biden's phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Biden "reiterated his clear position on Rafah" during the call, according to the official US readout of the meeting. Washington has repeatedly said it does not support an invasion of Rafah without a plan to help the civilians sheltering there. It adds that Netanyahu has "agreed to ensure the Kerem Shalom crossing is open for humanitarian assistance for those in need" - that's the crossing where four Israeli soldiers were killed in a Hamas rocket attack on Sunday. The two leaders also discussed the "shared commitment of Israel and the United States to remember the six million Jews who were systematically targeted and murdered in the Holocaust. . . and to forcefully act against antisemitism and all forms of hate-fueled violence," said the statement, noting that the conversation took place as Israel marked Yom HaShoah, Holocaust Remembrance Day.
