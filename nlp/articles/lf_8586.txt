A spokesperson for Human Rights Watch, a non-governmental organisation with headquarters in New York City, says the decision taken by prosecutor Karim Khan is a "principled first step" which "opens the door to those responsible for the atrocities committed in recent months to get a fair trial". Balkees Jarrah, associate international justice director, says seeking the arrest warrants "in the face of pressure from US lawmakers and others reaffirms the crucial role" of the court. "ICC member countries should stand ready to resolutely protect the ICC’s independence as hostile pressure is likely to increase while the ICC judges consider Khan’s request," she adds. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
