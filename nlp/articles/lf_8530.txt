The decision over arms exports to Israel is exposing divisions within the Conservative Party - which holds government in the UK - over the conflict in Gaza. Conservative MPs such as Flick Drummond, David Jones and Paul Bristow, as well as party grandees Lord Soames and Lord Swire, have called on the government to suspend arms export licences to the Middle Eastern country. But other Conservatives I've spoken to say it's a "ridiculous call", with one MP telling me: “Are Tehran cutting off arms to Hamas and Hezbollah? Of course not. So it would be an act of utter stupidity for the West to pull support for the region’s only liberal democracy whilst Iran continues to arm and fund the terrorist rape and murder cults that surround them. ”. Technically, it's up to the business secretary to decide on issuing arms export licences. However, one MP familiar with the process said that in reality - because revoking arms licences to Israel would be so sensitive - the decision would be taken by the Cabinet, and ultimately the prime minister. So Rishi Sunak will have a difficult decision to make. Suspending arms export licences to Israel would have little practical impact on the war in Gaza. Business Minister Greg Hands has previously told MPs that UK arms exports to Israel were worth £42m in 2022, representing just 0.02% of Israel's military imports that year. But it would be a major move diplomatically to revoke arms licences for an ally. And it would also be hugely controversial within Sunak's own party, with many Conservative MPs strongly supportive of Israel. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
