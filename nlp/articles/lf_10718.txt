In the last few hours we've been seeing reports of continued bombing and fighting in Gaza, and raids in the West Bank. In southern Gaza, Israel is conducting air strikes on the city of Rafah, according to Palestinian news agency Wafa. In Khan Younis, where hundreds of thousands of Gazans have sought shelter, Israeli tanks have been moving towards the city centre. The AFP has reported that Islamic Jihad fighters blew up a house in Khan Younis where Israeli soldiers were searching for a tunnel shaft. In the last hour the IDF said that several of its soldiers were seriously injured in southern Gaza. Israel has also continued to bombard the northern areas of the enclave, where the military says it has encircled the last Hamas strongholds in Jabaliya and Shejaiya. Palestinian news outlets have also reported raids and arrests across several cities in the West Bank overnight. Footage posted by the Palestinian Information Centre shows Israeli soldiers storming through the Jenin refugee camp in the occupied West Bank. There are also reports of other raids across the West Bank, such as the cities of Silwad and Nablus. At least a dozen people, including a 12-year-old boy, have been arrested in Silwad, Wafa reported. UN and Israeli media reports say the firing of rockets by Palestinian armed groups into Israel have also continued. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
