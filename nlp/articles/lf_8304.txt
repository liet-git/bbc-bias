In northern Israel, a fire has broken out at a winery in the Avivim border community after projectiles were launched from Lebanon, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). There are no reports of casualties and firefighters are at the scene. Hezbollah's Al-Manar TV station cited a statement from the Lebanese armed group as saying its fighters had hit two structures in Avivim "in support of our resilient Palestinian people in Gaza". Separately, the IDF says several projectiles were launched towards one of its aerial control units at a military base in Meron. No injuries or damage to the unit's capabilities were reported. Hezbollah said it had launched several missiles at the base, "achieving direct hits", according to Al-Manar. The IDF says it struck the launch sites in Lebanon. Lebanon's state-run National News Agency reported that Israeli shellfire and air strikes targeted the Fatnoun and Maroun al-Ras areas, which are just over the border from Avivim. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
