Labour MP David Lammy is next in the red seat. Laura asks him about people in Labour calling for government to immediately halt sales of arms to Israel. Lammy starts by acknowledging hostages still in Gaza, six months on from the start of the conflict. Laura continues to push Lammy on halting arms sales to Israel citing some of his Labour colleagues saying enough is enough. She asks if people like the Mayor of London Sadiq Khan and Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar are wrong. Lammy says the only person who can answer questions is the foreign secretary. "He was dodging questions from journalists this week," Lammy says as he reiterated his call for Lord Cameron to come to the House of Commons. Laura previously pointed out the Commons has been in recess for the last week. Lammy calls for Cameron to appear in House of Commons. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
