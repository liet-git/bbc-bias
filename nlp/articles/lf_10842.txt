T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. UN Humanitarian Coordinator Lynn Hastings has condemned the assaults on human rights on both Palestinians and Israelis as the world marked International Human Rights on Sunday. She called for the unconditional release of hostages held by Hamas, while sharply criticising Israel's "disproportionate" response in Gaza. "The air strikes against civilians and civilian infrastructure. . . cannot be justified. Nor can the siege, depriving the entire Gaza population of food, water, health care and hygiene," she wrote in a statement . Israel must allow the delivery of humanitarian aid inside Gaza, she said, reiterating others' calls for a ceasefire. She also noted "unprecedented levels" of Israeli state and settler violence against Palestinians in the West Bank. Sunday marked 75 years since the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was proclaimed, setting out for the first time that fundamental human rights are to be universally protected. "In 2023, I should not have to issue such a statement. It is as if we have learned nothing in the past 75 years," Hastings wrote. UN Humanitarian Coordinator Lynn Hastings. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
