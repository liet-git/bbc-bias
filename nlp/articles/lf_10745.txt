 F-N-S-T-A-R-T. 10745 F-N-E-N-D.  D-A-T-E-S-T-A-R-T. 2024-01-26 D-A-T-E-E-N-D.  T-I-T-L-E-S-T-A-R-T. Court is saying the way Israel conducts the war has to change. T-I-T-L-E-E-N-D.  T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. What the judge has said adds up to a victory for South Africa's lawyers and a defeat for Israel's. She didn't say "you have to have a ceasefire" because under international humanitarian law, under the right circumstances and within the legal framework, the war is legal and Israel was attacked. But what she is saying is the way that Israel conducts the war really has to change radically under these conditions. Israel has consistently said that its fight respects the laws of war. The judgeâ€™s remarks indicate that the court does not agree. I think the Israelis will be outraged by the judgement and the South Africans will be very happy that the case they made will be accepted by the court, and that the case will now proceed.
