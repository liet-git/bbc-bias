More now on the UN secretary general's letter to Security Council members. António Guterres wrote that every civilian in Gaza faced grave danger as “nowhere is safe” and no effective protection of civilians existed as the health care system collapsed and hospitals were turned into battlegrounds. Without shelter or essentials needed to survive, and as Israel continues its constant bombardment, Guterres wrote that he was expecting public order to "completely break down soon, due to the desperate conditions, rendering even limited humanitarian assistance impossible". Guterres concluded his letter by saying that the international community had a responsibility "to use all its influence to prevent further escalation and end this crisis" and renewed his call for a humanitarian ceasefire. Displaced Palestinians, who fled their houses due to Israeli strikes, shelter in a camp in Rafah. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
