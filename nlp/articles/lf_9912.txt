T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. A United Nations representative in Gaza has told the BBC World Service's Newsday programme that residents in Rafah are "terrified" of what's to come. Georgios Petropoulos, the head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, outlined worsening conditions, saying: "Everyone is short of food, clean water, health services, sanitation and even basic room. " He says people are living "six families to one classroom" and that he has seen "a breakdown" in the rule of law in Rafah. The city in the south of Gaza is sheltering an estimated 1.5 million people, many who have been displaced from other parts of The Strip. Petropoulos describes any Israeli plans to push fighting further into Rafah as "concerning" and "terrifying". T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
