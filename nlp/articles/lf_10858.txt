The fear and suffering in Khan Younis is getting greater and greater. Israeli tanks are advancing from two directions. The people are quite worried because theyâ€™ve seen the same situation in Gaza City before the ceasefire. So they believe there will be more suffering. Last night there was heavy fighting around this area, and people could hear bombing and air strikes. There was also some exchange of fire as Hamas says their militants were fighting the Israelis in that location. This morning, the Israeli army issued a warning for the people living in the city centre to leave. They were told to leave west, but the western area has no infrastructure or facilities for people to stay. So most people are staying in tents with very little food and water left in the place, and very little food and water coming from the border of Egypt. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
