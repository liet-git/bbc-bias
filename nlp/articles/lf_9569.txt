A spokesman for the UN children's aid organisation, Unicef, tells the BBC that the seven aid worker deaths clearly show how dangerous the situation in Gaza has become. Speaking to Radio 4's Today programme, James Elder describes the killing of the World Central Kitchen workers as "utterly horrifying" and an "immense tragedy". He adds the deaths "underscores the horrendous conditions everyone continues to endure in Gaza" but it is just such a senseless loss of life". This has been one of the most dangerous places in living memory to operate, Gaza is breaking too many bleak records - numbers of children killed, number of people facing catastrophic hunger, record displacement, worst devastation to homes in living memory and largest number of United Nations colleagues killed since it was created.
