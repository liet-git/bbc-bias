UCLA student Taylor Gee says it looked like police were using "explosive fire sticks" to "strike fear" into protesters earlier today. "It's doesn't seemed like they were hitting anybody, but they're extraordinarily loud and extraordinarily bright and they were using that to basically push all of the supporters for the encampment to a different part of [UCLA's] campus," he says. He says he noticed the police "arrested quite a few students while they were doing it". T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
