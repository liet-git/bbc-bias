This is an unprecedented, direct assault by Iran on the territory of Israel, a key US ally. How the US responds will depend on the scale of the Iranian strikes, the types of weapons used and the extent of casualties and damage. President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu likely discussed a potential response in their phone call just moments ago. The US will want to de-escalate this situation as much as possible and may be forced to reign in the Israelis when calibrating their response. America and Israel will be urged to proceed cautiously and make any retaliation proportional. For the US and its allies, the nightmare scenario is being dragged into a tit-for-tat, escalatory conflict that could trigger a wider regional war. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
