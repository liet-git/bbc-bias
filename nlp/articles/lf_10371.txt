It's just gone 17:00 in London and 19:00 in Israel and Gaza, here's the latest: US President Joe Biden has reiterated "his clear position on Rafah" during a phone call with Benjamin Netanyahu. Washington has repeatedly said it does not support an invasion of Rafah without a plan to help the civilians sheltering there. Streams of Palestinians have begun leaving parts of the southern Gaza city of Rafah - where more than 1.4 million people are currently sheltering - after being warned of a upcoming Israeli military operation in the area. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) says it is "encouraging" people to move towards an expanded "humanitarian area" in Gaza , where "humanitarian aid will continue" According to the IDF, the operation will be carried out with a "limited scope" and is "not a wide-scale evacuation". A senior Hamas official told the Reuters news agency that this was a "dangerous escalation that will have consequences" The long-anticipated move has been the subject of international concern. Israel's defence minister says "military action is required" in the area , after talks with Hamas over the release of Israeli hostages stalled, according to his office. On Sunday, Hamas fired rockets at the Kerem Shalom border crossing , killing four Israeli soldiers. Israeli strikes in Rafah reportedly killed at least 19 people overnight. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
