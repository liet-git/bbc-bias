T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Israel should launch "the mother of all cyber-attacks" and take out Iran's nuclear weapons programme, former US national security adviser John Bolton says. He says one way Israel could deter Iran would be to make it "suffer a cost that would be so disproportionate that they don't even think of attacking again". "Calling on Israel not to respond is reprehensible," he tells the BBC Radio 4's World at One programme, adding that the US and UK would do the same if they faced a similar threat. "The idea of saying 'take the win' simply because the missiles and drones missed their target is like saying 'hey you're still alive, what's the problem'. . . the problem is Israel's under attack," Bolton says. "The next time Israel faces ballistic missiles from Iran, God forbid they may have a nuclear warhead on them. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
