T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. As we've mentioned, the Middle East is likely to be a focal point in today's programme, so let's bring you the latest from the region. Overnight Israel launched airstrikes on several parts of the Gaza Strip as it continues issuing mass evacuation orders to Palestinians. On Saturday flyers were dropped from the air and posts on social media told residents in Rafah's eastern districts to go to al-Mawasi - a narrow coastal area which Israel calls an "expanded humanitarian zone". Israel says it will proceed with planned operations in Rafah despite the US and other allies warning a ground offensive could lead to mass civilian casualties and a humanitarian crisis. The Israeli military says troops have found many tunnels used by terrorists at the Rafah crossing into Egypt. You can read more here about Israel ordering Rafah evacuations. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
