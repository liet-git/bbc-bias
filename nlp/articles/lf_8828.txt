The member from Russia is speaking again, and he says "it would be no exageration to say that today will become one of the darkest days in the Middle East". He blames the US, calling them "heartless" and says the decision to vote against the ceasefire resolution was a "death sentence" to Palestinians. He tells the Security Council "we cannot and must not" leave innocent civilians to the mercy of a "geopolitical game".
