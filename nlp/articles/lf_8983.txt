Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of today’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme. Parliament has been on Easter recess so it’s been a quiet week in Westminster. But there’s been plenty of news elsewhere, and it is likely our guests will be discussing events in eastern Europe, upcoming local elections here in the UK, as well as the Middle East. This week’s political interviews are with the Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden , Labour's shadow foreign secretary David Lammy and we’re also expecting to hear from Nato's chief Jens Stoltenberg. The show kicks off at 09:00 BST , so stick with us here for regular updates, reaction and analysis. Meanwhile, today marks six months since Hamas’s murderous attacks on Israel that has sparked a devastating war in Gaza.
