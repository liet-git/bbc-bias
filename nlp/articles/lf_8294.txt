The UN special expert on the occupied territories has implored the international community to impose an arms embargo and sanctions on Israel, warning she believes the threshold for genocide has been met in Gaza. Francesca Albanese was addressing the UN human rights council in Geneva, one day after the UN security council backed an immediate ceasefire. Albanese, whose report has been rejected by Israel, said there were "reasonable grounds to believe that the threshold indicating the commission of the crime of genocide against Palestinians as a group in Gaza has been met. "Specifically, Israel has committed three acts of genocide with the requisite intent: causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group. " She also accused Israel, in its attacks on hospitals, or its restriction of aid supplies it classes as dual use, of using "the camouflage of humanitarian law to characterize the entire Palestinian population and life-sustaining and life-saving infrastructure of Gaza as targetable, killable and destroyable". In a statement ahead of Albaneseâ€™s speech to the council, Israeli said her report was "an obscene inversion of reality". T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
