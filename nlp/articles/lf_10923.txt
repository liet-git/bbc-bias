 F-N-S-T-A-R-T. 10923 F-N-E-N-D.  D-A-T-E-S-T-A-R-T. 2024-04-07 D-A-T-E-E-N-D.  T-I-T-L-E-S-T-A-R-T. The most destructive conflict in recent history. T-I-T-L-E-E-N-D.  T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. The atrocities of 7 October shocked Israel to its core. Most still back their army’s operations with its stated aim to destroy Hamas. But six months on, this war is described as the deadliest, most destructive conflict in recent history. Israel says it only targets the gunmen who brought terror to Israel. But Gaza now lies in ruin. Hamas has been weakened militarily, but not vanquished. Israel’s staunchest allies, including the US and the UK, are now using their toughest language to call for an immediate ceasefire to protect civilians including aid workers who are also being killed in record numbers. This longest Israel-Gaza war may be reaching a turning point. But Gazans reeling from hunger and overwhelming loss still can’t see a way out. And Israel’s agony over its hostages still held there is an open wound. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
