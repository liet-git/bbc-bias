An Israeli government spokesperson described the situation as a "tragedy" and said initial indications were that the deaths were caused by delivery drivers "ploughing into a surging crowd" of people waiting for aid to be distributed near Gaza City. "At some point the trucks were overwhelmed and the people driving the trucks, which were Gazan civilian drivers, ploughed into the crowds of people, ultimately killing, my understanding is, tens of people," spokesperson Avi Hyman told reporters. "It's obviously a tragedy but we're not sure of the specifics quite yet," he added. The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry is blaming Israeli forces for the deaths, while an Israeli military source also said that they opened fire "at several people" as they thought Israeli soldiers were “endangered”.
