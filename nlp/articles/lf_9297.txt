Israel has approved the building of more than 1,700 new homes in a settlement partly in East Jerusalem, according to media reports. Jerusalem officials gave the go-ahead this week for the neighbourhood, known as the Lower Aqueduct project, the Times of Israel reported. Jerusalem Mayor Moshe Lion has said the project is necessary to expand the supply of housing, but two Israeli NGOs have expressed concern. The Ir Amim organisation, which tracks the construction of Jewish neighbourhoods in East Jerusalem, said an access road to the site would have to be built over Palestinian land. The AFP news agency quoted Hagit Ofran from Peace Now as saying: "If it weren't for the war [between Israel and Hamas], there would be a lot of noise. "It's a highly problematic project for the continuity of a Palestinian state. " Israel considers the entire city of Jerusalem its capital, though this is not recognised by almost all the international community. Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as their future capital of a hoped-for independent state. Israeli construction work in Silwan, East Jerusalem. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
