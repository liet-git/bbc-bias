T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. The United Nations says the new system for inspecting aid for Gaza at the Kerem Shalom crossing is being tested. Earlier this week, Israel said the crossing would be opened - but only for the inspection of aid lorries entering Gaza. Until now, aid trucks have been inspected at Nitzana - 25 miles (40km) south along the Egyptian-Israeli border - before travelling to Gaza via the Rafah crossing. Under the new system, aid will still enter Gaza through the Rafah crossing - but the UN's World Food Programme says relief also needs to enter via Kerem Shalom to alleviate the desperate situation in Gaza. The UN says there's enough food available in Egypt and Jordan to reach one million people in Gaza in a month. Earlier this week, the UN's humanitarian coordinator warned there was "no longer any humanitarian operation worthy of the name in southern Gaza. " Lorries at the Kerem Shalom crossing in 2020.
