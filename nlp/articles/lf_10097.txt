The attack that Iran is mounting on Israel is more extensive than had perhaps been anticipated. But it was inevitable that Tehran would have to ratchet up its response after sustaining what it saw as a violation of its sovereignty with the strike on its diplomatic compound in Syria. That may have been Israel's intention - to force Iran out of its comfort zone of relying on regional proxies to challenge Israeli and US interests in the region. Now, Israel has the ball in its court as to how strongly it will hit back at Iran, which lacks the sophisticated air defence system that Israel has to defend itself. Further escalation will truly take the region into perilous, uncharted territory. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
