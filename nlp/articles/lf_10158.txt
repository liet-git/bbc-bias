Reports emerged on Sunday that dozens of people were killed in Israeli air strikes on a refugee camp in northern Gaza. Footage from Jabalia shows bodies lying in the rubble of a destroyed building - many of them women and children. Asked about the strikes, the Israeli military said it had “acted against a military target” and is “not aware of the number of casualties mentioned”. The Jabalia camp has been hit several times since Israel began its war against Hamas, following the unprecedented attacks on southern Israel which led to 1,200 people being killed and around 240 kidnapped. More than 22,000 people - mostly women and children - have been killed in Gaza by Israeli strikes, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
