As we've been reporting, Israel launched strikes on the city of Rafah overnight, killing dozens. Rafah is in the southern part of Gaza and is located about 30km (nearly 19 miles) south west of Gaza City. It is also the site of the only crossing point between Gaza and Egypt. About 1.5m people are sheltering in Rafah, having been displaced by Israeli operations elsewhere. Many of those people are living in tents with food, water and medical supplies in short supply.
