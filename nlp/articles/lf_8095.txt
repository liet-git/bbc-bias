 F-N-S-T-A-R-T. 8095 F-N-E-N-D.  D-A-T-E-S-T-A-R-T. 2024-02-22 D-A-T-E-E-N-D.  T-I-T-L-E-S-T-A-R-T. Was SNP motion designed to put Labour in tough spot? T-I-T-L-E-E-N-D.  T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. The SNP deny they were playing party politics with such a sensitive issue like yesterday's ceasefire vote. When I spoke to Stephen Flynn, the SNP’s Westminster leader, last night he said they had written the motion to be as simple as possible and had long called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. But Labour sources describe the SNP motion as “one-sided”. These sources point to the fact it did not condemn Hamas, did not recognise the need for Hamas to stop the violence as well as Israel and it included reference to the “collective punishment” of Palestinian people. That is why Labour argued MPs needed a chance to vote for their motion, which called for an “immediate humanitarian ceasefire” but did not make reference to “collective punishment”. It also condemned Hamas, saying “Israel cannot be expected to cease fighting if Hamas continues with violence”. If Labour’s amendment had not been selected, like it was, MPs would have just had a choice between the SNPs call for an “immediate ceasefire” and the government’s language of a “humanitarian pause” - but not yet a ceasefire. Given that choice, many Labour MPs would've been tempted to rebel against their own party and back the SNP. That is why some Conservative and SNP MPs are accusing the Speaker of allowing Labour to avoid a rebellion. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
