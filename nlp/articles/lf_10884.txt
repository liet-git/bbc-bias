Half a year on from the start of the Israel-Gaza war, the death toll in Gaza is rising day by day. In the Israeli military campaign that followed the 7 October Hamas attacks more than 33,000 Palestinians, mainly women and children, have been killed, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. Alma Jaroor, 12, was buried under the rubble of a five-storey building for more than three hours after the building she was in was bombed. Relatives say the building where they were sleeping was brought down by an Israeli air strike. The Israeli army told the BBC in March it could not comment on this claim without co-ordinates for the building. Her entire immediate family were killed by her side - her parents Mohammed, 35, and Naeema, 38; brothers Ghanem, 14, Kinan, 6, and Tarazan, 18 months; and sister Reehab, 11. "We were happy together as a family," Alma told the BBC last month , speaking from Rafah where she was sheltering with her uncle and his family. We used to hug each other when we were scared.
