More now from the interview our colleagues at Radio 4’s The World Tonight have done with Lebanon’s Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib. He says that the country’s Prime Minister Najib Mikati has spoken to Hezbollah to “impress on them to not respond themselves” – although Bou Habib could not guarantee that they wouldn’t. “We are hopeful (tensions) won’t expand more if Israel does not do any more damaging things to Lebanon like this,” he says. Bou Habib says he believes the explosion which killed Hamas deputy leader Saleh al-Arouri was from a drone strike, but says he hasn’t yet received a report from the Lebanese security forces. He also repeated his country’s call for a ceasefire in Gaza. “We want peace in the region, what is happening is so bad, so damaging to everybody,” he says. Israel has not taken responsibility for the attack, but an adviser to the Israeli PM described it as a surgical strike against the Hamas leadership. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
