T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. We've just been getting the latest on the BBC News channel from our reporters in Cairo and Jerusalem. Jo Floto, our Middle East Bureau Chief in Jerusalem, says Israel's special forces are currently combing Rafah in search of what they call "terrorist infrastructure". Israel has already announced that it has found three tunnels, and these tunnels are key to why the IDF wants to be in this area of Gaza, Floto says. Israel has long suspected that this is the entry point for weaponry and other supplies to militant groups like Hamas, he adds. In Cairo, BBC Arabic reporter Abdelbassir Hassan says no officials will confirm whether delegations from Israel or Hamas have arrived for ceasefire negotiations. He says that Egypt, a mediator in these negotiations, is showing restraint in its reaction to the development that Israel is now operating right up against its border between the Gaza Strip. Egypt has condemned Israel's control of the Rafah crossing, as has Qatar, another mediator in these talks. Neither want any enlargement of this conflict.
