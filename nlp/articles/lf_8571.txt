T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. World Central Kitchen (WCK) founder José Andrés has accused Israeli forces in Gaza of targeting his aid workers"systematically, car by car". Monday's strike which killed seven members of his staff was not a mistake, he said, repeating that Israeli forces had been told of their movements. The aid convoy was made up of three vehicles, including two that were armoured, which clearly displayed the charity's logo. All three were hit during the strike. Speaking to Reuters news agency on Wednesday, the Spanish-American celebrity chef said this was not a "bad luck situation where, 'oops,' we dropped the bomb in the wrong place". In a separate interview with Israel's Channel 12 news, Andrés said "it was really a direct attack on clearly marked vehicles whose movements were known by everybody at the IDF". The head of the Israeli military says the strike was a grave mistake that occurred due to misidentification in very complex circumstances. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
