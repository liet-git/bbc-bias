Tensions have flared at the University of Southern California (USC) after it cancelled a student's graduation speech earlier this month. The university said last week that Muslim student Asna Tabassum would no longer be allowed to give a speech as valedictorian due to unspecified security threats. USC cited "substantial risks" to campus security in the decision to halt the address. The move came after accusations that her social media presence was antisemitic. It has angered both those opposed to her speaking and those who want the speech to go on as originally planned. "The university has betrayed me and caved into a campaign of hatred,"  Tabassum told the LA Times at the time. She said she was the target of "a campaign of hate meant to silence my voice".
