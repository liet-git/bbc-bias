A woman accused of supporting Hamas in a speech given at a protest in Brighton has denied the offence at a court hearing. Hanin Barghouthi, of Hove, is charged under the Terrorism Act with a single count of expressing an "opinion or belief" in support of a banned organisation. Hamas is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the UK government. The 22-year-old replied “not guilty your honour” when the charge was put to her during a hearing at Kingston Crown Court. The alleged offence relates to a four-minute speech that was allegedly “supportive of the actions of Hamas”, a previous hearing at Westminster Magistrates’ Court heard. Ms Barghouthi, a student union women’s officer, is accused of making the speech on 8 October, a day after Hamas fighters entered Israel. Judge Peter Lodder KC granted Ms Barghouthi, of Eaton Grove, Hove, conditional bail until her trial begins on 10 June. Under the bail conditions, she is banned from obtaining international travel documents or using a mobile phone not authorised by police unless in an emergency, and she must also live and sleep at her address each night. Judge Lodder said: “If you break your conditions or if you fail to attend court as required you will be committing an offence. ” Follow BBC Sussex on Facebook, external, on X, external, and on Instagram, external.
