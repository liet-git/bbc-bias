Earlier we heard from Dr Ahmed Abuibaid, an ER medic, who fled to Rafah after being displaced by the fighting in Khan Younis. He spoke to me on the phone this morning. "There is no one here who doesn't have a horrible story about themselves and their loved ones," says Dr Abuibaid. "Whether it's the loss of a house, or a member - or more - of their family. " The young doctor includes himself in that group. He says he was forced to give up his job after his family home in Khan Younis was destroyed in an air strike, leaving his father unable to walk. The family were trapped in the rubble of their home, with snipers firing bullets "at anything moving", he recalls. Dr Abuibaid says when they "finally took the risk to leave" a tank fired at and chased them. "Luckily, my family and I survived. " But he says his father needs a scan to assess a traumatic spine injury. He can't be helped in Gaza, and they are not able to leave. He needs to travel as soon as possible - urgently, because every hour he loses his opportunity to walk again. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
