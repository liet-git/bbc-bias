UN aid lorries will be permitted to enter Gaza directly from Israel, starting today, says the Israeli government body responsible for coordinating with the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Posting on social media earlier today, COGAT announced that following security checks, humanitarian aid could be delivered to Gaza via the Kerem Shalom crossing, which borders Israel and the Strip. Reports suggested the first aid trucks drove through the crossing in the early afternoon local time. COGAT said the lifting of the blockade was to "abide by" an agreement with the US to deliver more aid to civilians trapped in middle of the fighting between Israeli forces and Hamas. Up until now, the movement of people and aid in and out of Gaza had been tightly controlled, and only permissible through Egypt's Rafah crossing. The government body added: "This will increase the daily volume of humanitarian aid entering Gaza and being delivered to the people of Gaza. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
