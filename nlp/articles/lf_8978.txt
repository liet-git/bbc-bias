Nato's Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has been speaking to Laura Kuenssberg this week and warns that an "alliance of authoritarian powers " is working more closely together against Western democracies. Stoltenberg says Russia, Iran, China and North Korea are increasingly aligned. Last week he also spoke at a ceremony marking the alliance's 75th anniversary. While the US provided Europe with security, he said it also needed the militaries, intelligence and diplomatic leverage of its European allies. Also on the programme this week is the deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden , who we’re expecting to be quizzed about a wide range of issues that could include growing pressure over UK arms sales to Israel, as well as Russia’s war with Ukraine and upcoming local elections. Labour’s shadow foreign secretary David Lammy will also be speaking to Laura today. He is also likely to be asked about international security and what this year's elections mean for his party.
