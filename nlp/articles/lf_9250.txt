Egyptian authorities are pushing to accelerate the delivery of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip. The chairman of Egypt's information service Diaa Rashwan said that his country would continue its cooperation with its partners to enable faster delivery of aid to Palestinians in the besieged territory, as reported by Egypt's state information service. Egypt controls the Rafah crossing on Gaza's southern border. It coordinates with Israel over when and for how long to open the border, that so far has allowed humanitarian trucks to enter Gaza and some foreigners and injured Palestinians to leave the enclave for medical treatment. Earlier in October, Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry told BBC Newshour that "the Rafah crossing on our side is officially open", but he blamed "aerial bombardments" for making the crossing "inaccessible" and unsafe for aid lorries to cross into Gaza.
