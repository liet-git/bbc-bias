T-I-T-L-E-E-N-D.  T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Some of our contacts in Gaza have been having trouble getting in touch with us today because of disruptions to internet connectivity. Telecom services in the Gaza Strip have been under constant disruption since the beginning of the Israel-Gaza war. Alp Toker, who heads up internet watchdog Netblocks, has told the BBC that this is due to a number of factors, such as fuel shortages. “The significance of these disruptions cannot be overstated, internet connectivity is a lifeline that facilitates emergency services as well as day to day life," he says. He adds that the loss of connectivity could lead to “a rise in misinformation and disinformation”, as legitimate sources struggle to share the reality on the ground. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
