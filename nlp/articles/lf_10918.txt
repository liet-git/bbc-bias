Kibbutz Be’er i is another community devastated on this day six months ago. At least 130 people were killed when Hamas gunmen stormed the farming community, killing women, including and Israeli-Canadian peace activist Vivian Silver , and children. Dozens of homes were also burnt down. As Hamas gunmen began their day-long rampage through the kibbutz, roaming the neighbourhood, shooting residents dead and setting fire to homes, women in the community channelled their horror, disbelief and reassurances through a Whatsapp chat. Hiding in their safe rooms these women - some huddled with their families - described the shouts and explosions they heard outside, told each other where gunmen were, shared tips on coping with smoke that filled their rooms, and repeatedly called for help. In some cases, that help never came. Seven members of Gilad Korngold's family were taken hostage by Hamas . When the BBC’s Lucy Williamson visited what was left of the house from which they were taken, she saw machine-gun fire had gouged holes across the walls, rooms collapsed and gutted by fire, a lacework of the metal doors made by bullets.
