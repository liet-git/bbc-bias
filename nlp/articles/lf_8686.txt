As we've been reporting, Israel's military earlier said it killed four Palestinian militants during an overnight raid in the occupied West Bank town of Azzun. Israel Defense Forces has said that its operations in the West Bank are pre-emptive and aimed at dealing with security threats. It says it has carried out a wide campaign against Hamas and other armed factions in the territory over the past three months. It says that more than 2,550 people have been arrested, approximately 1,300 of whom are associated with Hamas. Hamas is considered to be a terrorist organisation by Israel, the UK, US and other Western powers. Last week, a UN report deplored what it said was a "rapid deterioration" of human rights in the West Bank and urged Israeli authorities to end violence against the Palestinian population there. "The use of military tactics, means and weapons in law enforcement contexts, the use of unnecessary or disproportionate force, and the enforcement of broad, arbitrary and discriminatory movement restrictions that affect Palestinians are extremely troubling," UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said.
