The head of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, is due in Cairo later for talks on a fresh ceasefire in Gaza. Israel has indicated it’s willing to agree to another pause in fighting in exchange for more hostages. Egypt, alongside Qatar, helped broker a week-long truce last month that led to the release of some 100 hostages captured by Hamas in exchange for 240 Palestinians held in Israeli jails. Ismail Haniyeh – who’s usually based in Qatar – is expected to lead the high-level Hamas delegation to Egypt to meet its intelligence chief. Israel’s President, Issac Herzog, has said that his country’s ready for another humanitarian pause “in order to enable the release of hostages". Last night, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, an ally of Hamas, released a new video showing two Israeli men - 79-year-old Gadi Moses and 47-year-old Elad Katzir - who have been held hostage, pleading to return home. International pressure has been mounting for a new pause in fighting that could increase the aid sent to besieged Gaza. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
