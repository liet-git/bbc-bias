The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) says it is "encouraging" people to leave parts of the southern Gaza city of Rafah - where more than 1.4 million people are currently sheltering - as it warns of an upcoming military operation in the area. It has dropped flyers over the eastern part of the city, and phoned and texted citizens advising them to move towards an expanded "humanitarian area" The IDF says the operation will be carried out with a "limited scope" and is "not a wide-scale evacuation" A senior Hamas official has told the Reuters news agency that this is a "dangerous escalation that will have consequences" The evacuation order comes as talks aimed at securing a ceasefire deal in Gaza, and the release of Israeli hostages, have stalled. Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant told his US counterpart yesterday that "military action is required" in Rafah after a lack of progress in these talks, according to his office. Overnight, Israeli strikes in Rafah reportedly killed at least 19 people, while four Israeli soldiers were killed in a Hamas rocket attack near the Kerem Shalom crossing - near one of the main crossings used to deliver aid into Gaza.
