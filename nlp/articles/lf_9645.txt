T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. We're now hearing from some of the residents who have begun returning to Khan Younis in the last 24 hours. As we've been reporting, the southern Gaza city has been under bombardment for months, but on Sunday the Israeli military announced it was reducing its forces in the region, allowing civilians to see what remains of their homes. Najwa Ayyash has told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that when she arrived in the flattened city, she was checking to see if her home was still standing,  “but there is hardly anything left of it", she says. “There are no stairs to get to it. My brother managed to climb up and get us some clothes for my children," she says. Asad Abu Ghalwa tells BBC that he and his neighbour's homes have both been "flattened". “We came to check our house. We didn’t find anything," he says. “I just wanted to find a place to stay with my family. ”. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
