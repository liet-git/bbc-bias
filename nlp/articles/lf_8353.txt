There'll be another attempt at the UN Security Council later today to hold a vote on a resolution calling for a suspension of fighting in Gaza. Tense diplomatic negotiations are taking place over the wording of the resolution to avoid another US veto, with the main sticking point reported to be over the inspection and monitoring of humanitarian aid entering Gaza. The United Arab Emirates, which authored the draft resolution, said yesterday that discussions were continuing at the highest levels. The country's ambassador to the UN, Lana Nusseibeh, said on Wednesday the goal was to have a resolution with impact pass. Asked about whether the US would again veto the resolution, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said they were working to make sure the aid getting in to Gaza wouldn't be complicated by any efforts at the UN. Earlier this month, the majority of the UN Security council supported an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, with 13 of 15 members voting in favour. The US vetoed the demand, and the UK abstained. Israel opposes a permanent ceasefire, insisting it will not end the war until Hamas is dismantled. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
