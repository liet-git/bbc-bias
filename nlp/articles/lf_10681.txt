The UN General Assembly will vote on an immediate ceasefire in Gaza in an hour or so. If favoured, the ceasefire won't be legally binding but will act as a powerful sign of global opinion. It was drafted by 20 Arab countries and the Organisation for Islamic Cooperation. The move comes just days after the US vetoed a similar resolution tabled by the Security Council, but the 193-member General Assembly cannot be vetoed by one country. UN Secretary General Ant√≥nio Guterres has warned of a looming "complete breakdown of public order" in Gaza. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
