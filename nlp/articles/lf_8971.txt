Laura continues to ask Dowden about the government receiving legal advice about Israel in relation to humanitarian law, citing comments from prominent Tory MP Alicia Kearns. "We have concerns which we have raised with Israel," Dowden says as he continues to say he will not publish legal advice as it is based on a precedent set by previous governments. "Israel has engaged with these issues," Dowden adds as he details out the deaths of seven aid workers last Monday and getting more aid into Gaza. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
