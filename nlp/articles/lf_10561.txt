More than 10,000 women have been killed in Gaza since the start of the war, according to a new report by UN Women . The UN agency says that, as the war reached its six-month mark, "it continues to be a war on women". Of the 10,000 women killed, the aid agency says, 6,000 women have left an estimated 19,000 orphan children behind. Those who have survived have been displaced, widowed and face starvation, the report says, adding that more than one million women and girls in Gaza have "almost no food, no access to safe water, latrines, washrooms, or sanitary pads, with disease growing amidst inhumane living conditions". As we reported earlier today, the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza said more than 33,843 Palestinians have been killed since October. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
