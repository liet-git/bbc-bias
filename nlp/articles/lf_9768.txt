As we reported earlier , the chief of the UN's Palestinian aid agency, UNRWA, claimed he was denied entry into Gaza today. Philippe Lazzarini said he was trying to access the enclave to "coordinate & improve the humanitarian response". Israel has yet to respond to the claims. In a post on social media, Lazzarini drew attention to the humanitarian situation in Gaza. "Famine is imminent in the northern Gaza Strip, expected to arrive between now and May," he said. "This man-made starvation under our watch is a stain on our collective humanity. "Children are now dying of dehydration & hunger", he said. Relations between Israel and UNRWA hit rock bottom following allegations levelled by the Israeli government that 13 of the agency's staff placed a direct or indirect role in the 7 October Hamas attacks. A raft of countries withdrew funding for UNWRA following the claims, while the UN has launched an investigation. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
