As a reminder, it's six months to the day since Hamas fighters broke through from Gaza into Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking hundreds hostage on 7 October. In response, Israel vowed to "crush and destroy Hamas" so that it no longer posed any threat, and to bring all the hostages home. Over 33,000 people have been killed during Israel's offensive in Gaza since then. At the Nova music festival, which was taking place near Kibbutz Reâ€™im, 364 young people were killed and 40 taken hostage. In the days following the attack, the BBC pieced together the events at the festival using video, social media posts and facial recognition technology. Footage revealed murder at point blank range, beatings and kidnappings, all being repeated over and over again. It's impossible to know if Hamas fighters knew the festival was taking place at that location - but they would surely have heard the music reverberating across the quiet countryside. We also know that, whether they found the site by accident or not, they came prepared to kill. Gili Yoskovich, who was among hundreds of young people at the festival, told BBC News how the militants "were everywhere with automatic weapons" and how she heard more weapons being unloaded from a van. Relatives of those killed at the Nova music festival on 7 October revisited the site in southern Israel today. Friends and family members marked six months since the attack by Hamas. Memorials have been placed across the site near Kibbutz Re'im. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
