Keir Starmer says escalation is not inevitable, and in repelling the attack, Israel showed "strength and courage". He adds that Israel must now show the same strength and courage to deescalate tensions in the Middle East. "We must proceed calmly, carefully and with restraint," he says. In reference to an earlier strike on Iran's consulate in Syria, to which Tehran says it was responding to with its attack on Israel on Saturday, Starmer says it is a "point of principle" that "diplomatic premises should not be targeted and attacked". But Starmer adds: "Iran's response this weekend was unprecedented, a further step towards the destabilisation of the region. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
