After weeks of ceasefire talks, Hamas said yesterday it accepted the terms offered by Qatari and Egyptian mediators. But Israel rejected the proposal, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying it is "far from Israel's basic requirements". However, he added that Israel would sent negotiators to Cairo today for further ceasefire talks today. A senior Palestinian official familiar with the proposal told the BBC that Hamas had agreed to end "hostile activity forever" if the conditions were met. That phrase hinted that Hamas might be contemplating the end of its armed struggle, although no further details were provided. It would come at the conclusion of a two-phase ceasefire deal, with each phase lasting 42 days. The first phase would include the release of the female Israeli soldiers being held hostage, each in exchange for 50 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails, including some who are serving life sentences. During this period, Israeli troops would remain within Gaza. But within 11 days of the ceasefire coming into force, Israel would begin dismantling its military facilities in the centre of the territory and would withdraw from Salah al-Din Road, which is the main north-south route, and the coastal road. After 11 days, displaced Palestinians would be allowed to return to the north. The second phase would conclude with a "sustainable long period of calm" and the complete lifting of the blockade of Gaza, according to the official. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
