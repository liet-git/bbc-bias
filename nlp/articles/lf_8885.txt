The UN Security Council is set to meet on Friday to vote on whether to call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. The United Arab Emirates has prepared a draft resolution that will be put to a vote on Friday, said news agencies. This comes after Secretary-General Antonio Guterres took the rare move of invoking Article 99 of the UN's charter, which allows the secretary-general to bring to the council's attention "any matter which in his opinion may threaten the maintenance of international peace and security". No one in his role had done this in decades. In a letter to the council on Wednesday, Guterres said the situation in Israel and Gaza “may aggravate existing threats to the maintenance of international peace and security”. This will be the fifth attempt at finding unity among the council's members. Four previous draft resolutions presented since the war broke out were rejected by the council.
