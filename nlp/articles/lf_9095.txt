Today’s ruling is part of a much bigger case brought by South Africa accusing Israel of committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Israel has rejected the claim as false and “grossly distorted”. The ICJ is not expected to deliver a ruling on this case for several years. But at the end of last year South Africa asked the court to take “provisional measures”, which is essentially a court injunction that can freeze a situation to prevent any harm being done before a final court finding is reached. In a highly-charged ruling watched closely around the world, the court delivered an interim judgement on 26 January ordering Israel to take measures to prevent potentially genocidal acts in Gaza. It also ordered Israel to do more to enable the provision of aid to the people there. However the words of that judgement, centred around the use of the word “plausible”, have since been the subject to intense scrutiny, with many interpreting it to mean the court had concluded that the claim that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza was “plausible”. Then last month the then-president of the court, Joan Donoghue, told the BBC that the ICJ did not decide that there was a plausible case for genocide, but rather that the Palestinians had a right to be protected from genocide, as claimed by South Africa.
