Israeli hostages who were kidnapped by Hamas and taken to Gaza were drugged to keep them docile in captivity and some were subjected to sexual abuse, according to a doctor treating some of those who have been released. Renana Eitan, director of the psychiatric division of the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Centre-Ichilov, said "the physical, the sexual, the mental, the psychological abuse of these hostages that came back is just terrible". "I've never seen anything like that" in 20 years of treating trauma victims, she said. "One of the girls was given ketamine for a few weeks," she added. "It's unbelievable to do this to a child. " Children were separated from their families, and one patient told Eitan that several hostages had been held in total darkness for more than four days. "They became psychotic, they had hallucinations," Eitan added. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
