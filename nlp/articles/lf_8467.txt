Robby Chen, Itai Chen's father - a 19-year-old soldier being held by Hamas - has expressed his anger at a lack of communication from Israel's government to the hostage families. He says the last time he met the Israeli war cabinet, it said Israel's ground campaign would bring hostages home alive, but "so far 10 days have passed and all we see are hostages not coming back alive". He holds up an hourglass, which he says he brought to a meeting with the war cabinet. "What are you waiting for? For them to come back in coffins? We demand the government to talk to us today to explain what proposal they have on the table. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
