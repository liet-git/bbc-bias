 F-N-S-T-A-R-T. 8158 F-N-E-N-D.  D-A-T-E-S-T-A-R-T. 2024-02-21 D-A-T-E-E-N-D.  T-I-T-L-E-S-T-A-R-T. Result of Labour amendment expected in a few minutes. T-I-T-L-E-E-N-D.  T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Stephen Flynn, the leader of the Scottish National Party in Westminster, has said his MPs will back the Labour amendment tonight. That means they will sign up to Labour’s wording calling for an “immediate humanitarian ceasefire”. The Labour motion also “condemns the terrorism of Hamas” and notes “that Israel cannot be expected to cease fighting if Hamas continues with violence”. Labour’s motion does not include mention of the “collective punishment of the Palestinian people” which is a technical term amounting to a war crime. The SNP’s support means more MPs will vote for this wording. But remember the Conservatives have a majority in the House of Commons. So unless lots of Conservative MPs rebel and vote for Labour’s wording, it is still likely to fail. These are very approximate timings but we are expecting a vote on the Labour amendment to start at 18:10, with a result around 18:25. Then there will be a second vote on the overall motion, either with the Labour amendment if that passes, or with the original SNP wording if the Labour amendment fails. We are expecting voting for that to start around 18:25, with the result around 18:40. If that overall vote fails, then there will be a the third vote – this time on the government amendment – with voting expected to start around 18:40, and finish around 18:55. These are all best guesses, so bear with us if the timings slip! T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
