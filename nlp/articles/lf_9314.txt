Away from the fighting in southern Gaza, the IDF says it carried out an overnight raid in the Jenin refugee camp in the occupied West Bank, according to Israeli media. The IDF says it located two tunnel shafts and three "bomb-making labs", and it detained 10 "wanted Palestinians". It also says it seized several firearms, weapons, and other equipment. The IDF says troops clashed with Palestinian gunmen in the area, "returning fire at armed suspects and those hurling explosive devices", leaving one IDF soldier lightly hurt. The IDF says another 16 suspects were detained in other parts of the West Bank. Attacks have surged in the West Bank since the start of the war in the Gaza Strip, triggered by Hamas's assault on southern Israel on 7 October, and Jenin has been repeatedly raided by Israel as part of a drive against militants.
