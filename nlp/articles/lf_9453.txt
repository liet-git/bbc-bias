T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller has just held a media briefing where he addressed Israel's killing of the seven World Central Kitchen personnel in Gaza. Here are some of the key points he made: Miller begins by saying the US wants to see a "full, transparent and swift investigation" into the killing of the WCK aid workers. Their killings raise "real concerns" about the safety of aid workers in Gaza. Israel "need[s] to put in place better deconfliction and better coordination measures" to protect humanitarian workers and to protect all civilians on the ground, he says. A proposal to set up a situation room to better co-ordinate humanitarian efforts "is overdue" Ultimately, he says the US will judge the measures that Israel puts into place "by the results, not the intent" Miller closes by saying this will not affect US efforts to create a floating pier off Gaza to bring more aid into the enclave through the sea.
