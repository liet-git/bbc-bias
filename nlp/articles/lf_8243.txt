The SNP's Pete Wishart says that his vote in 2003 against the war in Iraq was "one I'm most proud of". He says today's vote on the party's proposal to call for a ceasefire in Gaza is of "similar significance", and asks the prime minister if he believes MPs should look back on today "with similar pride". Sunak responds by saying that no one wants to see fighting go on "any longer than necessary", adding that the government is doing "everything we can" to bring about a humanitarian pause in fighting which would allow hostages to be released, and humanitarian aid to be brought in.
