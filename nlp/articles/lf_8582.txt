In his statement, Antony Blinken goes on to say that the ICC's move to seek the arrest of Israeli leaders "does nothing to help" the ongoing conflict in Gaza and suggests it could jeopardise ongoing efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement. Blinken accuses the chief prosecutor of rushing to seek the arrest warrants "rather than allowing the Israeli legal system a full an timely opportunity to proceed". "In other situations, the prosecutor deferred to national investigations and worked with states to allow them time to investigate. The prosecutor did not afford the same opportunity to Israel, which has ongoing investigations into allegations against its personnel," he says. "Despite not being a member of the court, Israel was prepared to cooperate with the prosecutor," Blinken continues. "In fact, the prosecutor himself was scheduled to visit Israel as early as next week to discuss the investigation and hear from the Israeli government. " Blinken also questions the "legitimacy and credibility" of the investigation by the ICC prosecutor. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
