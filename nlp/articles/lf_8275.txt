Labour's Lisa Nandy says the party has two main concerns with the SNP motion calling for a ceasefire. She tells BBC Radio 4's Today programme the SNP motion “doesn’t lay out any kind of political horizon to make ceasefire achievable or sustainable". Secondly, Nandy says the SNP motion doesn’t make clear that the term “ceasefire” must be observed by both sides. “Any country would expect the right to defend its own citizens, to rescue its hostages, and we have been absolutely crystal clear in our motion what we mean by it,” she says. When pushed, Nandy won’t say whether Labour MPs will end up abstaining on the vote if their amendment is not chosen. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
