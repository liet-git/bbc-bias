T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. The Human Rights Watch has condemned Tuesday's attack on a Norwegian ship by Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels. The attack caused a fire on board but there were no casualties. The Houthis have vowed to block ships heading towards Israel until Israel stops its offensive on Gaza, in what they say is a show of support for the Palestinians. Intentionally or recklessly targeting civilian vessels is a war crime , HRW said in a statement on Wednesday. “The Houthis are claiming that they’re carrying out attacks on behalf of Palestinians, when the reality is that they’re attacking, arbitrarily detaining, and endangering civilians on ship crews who have zero connection to any known military target,” it said. In November, the Houthis seized the Galaxy Leader, a British-owned and Japanese-operated vehicles carrier registered in the Bahamas. The Galaxy Leader, which was seized by the Houthis on 19 November, is seen here at a port on the Red Sea. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
