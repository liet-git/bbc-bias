The BBC has spoken to the cousins of killed aid worker James Kirby, who they describe as "completely selfless" - the reason which they say he wanted to go to Gaza. Amy Roxburgh-Barry and Adam McGuire say that Gaza was somewhere James was "buzzing" to go to. Adam says: “I’ve spoken to some colleagues of his and he was a professional. He would have the route set up and been in contact with everyone. "He was there to get people from A to B, and it didn’t happen. What happened was unforeseen. ”. Amy says James’ last conversation with his mother, her aunt, was to wish her a happy Easter. “I only knew he was going because the last conversation I had with him, he said he wanted to take his mum on a cruise when he got back," Amy adds. She adds that she's “shocked we can’t finish that conversation and he can’t do that for his mum”. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
