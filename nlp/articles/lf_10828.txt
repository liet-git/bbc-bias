The likely timeline for Israel’s offensive in the Gaza Strip remains a main focus in the Israeli media. As international pressure for a ceasefire has increased, Israeli officials seem to have extended their timeframe. Speaking to Channel 12 TV, the national security advisor, Tzachi Hanegbi, insisted the US – Israel’s closest ally – has set no deadline for Israel to achieve its goals. He said: “The evaluation that this can’t be measured in weeks is correct, and I’m not sure it can be measured in months. ”. Meanwhile, Israeli media analysts widely characterise the current fighting, which involves several army divisions deployed deep inside Gaza, as the second stage of the war. They suggest military officials would like to have until the end of January to complete it. However, it is thought the US is quietly pushing for this phase to end by the new year. Israeli public opinion is also deeply sensitive to emotional calls for a new release deal from the families of hostages held in Gaza. Experts say in the third phase of the war, troops are expected to be deployed in a buffer zone in Gaza for an interim period. The fourth and final stage is supposed to see a new regime taking power, to replace Hamas. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
