Boston's Brandeis University has extended its transfer deadline in the wake of the campus protests. In an open letter, the university president Ronald D Liebowitz wrote: “Jewish students are being targeted and attacked physically and verbally, preventing them from pursuing their studies and activities outside of class, just because they are Jewish or support Israel. ”. He said his college would be "free of harassment and Jew-hatred". One-third of students at the university are Jewish, and it has a deep history with the community. The university said that for those wishing to apply to Brandeis, applications to transfer will be open until 31 May, and it is willing to accept higher numbers than usual. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
