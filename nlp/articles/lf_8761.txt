Video shared across Arabic-language social media shows smoke rising over the Taiba mosque in western Rafah this morning. The mosque is in Tal as Sultan and is more than 4km from al-Awda roundabout - and around 1.5km from the Kuwaiti camp where 46 people were killed in an airstrike on Sunday night. It is also 1.25km from the Indonesian Field Hospital, struck overnight. As with the video of tank tread marks on the road in western Rafah, we can be confident the video is from this morning given the cloudy weather. Using frames from the video to search for other copies, the earliest we have yet seen was posted around 6am BST (8am in Gaza) by the social media account 'Eye On Palestine'. Although there are claims the smoke is from an artillery strike, we are yet to see evidence of what has caused it. Smoke rising over the Taiba mosque, Tal as Sultan, Rafah, morning of 28 May.
