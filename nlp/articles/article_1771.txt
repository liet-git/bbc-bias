Three men are being sought by police in connection with graffiti about the Israel-Gaza conflict which was sprayed on an MP's constituency office.  Shutters at Enfield North MP Feryal Clark's office on Hertford Road were defaced at about 23:05 GMT on 21 November, the Met Police said. It has released images of three men it wants to speak to about the graffiti. In a now-deleted post online, the Labour MP advised those responsible to "next time, just try emailing". It is the second appeal the force has made about the graffiti, having previously released an image of another man wanted in connection with the attack. Ms Clark's post on X, formerly Twitter, had also included a censored image of the vandalism, which appeared to contain the words "free Palestine". The graffiti was painted on the office five days after the MPs voted against a proposal to call for a full ceasefire between Israel and the Hamas-run government in Gaza. Ms Clark, who was shadow minister for health at the time, abstained on the vote, in line with instructions her party gave to its front bench shadow ministers. A number of MPs received backlash after the vote, including a protest by hundreds of people outside Sir Keir Starmer's north London constituency office. Appealing for information about the attack on Ms Clark's office, PC Louis Blackburne-Maze said everyone had "the right to protest and to have their voice heard, but when that crosses the line into criminality, as it clearly did in this incident, we will take action". "Elected representatives have an important role to play and they expect to be held to account, but that should not involve feeling unsafe," he added.
