Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez says Spain is ready to acknowledge a Palestinian state and that such recognition would be a step towards resolving the Middle East conflict. In an address to the Spanish Congress this morning, he says it is "in Europe's geopolitical interests" as he tries to gather support from EU leaders for this acknowledgement. He also describes Israel’s response to Hamas’s October attack as "completely disproportionate”. Sánchez has been one of the most outspoken critics of Israel since it launched its military offensive in response to Hamas' 7 October attacks. His most recent remarks follow those of Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong's , who has suggested the country could recognise Palestinian statehood to increase momentum towards peace.
