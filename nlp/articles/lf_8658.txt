It's just gone 00:30 in Beirut and 22:30 in London, here's a quick recap of today's events: Just      before 16:30 GMT there were initial reports of an explosion at a Hamas      office in Dahiyeh. Hamas      later confirmed its deputy head, Saleh al-Arouri, and two commanders from      its armed wing had been killed in the blast, along with three others. Lebanon's      Prime Minister Najib Mikati condemned the explosion, accusing Israel of      dragging the country “into a new phase of confrontation”. In a media briefing, IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari did not comment on the killing of al-Arouri directly, but did say the Israeli military was on high alert. Hamas called al-Arouri’s killing a “terrorist act”, while Hezbollah said the attack would not go without response. Meanwhile the Israeli military says its troops have killed dozens of Palestinian fighters in Jabalia in the north of Gaza and targeted others in Gaza City. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
