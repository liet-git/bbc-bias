T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Despite fresh calls from the UK and Germany for a ceasefire, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he will continue the war "until absolute victory". In a press conference on Saturday evening he spoke about Israel remaining "relentless" in its military and diplomatic efforts "to bring back all the hostages home safely. " He added that the military pressure is necessary to achieve victory, saying that this strategy had brought back 100 hostages. There have been calls for further negotiations so that the Israeli government can secure a possible hostage deal, with reports that Egypt and Qatar are involved. Netanyahu said: "The assumption of entering negotiations is based on this (military) pressure without this pressure we have nothing. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
