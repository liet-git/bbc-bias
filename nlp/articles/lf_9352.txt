We're hearing more from 12-year-old Malak Al Deirbi , who has just taken a break from selling crisps to eat a meal: Every day, I make my uncle sit at the kiosk and I come to my house to eat with my family. Every day our food is tinned food. Sometimes we can’t get hold of it because my brother is busy getting water and he tries to go to an aid place to find some but by then it’s all gone. This is what the situation is every day with food. Malak (L) eats with her family. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
