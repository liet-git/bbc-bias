The UK's foreign secretary has posted a video on X to acknowledge the six months of the Israel-Gaza war, and reiterates calls for Hamas to release "every one" of the hostages it holds. Lord David Cameron recalls meeting family members of many hostages, and says, "they are showing incredible courage in the most unimaginably difficult circumstances". "It is utterly inhumane to extend their agony," he adds. Earlier, Cameron insisted the UK's support for Israel "is not unconditional", days after an Israeli airstrike killed seven aid workers in Gaza . Writing in the Sunday Times, Cameron said: "We expect such a proud and successful democracy to abide by international humanitarian law, even when challenged. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
