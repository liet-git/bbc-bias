We've been bringing you live updates, reaction and analysis after the International Criminal Court's (ICC) chief prosecutor announced he was seeking arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Hamas's leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar. Let's take stock of what we know so far: ICC prosecutor Karim Khan says he has "reasonable grounds to believe" the men bear responsibility for war crimes and crimes against humanity. Warrants for Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant and Hamas leaders Ismail Haniyeh and Mohammed al-Masri are also being sought by the ICC. The alleged crimes begin "from at least 7 October 2023" in the Hamas leaders' case, while in Israel's leaders' case the alleged crimes begin "from at least 8 October 2023" Reacting to the news, Israeli foreign minister Israel Katz calls the ICC's move a "historical disgrace that will be remembered forever" And senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri says that seeking arrest warrants for the three Hamas leaders "equates the victim with the executioner" The ICC is a permanent global court and it has the power to prosecute individuals and leaders for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. But it has no police force of of its own and relies on national police services to make arrests and seek their transfer to The Hague.
