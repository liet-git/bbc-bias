Dominic Allen, the UN Population Fund's (UNFPA) representative for Palestine says that recent UN-led missions to 10 hospitals in Gaza found many "in ruins", and only a couple still capable of providing maternal health services, according to AFP. He speaks of Al-Khair maternity hospital in Khan Younis, where "it didn't seem as if there was any piece of working medical equipment", adding that the birthing rooms "stand silent". "They should be a place of giving life and they just have an eerie sense of death. " Allen's statement is also carried by UN News , where he is quoted as saying: “What I saw, it breaks my heart…It's indescribable. What we see there is medical equipment, purposefully broken, ultrasounds – which you will know is a very important tool for helping ensure safe births – with cables that have been cut, screens of complex medical equipment like ultrasounds and other with the screens smashed. So, purposeful, wanton destruction in the maternity ward. ”. Dominic Allen. A maternity ward in Khan Younis's Nasser hospital which was destroyed by an artillery shell in December 2023.
