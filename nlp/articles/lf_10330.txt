T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Good morning and welcome back to our live coverage as negotiations over a possible Gaza ceasefire deal are set to continue today in Egypt. Hamas said yesterday that it had accepted truce terms offered by Qatari and Egyptian mediators. But a statement from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office described the proposal as "far from Israel's basic requirements". Israel's war cabinet voted to continue operations but  is however sending a delegation to indirect talks in Cairo. It comes after Israel’s military said on Monday that it had begun telling Palestinians to leave certain areas in eastern Rafah and to head to an  "expanded humanitarian area" ahead of a “limited” operation in the southern Gaza city. Israel carried out strikes on Rafah overnight, and Israeli forces and tanks were seen near the Rafah border crossing in southern Gaza, reports in Israeli media said. The UN, US and others have warned that an assault on the city, where more than a million displaced Palestinians are sheltering, could have catastrophic consequences. Our teams in London and across the Middle East will be bringing you live updates and analysis throughout the day, so stay with us. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
