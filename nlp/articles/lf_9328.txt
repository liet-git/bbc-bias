Israel's foreign minister Eli Cohen has said the residence visa of Lynn Hastings - the United Nations' humanitarian coordinator in the Palestinian territories - will be revoked over what Cohen said was her refusal to speak out against Hamas. Accusing the UN of "bias", Cohen wrote in a post on X, formerly Twitter: "Someone who did not condemn Hamas for the brutal massacre of 1,200 Israelis, for the kidnapping of babies and the elderly and for the horrific acts of abuse and rape, and for using the residents of Gaza as human shields, but instead condemns Israel, a democratic country that protects its citizens, cannot serve in the UN and cannot enter Israel!" Israel has consistently criticised the United Nations for its response to attacks on 7 October carried out by Hamas. Hastings has been a vocal critic of Israelâ€™s offensive in Gaza and has led appeals for increased humanitarian aid in Gaza. On Monday, a statement by Hastings read: "The conditions required to deliver aid to the people of Gaza do not exist. If possible, an even more hellish scenario is about to unfold, one in which humanitarian operations may not be able to respond. " She said a lack of clean drinking water, sanitation and poor nutrition for people is a "textbook formula for epidemics and a public health disaster".
