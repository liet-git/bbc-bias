We are getting reports that Rafah city in southern Gaza has been hit by air strikes. Al Jazeera was broadcasting from Rafah the moment an air strike hit a building in the city and caught it live on camera. Their reporter was positioned a short distance away. The reported bombardment comes one day after another attack in the city , which killed at least 20 people. Rafah is close to Gaza's border with Egypt and many internally displaced Palestinians have moved to the area from the territory's north, where fierce fighting between Hamas and Israeli forces rages on. Quds News Network, a Palestinian news agency, reports that the air strikes were in the vicinity of Rafah's Kuwait hospital. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
