T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Former US assistant secretary of state Mark Kimmitt has been speaking to BBC News about the significance of Isfahan and why Israel might have chosen it as the site of a strike. “Isfahan really is to a great extent the centre of the Iranian nuclear programme in terms of training, research and, what some would say, the development of the Iranian nuclear capability. “So it’s a likely site that Israel would hit because the greatest fear the Israelis have is not continued missiles today but a nuclear capability tomorrow. ”. US officials have told CBS, the BBC's US partner, that an Israeli missile has struck Iran, but the scale of any strike, the exact target, and whether its target was hit remains unclear.
