UK Defence Secretary Grant Shapps, who has been in Israel since Wednesday, has visited Kibbutz Kfar in southern Israel which was attacked by Hamas on 7 October. Saying that a rocket was brought down moments after he went to the kibbutz, he wrote on X: “All a stark reminder that a sustainable two-state solution is needed now more than ever. ”. Earlier he met his Israeli counterpart Yoav Gallant in Tel Aviv. After their meeting Gallant said, “We are determined to win, and we will prevail. ”. Shapps had said that he would use the trip to discuss more aid for Gaza to be delivered faster, including by the sea directly to Gaza. He was in the West Bank earlier this morning and said that the world needed to get more aid to the “innocents” caught up in the war in Gaza. Shapps shared this picture from Kibbutz Kfar.
