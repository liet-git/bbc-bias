Former defence secretary Ben Wallace says Sir Lindsay Hoyle has his "full support" as nearly 60 MPs have now signed a motion of no confidence in the Commons Speaker. "I have served under three speakers. Lindsay Hoyle is head and shoulders above the rest. He is fair, kind and a protector of back benchers. He is not a bully nor a grandstander nor pompous," Wallace, a Tory MP, writes in a post on X . He says the real question is why Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer "seems to think Commons rules should not be followed", asking: "Is it one rule for Starmer and one for the rest of us?" "Labour always knew it was an SNP opposition day so why did Labour seek to override standing orders?" he adds. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
