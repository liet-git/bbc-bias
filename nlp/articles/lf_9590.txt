In Madrid, the Spanish PM, Pedro Sanchez, says Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is "still playing deaf ears. . . he is still bombing hospitals and schools and punishing women and children with hunger and cold". "The two-state solution is in danger of never existing," he adds. "We cannot allow this. We have an obligation to act. In Palestine like in Ukraine without double standards. "We need to send humanitarian aid, and help the refugees we are already doing this. But more needs to be done. " He adds: "This recognition is not against Israel, is not against the Jews. "It is not in favour of Hamas which is something that has been said. This recognition is not against anyone, it is in favour or peace and coexistence. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
