Israel's Foreign Minister Israel Katz issued a strong public criticism of a key member of the Spanish government this morning. In a video posted on social media last week, Yolanda Diaz, Spain's left-wing deputy prime minister and labour minister, used the controversial expression "Palestine will be free from the river to the sea". Writing in Spanish on X, Katz compared Diaz's views with the leaders of Hamas and Iran, saying they called for "the disappearance of the State of Israel and the establishment of a Palestinian Islamic terrorist state from the river to the sea". By not firing her and recognising a Palestinian state, Katz accused the Spanish prime minister of being complicit in inciting "in inciting the murder of the Jewish people and war crimes". Israel has been strongly critical of Spain's decision to recognise Palestinian statehood, which it says will embolden Hamas. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
