At the start of December, Israel carried out intensive air strikes on the city of Khan Younis in southern Gaza, and on 5 December announced that its force had advanced on the area. Since then, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has heavily bombarded central Khan Younis, including a raid on the Nasser hospital in March amid claims it was being used to house Hamas operatives. The district around Nasser hospital was once densely populated - the streets lined with bakeries, home to several mosques and a football stadium. Satellite images from 3 April this year show large swathes of the area now flattened. At the end of November, the Khan Younis Municipal Stadium had a pitch of lush grass, now completely churned up, with much of the stadium itself destroyed. North of the stadium, several rows of buildings have been reduced to rubble. The Nasser hospital to the south of the stadium is still standing, but was left no longer functional following Israeli raids in February. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
