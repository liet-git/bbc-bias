T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. A group of NGOs, including Human Rights Watch, have written to UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron calling for an "immediate halt" in UK arms transfers to Israel. Failure to do so risks the UK government "breaching its own laws and international obligations and being complicit in grave abuses", read the letter dated 8 December and made public on Tuesday . There is a "clear risk" that arms and military equipment supplied to Israel might be used to "commit serious violations of international law, including attacks that may amount to war crimes", the groups said. "Accordingly, the UK Government should immediately suspend both extant licenses for military equipment and technology and the issuing of new licenses," the letter added. The British government has licensed at least Â£472m ($593m) worth of military exports to Israel since May 2015, according to the UK Group, Campaign Against Arms Trade. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
