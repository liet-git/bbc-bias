Noa Argamani, 26, Almog Meir Jan, 22, Andrei Kozlov, 27 and Shlomi Ziv, 41 were freed from two seprate buildings in Nuseirat in what the Israeli military said was a "high-risk, complex" mission in the densely-populated area of Nuseirat. Scores of Palestinians have been killed in Israeli strikes in and around the area of the operation. The al-Aqsa and al-Awda hospitals said they had counted 70 bodies between them, while the Hamas government's media office has put the death toll at 210. The Israeli defence ministry body in charge of civilian policy in the occupied West Bank and Gaza estimate there were under 100 casualties. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called for an emergency UN Security Council session to discuss what he called "the bloody massacre that was carried out by the Israeli forces" World leaders, including US President Joe Biden, France's Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz have welcomed the news of the hostage rescue. Almog Meir Jan is one of the hostages rescued from Gaza. Israeli attacks have killed scores of Palestinians in Gaza. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
