An escalation of the conflict in Gaza to Lebanon, the Red Sea or across the wider region, would add to the extremely high level of danger and insecurity in the world. I’m grateful to the Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati for discussing these crucial issues with me today and for Lebanon’s efforts to prevent such escalation. " Lord Cameron. The stopwatch for a diplomatic solution is running out. If the world and the Lebanese government don't act in order to prevent the firing on Israel's northern residents, and to distance Hezbollah from the border, the IDF will do it. " Benny Gantz. The situation in the occupied West Bank is rapidly deteriorating. Use of military tactics and disproportionate force, and movement restrictions affecting broad numbers of Palestinians is extremely troubling. " Volker Türk. I think our most troubling issue we're dealing with right now is that communities in the central part of Gaza have received evacuation orders from the army in recent days. The reality is more and more people are being pushed down into the south, into Rafah, so more people into a very small strip of land that cannot support them. " Tom White. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
