We've been reporting this morning on Israel's order to civilians in Rafah's east to evacuate the area and move to a new, expanded "humanitarian zone". Much of that new zone, however, has previously been targeted in the conflict, and now lies in ruin. In the map below, we've overlaid the new zone, shaded yellow, with the locations we know damage has occurred. Israel says it needs civilians to evacuate from Rafah to enable it to target Hamas infrastructure in the southern town, which it believes to be the group's last stronghold. As we reporter earlier , Israel has already announced that it's found tunnels in Rafah that it believes are the entry point for weaponry and other supplies for Hamas and other groups. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
