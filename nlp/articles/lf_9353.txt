We’ve just had another update come through from Aseel Mousa , the 26-year-old journalist in Rafah: Before the war at this time, I used to be coming back from work to my home, and then I would relax on my bed and talk to my mum about my day. Now, it is not just boredom. It’s anxiety, tension all the time. Now we will prepare lunch, which will be canned peas, because there is nothing fresh. We only really eat tinned food. We don’t even have snacks. Aseel Mousa. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
