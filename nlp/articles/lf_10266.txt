The British prime minister has said he does not agree with comments made by the Israeli ambassador to the UK after she rejected the idea of a two-state solution once the war in Gaza ends. Asked about the prospect of a two-state solution - which would see the establishment of an independent Palestine alongside Israel - Tzipi Hotovely told Sky News "absolutely no". The idea is supported by the United States and other allies of Israel. In response to Hotovely's comments, Rishi Sunak told reporters "we don't agree with that". "Our longstanding position remains the two-state solution is the right outcome here. "And more immediately, what is going on is incredibly concerning. I've said consistently, far too many innocent people have lost their lives. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
