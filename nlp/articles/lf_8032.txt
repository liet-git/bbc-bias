The chair of the UK Foreign Affairs committee says there are too many restrictions on aid being allowed into Gaza. Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme, Alicia Kearns says she shares the concerns of the foreign secretary David Cameron about British supplies being stuck on Gaza's border. Kearns says on a daily basis, the rules change on what is allowed in, the kind of containers that can be used and how often the border is open. She also claims that a lack of humanitarian visas for aid workers is hampering efforts to distribute the supplies. She says this means having to "resort to a maritime humanitarian corridor, when we all know this is not the most efficient way to deliver aid". Asked about international efforts to secure a ceasefire, Kearns says Hamas must return Israeli hostages for an agreement to move forward. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
