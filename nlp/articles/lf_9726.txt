As we've been reporting, members of the UN Human Rights Council have backed a resolution calling for a weapons ban on Israel, because of its conduct in the war in Gaza. Although a 'Yes' vote was expected, the size of the support for a weapons ban was a surprise. Since the 7 October attacks Israel has had strong backing from Europe, but today that appeared to be ebbing away. Finland, Luxembourg and Belgium all voted for a weapons ban – France abstained, describing the situation in Gaza as utterly catastrophic. While nearly all member states backed Israel’s right to defend itself, there was strong condemnation of its conduct in the war – South Africa said the world could no longer stay silent. Israel’s ambassador described the vote as a dark day for the United Nations – Israel has long viewed the council as biased. But the lack of support at the UN’s top human rights body – just six countries voted no – will increase pressure on Benjamin Netanyahu’s government to change course. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
