Some reaction now from Israel's economy minister to the failed US-drafted UN Security Council resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. Speaking on the BBC News channel, Nir Barkat reminds viewers of the Hamas attack on 7 October, saying that "Hamas's charter is to eliminate Israel off the face of the Earth". Barkat says Israel could stop the war very quickly if Hamas were to "raise their white flag" with a "total surrender". His government is obliged to attack Hamas, he says, adding that nobody can stop Israel from doing that. Barkat goes on to say the Israeli military tries to minimise collateral damage doing "anything we can not to hurt innocent civilians" but insists Hamas uses them as shields. He says Israel "has no quarrel with the civilians in Gaza" but the "reality of war is not simple" and says Israel's troops "will enter Rafah for the reason of dismantling Hamas". He adds: "We recommend the BBC and the rest of the world to ask Hamas where are the hostages?" "We expect the world to put pressure on Hamas, not on us. " Israel's economy minister says Israel has a duty to "eliminate" Hamas. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
