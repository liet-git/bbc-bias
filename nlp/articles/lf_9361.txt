This morning we heard from 12-year-old Malak Al Deirbi , who told us that she helps her family by selling crisps on the side of the street. She is still there this afternoon, and is now sharing memories of her life before the war: We used to eat and drink and we had food. Our dad used to bring us all we needed. He used to go to the market to shop for us and we would play with our cousins. We had childhood days. Now it is all turned upside down. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
