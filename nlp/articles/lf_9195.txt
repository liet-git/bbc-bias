When news broke earlier of a possible Israeli strike against Iran, significant flight diversions started taking place across the country’s airspace, according to monitoring site FlightRadar24. Flydubai also told several news outlets that it would be cancelling all flights to Iran on Friday, and that a flight from Dubai to Tehran had been turned around. Iran is now signalling that the disruption is over and that it’s business as usual at its airports. State news agency IRNA reported that flights have resumed at Tehran’s Imam Khomeini International Airport. Meanwhile, Iran’s civil aviation organisation said restrictions previously put in place across several other airports have been lifted, according to Tasnim, a semi-official news agency. Earlier state-run Mehr TV said that airports in Tehran, Isfahan, Shiraz and across the country’s West, North West and South West, had all been impacted. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
