T-I-T-L-E-E-N-D.  T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. The UN's human rights chief Volker Turk is the latest figure to criticise comments made by two of Israel's far-right ministers, who called for Palestinians to emigrate from Gaza. Turk said he was "very disturbed" by the statements. Earlier, Saudi Arabiaâ€™s foreign ministry called them "extremist remarks" and said it condemned them. At the weekend, finance minister Bezalel Smotrich called for Palestinians to leave Gaza and make way for Israelis who could "make the desert bloom". Then on Monday, national security minister Itamar Ben-Gvir called for "a solution to encourage the emigration of Gaza's residents" and the re-establishment of Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip. The comments have also been criticised by several countries including the US and France, while EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said it was "inflammatory and irresponsible". The official line from the Israeli government is that Gazans will eventually be able to return to their homes, though it has yet to outline how or when this will be possible.
