T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says at least nine people have been killed and several others wounded in strikes on the southern city of Rafah, as Israeli planes and tanks pounded several parts of the territory overnight. The ministry said one strike hit a residential building in the city. It comes after US officials raised concerns with their Israeli counterparts about Israel's plans for military operations in Rafah. The White House said representatives of Israel's prime minister had agreed "to take these concerns into account". The US has repeatedly urged Israel not to launch a major offensive in Rafah to avoid more civilian casualties in Gaza. Meanwhile, airstrikes have also reportedly hit the Al-Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
