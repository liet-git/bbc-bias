Israel's ambassador to the UN has criticised the Security Council resolution, saying it's focus on aid is "unnecessary and disconnected from reality". "Israel is already allowing aid deliveries at the required scale," Ambassador Gilad Erdan said. "The UN should have focused on the humanitarian crisis of the hostages". According to Israeli government statistics cited by Reuters, 129 hostages remain in Gaza, including 22 who are dead. About 240 hostages were taken during the initial Hamas raid into southern Israel on 7 October. In his remarks, Erdan also thanks the US for its support for Israel over the course of several days of negotiations ahead of the resolution, which allows Israel to continue inspecting aid entering Gaza.
