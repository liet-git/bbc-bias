Israel is continuing its bombardment of Gaza, with the main focus on Khan Younis in the south. There's also been fighting in Rafah near the Egyptian border, where thousands of displaced Palestinians have sought refuge. Meanwhile in Jenin, in the occupied West Bank, four people have been killed in what witnesses describe as a drone strike. The Israeli army is still operating in the town, and the BBC has seen armoured bulldozers on the move. International pressure is growing over the humanitarian crisis, and the US has again urged Israel to do more to protect civilians in Gaza. Later, the UN General Assembly is expected to vote on a non-binding resolution calling for a ceasefire. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
