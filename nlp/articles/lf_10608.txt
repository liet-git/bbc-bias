It has just gone 03:30 in Israel and Gaza, and 01:30 here in London. On a live video feed looking towards Gaza we are regularly hearing explosions and the buzzing of aircraft, possibly drones. The Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has said Israel will continue its war in Gaza until it achieves victory against Hamas. His comments come a day after the UN General Assembly adopted a non-binding resolution demanding a ceasefire. Relations between Israel and the UN have reached an all-time low and fighting has continued to rage across Gaza as Israeli forces seek to root out Hamas members. The group's head, Ismail Haniyeh, said he was open to any initiative that could end Israeli aggression but added that there could be no such arrangement that excluded Hamas. The White House national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, has held talks with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman during a visit to Saudi Arabia. Discussions focussed on the Gaza conflict and other regional issues, including efforts to deter Houthi attacks against commercial vessels in the Red Sea. Sullivan will travel to Israel on Thursday for talks with Netanyahu and members of his war cabinet. US officials said he would be calling on the Israelis to be more surgical and precise with their strikes against Hamas targets in Gaza.
