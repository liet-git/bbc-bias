T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Away from the Lebanon border for a moment, and in Gaza the Palestinian Red Crescent charity says its headquarters in Khan Younis has been hit in an Israeli strike, killing one and injuring six others. In unverified footage which the charity shared on X, plumes of smoke can be seen rising from the building as people run away. The organisation also said another strike on a nearby home has caused further damage to the headquarters and to the  al-Amal Hospital. They said it caused "a state of panic and fear". The BBC has approached the Israel Defense Forces for comment. Yesterday, the charity also said five people have been killed and three injured in Israeli bombing on its headquarters. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
