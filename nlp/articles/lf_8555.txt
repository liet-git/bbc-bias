Even before Monday’s fatal missile strikes that killed international aid workers in Gaza, there has been mounting criticism of Israel Defense Forces (IDF) tactics in Gaza from highly experienced and senior retired British Army officers. Commenting on the air strikes on X, formerly Twitter, Maj Gen Charlie Herbert wrote: "They were the result of systemic flaws in IDF rules of engagement". He accuses the IDF of viewing everyone in Gaza as a legitimate target, which it denies. But Gen Herbert, who has served on numerous operational tours in the British Army, says IDF tactics in Gaza are counter-productive from a military perspective as well as being wrong on moral grounds. Other former officers, who have asked not to be named, concur. They say that in the IDF’s pursuit of Hamas, in response to the atrocities committed on 7 October, it has killed so many civilians and wreaked so much destruction on Gaza that it has created an entire generation of future fighters who will now be intent on targeting Israel.
