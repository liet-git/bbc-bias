Huge protests have taken place today in Sana'a, the rebel-held capital of Yemen, in solidarity with people in the Gaza Strip. Sana'a is controlled by the Houthis, an Iranian-backed group that controls a large part of Yemen and which has declared support for Hamas. Since the start of the Israel-Hamas war on 7 October, Houthis have launched drone and rocket attacks against cargo ships in the Red Sea, saying they are targeting those travelling to Israel. This has led to many of the worldâ€™s biggest shipping companies announcing they will avoid the area, and the US launching an international naval operation to protect ships. The protest took place in Sanaa, the Houthi-held capital of Yemen. Some of the demonstrators held aloft a model of the Israeli Galaxy Leader cargo ship, which was hijacked by Houthi rebels last month. The Houthis, who are backed by Iran, have declared support for Hamas in their war with Israel. Protesters also chanted slogans against the new US-led maritime coalition protecting Red Sea ships.
