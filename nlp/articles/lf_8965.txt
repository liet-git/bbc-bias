T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Laura's next question to the shadow foreign secretary is, if Labour wins the general election, would it as a matter of principle always publish legal advice on contentious legal issues, if asked? He says he believes on issues of war a summary of that advice is very important. Pressed again, Lammy says he canâ€™t foresee every circumstance for the next decade or so, but he believes on this issue - where there is so much discussion and debate - a summary of the advice should be published.
