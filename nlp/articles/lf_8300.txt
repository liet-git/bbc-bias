The UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) has called on Israel to revoke its decision to bar the group from delivering aid to northern Gaza. It comes two days after UNRWA said it had been told that Israel would no longer approve any of its aid convoys to the north, where many people are reported to be on the brink of starvation. The agency is currently being investigated after Israel accused at least 12 of its staff of involvement in the 7 October attacks. Its head, Philippe Lazzarini, has told the Reuters news agency that it has enough funds to last until May, after several countries paused their contributions in the wake of the allegations. Lazzarini added that he was "hopeful" donors would come back, after some countries recently announced they would resume funding. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
