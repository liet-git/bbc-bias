T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. I have just heard from the director of Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, Nahed Abu Taima. He told me: "We lost control in the face of the large number of injured people arriving at the hospital. "Hundreds of wounded and martyrs arrive at the emergency department. "With the continued Israeli bombing of several areas in Khan Younis, we are forced to treat the injured on the ground and in the corridors of the departments in light of the lack of medical supplies.
