After Hamas’s assault on Israel on 7 October, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country's aims in Gaza were the destruction of Hamas and the return of the hostages. Some 253 hostages are thought to have been taken to Gaza from Israel last October and Hamas was thought to have about 30,000 fighters in Gaza. In a recent statement, the IDF said it had killed about 13,000 Hamas fighters since the start of the war, although it did not say how it calculated that figure. Hamas is an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries. Since Israel launched its ground offensive in Gaza in an attempt to achieve its stated aims, at least 33,000 people have been killed, and tens of thousands injured by Israeli strikes, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry , most of whom it said were women and children. There’s been only one temporary ceasefire, at the end of November, during which over 100 hostages were released, but talks mediated by the US, Qatar and Egypt have failed to bring about a permanent solution. Israel wants a temporary pause in fighting and has said it will not end the war until Hamas is annihilated. Hamas is sticking to its demands of "a permanent ceasefire that would lead to a full withdrawal" of Israeli forces from Gaza and the return of displaced Palestinians to their homes. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
