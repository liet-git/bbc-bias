As we've been reporting, the UN is expected to vote later today on its latest draft resolution on humanitarian aid for Gaza. Sam Bloch, director of emergency response at the charity World Central Kitchen, has been speaking to the BBC about food in Gaza being in "short demand". He says: "We have seen a incredible condensing of the population. The whole southern part of Gaza usually has around 280,000 people and we now have well over a million. "We are feeding as many as we can and currently providing enough food for one meal a day - but that is not even close to enough. We are doing all that it is that we can. "We have had around 400 trucks enter Gaza and we have a lot waiting on the Egyptian side waiting to come in. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
