As we've been reporting, the Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings - the key entry points for aid into Gaza - remain shut , cutting off aid deliveries into the Gaza Strip, the UN says. A spokesperson for the United Nations' humanitarian office, Jens Laerke, says both crossings fall within the evacuation zone, which means "the two main arteries for getting aid into Gaza are currently choked off". Israeli officials told the UN that there will be no crossings of personnel or goods in or out of the Rafah crossing "for the time being", Laerke says. Kerem Shalom crossing was closed after a rocket attack by Hamas fighters over the weekend killed four Israeli soldiers in the area. Hamas then targeted the crossing in another attack on Tuesday morning. Laerke adds that there is just one day of fuel left to sustain the UN's entire operation in Gaza. He also criticises Israel's evacuation notice, saying there was not enough warning to civilians and the UN was not informed before it warned Palestinians to evacuate eastern parts of Rafah ahead of the strikes. He adds there is no safe passage to the new humanitarian zone, and says that those on the ground have told him of "massive bombs lying in the street" in Khan Younis. Jens Laerke addressed a press conference in Geneva earlier today. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
