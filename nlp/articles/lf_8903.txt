Russia has again criticised the draft resolution, accusing the US of playing an “underhanded game” by not doing more to restrain Israeli operations in Gaza. Ambassador Vasily Alekseyevich Nebenzya said that the resolution is, in Russia’s view, a “licence for Israel to kill Palestinian civilians in Gaza. ”. “This is a tragic moment for the council…one of unprincipled blackmail,” he added. Nebenzya said Russia would have vetoed the resolution if it “weren’t supported by a number of Arab states. ”. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
