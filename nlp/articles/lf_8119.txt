T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Meanwhile, the Association of Rape Crisis Centers in Israel has gathered evidence that Hamas gunmen "systematically and intentionally" committed sexual crimes during the 7 October attacks on Israel. A report by the umbrella organisation describes "identical patterns" of sexual violence at multiple locations. These allegedly included violent rapes of women conducted "collectively" or "in front of an audience". On 7 October, hundreds from the Palestinian armed group infiltrated southern Israel, where they killed about 1,200 people and took 253 others hostage. Israel responded by launching a military campaign in Gaza, during which 29,300 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. You can read more about the report here .
