Footage that we have verified shows the aftermath of the claimed Israeli assault on Nasser hospital in Khan Younis. In one video, a patient – who is still in their bed – is moved through a smoke- or dust-filled corridor where the ceiling is damaged. Other patients can also be seen, including one person being carried away in what looks like a blanket. We have verified the footage by identifying the hospital’s distinctive tilework as well as various signs. Some of the videos have come from doctors working in the hospital. Recent social media posts show them in clearly recognisable areas of the hospital complex. By observing timestamps of the material and searching for previous versions cached online, we know these videos only appeared online recently. On 14 February we also verified a number of videos showing civilians being urged to leave the hospital by the IDF and departing the area. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
