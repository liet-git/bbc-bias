T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. The UN's nuclear watchdog chief yesterday expressed concern about possible Israeli targeting of Iranian nuclear facilities. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) director general Rafael Grossi said Iran closed its nuclear facilities on Sunday over "security considerations", and that while the facilities reopened on Monday, IAEA inspectors were being kept away "until we see that the situation is completely calm". "We are going to resume tomorrow," Grossi told reporters after a UN Security Council meeting. When asked about the possibility of an Israel strike on Iranian nuclear facilities, Grossi said: "We are always concerned about this possibility. " Olli Heinonen, former deputy director general for safeguards at the IAEA, tells BBC Radio 5 Live that Iran doesn't have full cooperation with the agency yet, meaning its operations are limited. "There is always the question of ‘what if they [Iran] have more nuclear material somewhere hidden? What if they have some additional facilities that they have not disclosed to the IAEA?’ There is no remote monitoring. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
