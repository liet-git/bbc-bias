We are now hearing from Anum Qaisar, SNP. She begins by reiterating that Jewish people have friends in the chamber and says that "Jewish people are not the Israeli government and Muslims are not Hamas". She continues to say that "Gaza is under siege from the air," she says, and mentions the F35 bomber and other weapons being made in British factories. "We simply do not know if those weapons are being used by Israeli authorities in the massacre of families and children in Gaza," Qaisar says. She adds that politics is all about choices and that the UK government has the choice to suspend arms exports to Israel. She adds that it "sickens me to my core that the UK continues to sell arms to Israel". T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
