Hamas has put Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, under pressure. His first public response to the group's agreement to a ceasefire was to say it was "far from meeting Israel's demands". Nonetheless, he has dispatched a delegation to discuss it. He is in a political bind. His government depends on the support of Jewish ultranationalists.
