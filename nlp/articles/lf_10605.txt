 F-N-S-T-A-R-T. 10605 F-N-E-N-D.  D-A-T-E-S-T-A-R-T. 2023-12-14 D-A-T-E-E-N-D.  T-I-T-L-E-S-T-A-R-T. Explosion after explosion. T-I-T-L-E-E-N-D.  T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. It's just gone 07:15 in Israel and Gaza, and 05:15 here in London, and through a live video stream we can hear explosion after explosion reverberating from the direction of the Palestinian territory as aircraft pass. Filmed at a distance from over the boundary inside Israel, the stream shows only a fairly clear morning sky with a few clouds. At least that may bring some relief to thousands of homeless Gazans struggling with winter rain this week as they shelter in tents. Displaced Palestinians in Rafah on Wednesday. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
