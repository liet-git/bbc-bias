The UN agency which supports Palestinian refugees has insisted it has a "scrutiny and screening process for all its staff" and that it shares employee lists with the host governments of the countries it works in. Juliette Touma, UNRWA's director of communications, gave a statement to the BBC in response to claims made by Mark Regev, a senior adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Regev was discussing footage - verified by the BBC - which showed a group of men in Gaza stripped to their underwear , kneeling on the ground and being guarded by Israeli soldiers. He said it was possible that some of the men shown were UN workers - but that did not "automatically" mean they were not also Hamas members. Touma also said UNRWA shared with Israel its staff lists for Gaza and the occupied West Bank - adding that even though the lists were sent once a year, the agency has never received a response.
