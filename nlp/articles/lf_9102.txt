UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron has warned Israel it must allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza to avoid starvation and large outbreaks of disease. Speaking while visiting Kosovo, Cameron said he was worried about people getting ill and going hungry, adding: Israel has a right to combat Hamas and to stop a 7 October event happening again - it was an appalling slaughter, an appalling event - and we support them as they do that. But we must have more aid in Gaza to stop starvation, to stop disease. ‚Äù. He also touched on the current situation in the Red Sea, where Houthi rebels from Yemen - who've declared support for Hamas - have been attacking commercial shipping. Earlier, in a joint statement, the US, UK and 10 other states warned the Houthis they'd face consequences if they continued. When asked, Cameron declined to specify what action Britain would take. "This is illegal. It's not to do with Gaza, it's not to do with Israel. This is about the freedom of navigation. This is about the ability of ships to carry their cargo. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
