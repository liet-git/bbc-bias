T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Blinken is once again pressed on the recent events in Iran. It is put to him that the Israeli and Iranian responses seem measured and calculated and is asked if that means a major confrontation has been averted. He's also asked about the US position on Rafah. Blinken repeats that his focus is on de-escalation and calling on all sides concerned to show restraint. On Rafah he says the US cannot support a major military operation there. He says there are around 1.4m people in Rafah and they must be able to get out of the way of any conflict and that's a "monumental task". He says a major military operation there would have "terrible consequences". Blinken also criticises Hamas' leadership of the people in Gaza. Displaced Palestinians shelter in a tent camp in Rafah.
