This is one of those defining moments for the Security Council. To push them to demand an immediate ceasefire, the secretary general has invoked for the first time in his tenure a rarely used power granted to UN chiefs by the organisation’s charter. Antonio Guterres will address council diplomats today in an open meeting after speaking with many leaders over the phone, including the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, the UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron and several Arab ministers. Arab and Islamic nations immediately responded to his letter with a draft resolution that will be voted on today. The majority of the council has long supported an immediate ceasefire so all eyes will be on Israel’s ally, the United States. While they have not publicly stated whether they intend to exercise their veto again, they have signaled as much. The US’s position is that a resolution would not be “useful at this time”. If the council is once again blocked from taking action from a permanent veto wielding member, it will raise the question, not for the first or last time, if the Security Council is fit for purpose.
