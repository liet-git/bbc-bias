 F-N-S-T-A-R-T. 8118 F-N-E-N-D.  D-A-T-E-S-T-A-R-T. 2024-02-21 D-A-T-E-E-N-D.  T-I-T-L-E-S-T-A-R-T. In summary... what happened today in the Commons. T-I-T-L-E-E-N-D.  T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. We are preparing to close this live page, so let's try to unpick what happened today, and what it actually means. What's the one clear takeaway? Labour's call for an "immediate humanitarian ceasefire" in Gaza was approved. What was supposed to happen today? It was opposition day, when opposition parties can set the agenda in the Commons. It was the Scottish National Party's turn today, and they wanted the Commons to vote to demand an "immediate ceasefire" in Gaza. The governing Conservatives put through an amendment, and so did Labour. Opposition parties very, very rarely get to amend other opposition parties' propositions. So why all the chaos? Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle accepted both - breaking with established precedent and sending the House into meltdown. Tory and SNP MPs walked out. That left only the Labour amendment standing. Hoyle apologised, but several MPs called for his resignation. What, ultimately, does the proposition passed today mean? It does add to calls for a ceasefire in Gaza, but ultimately neither Hamas nor Israel will pay it any attention. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
