Crowds have gathered in Tel Aviv in what is now known as Hostages Square, one of the symbols of the families’ agonising wait for those who are still captive in Gaza. Relatives are extremely angry, reacting to the deaths of three Israeli hostages who were shot dead by mistake by Israeli soldiers. The relatives always knew that the resumption of hostilities meant that the lives of the hostages were at risk. But details of how the captives were killed - as they left a building carrying a makeshift white flag - have shocked people here, and across the country. There is growing pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to try to reach a new deal with Hamas for the release of at least some of the hostages. More than 120 people remain in captivity. “We don’t need dead bodies. We need people alive,” Naama Weinberg, whose cousin Itai remains in captivity, told me, as she raised concerns about the safety of the remaining hostages. The families say the only way to bring back their loved ones is by reaching a new deal. Until now, the authorities have said that could only be achieved by putting military pressure on Hamas.
