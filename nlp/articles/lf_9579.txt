But it also says it's summoning the ambassadors in Israel of Ireland, Spain and Norway to a "reprimanding conversation" - during which they will watch the video of the kidnapping of female Israeli soldiers on 7 October. Israeli foreign minister Israel Katz says: "History will remember that Spain, Norway and Ireland decided to award a gold medal to the Hamas murderers and rapists, who raped teenage girls and burned babies. "I ordered the ambassadors to be immediately summoned for reprimand talks - during which they will watch the horrifying kidnapping video of the abduction of the female observers to illustrate to them what a twisted decision their governments made. "Israel will not go over this in silence - their step will have serious consequences.
