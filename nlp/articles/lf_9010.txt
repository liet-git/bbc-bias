T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. A former British Army colonel describes the fire directed at Israel from the border with Lebanon as “intense”. Speaking to BBC News, Colonel Richard Kemp - who is also a trustee of UK Friends of the Association for the Wellbeing of Israel’s Soldiers - says: “It’s a problem with an estimated 150,000 rockets pointing at Israel by Hezbollah in Lebanon, and tens of thousands of highly trained fighters who fought on the side of Assad in Syria in some cases. “They are going to have to be dealt with at some point. This is basically a bit like Hamas in Gaza, it’s a gun to Israel's head. ”. Kemp adds that diplomatic efforts by the US and France were ongoing to try to avoid a major conflict in the area. Cross-border exchanges of fire have been escalating since Hamas's 7 October attacks on Israel. At least four civilians and nine soldiers are known to have been killed on the Israeli side of the border since October. More than 100 people have been killed in Lebanon, most of them Hezbollah fighters but civilians, including three journalists have also been killed. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
