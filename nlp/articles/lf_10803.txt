T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has said that Israel had no intention of staying permanently in the Gaza Strip and that it was open to discuss alternatives about who would control the territory, as long as it was not a group hostile to Israel. Gallant said hundreds of Hamas operatives in Gaza have surrendered or been arrested in recent days, including people who participated in the 7 October attacks. “We have encircled the last strongholds of Hamas in Jabaliya and Shejaiya, the battalions that were considered invincible, that prepared for years to fight us, are on the verge of being dismantled,” the Times of Israel quoted him as saying. "Those who surrender will be treated in one way, and those who do not surrender will be treated in another way," he added.
