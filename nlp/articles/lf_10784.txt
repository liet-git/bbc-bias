 F-N-S-T-A-R-T. 10784 F-N-E-N-D.  D-A-T-E-S-T-A-R-T. 2024-01-26 D-A-T-E-E-N-D.  T-I-T-L-E-S-T-A-R-T. What about the allegation of genocide? T-I-T-L-E-E-N-D.  T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Today's ruling is not about whether Israel has breached the Genocide Convention â€“ that will come much later. The genocide convention (1948) defines genocide as the "intent to destroy in whole or part, a religious, ethnic, national or racial group". At the heart of genocide allegations is the issue of intent. During the oral proceedings, South Africa and Israel provided a different interpretation of event, based on their interpretation of the underlying intent. Israel said it was moving civilians out of harm's way. South Africa argued those orders constituted forced displacement. It's not about the level or extent of violence, it's about intent - intent is the crucial element in the fundamental part, or "merits", of this case. Both sides will have an opportunity to present arguments before a ruling on the broader accusation - the evidentiary standard to meet genocidal intent has a much higher threshold than those required for provisional measures to be granted.
