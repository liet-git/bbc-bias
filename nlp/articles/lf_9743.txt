Members of the UN Human Rights Council have backed a resolution calling for a weapons ban on Israel, because of its conduct in the war in Gaza. Twenty-eight countries voted in favour, six against, and 13 abstained. Ahead of the vote cracks appeared between European countries, with Germany and Bulgaria saying they would vote against because the resolution did not explicitly condemn Hamas (although it did condemn the firing of rockets into Israel from Gaza, and call for the release of hostages). France abstained, describing the humanitarian situation in Gaza as "catastrophic". The vote, while not binding, does come from the UNâ€™s top human rights body, and will increase the diplomatic pressure on Israel to change course. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
