T-I-T-L-E-E-N-D.  T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Israel’s chief military spokesman, Daniel Hagari has issued a lengthy video statement on this morning’s aid convoy incident. It differs from the account given earlier by other IDF spokesmen. Rear Admiral Hagari said IDF had “coordinated” a convoy of 38 trucks, with Egyptian aid, being distributed by “private contractors”. He said thousands of Gazans had descended on the trucks. “Some began violently pushing and even trampling other Gazans to death, looting the humanitarian supplies”. He said the first truck started making its way through Israel’s humanitarian corridor at 04:40. Tanks were on the scene “to secure the humanitarian corridor for the aid convoy”. UAVs were in the air “to give our forces a clear picture from above”. At 04:45, he said a mob ambushed the trucks, bringing them to a halt. He said tanks tried “cautiously” to disperse the crowd with “a few warning shots”. “When the hundreds became thousands and things got out of hand, the tank commander decided to retreat to avoid harm to the thousands of Gazans that were there,” he said, adding that tanks did not fire on the convoy. In a separate Hebrew language statement, he said that the tanks had opened fire on people who appeared to present a threat. Interestingly, Hagari revealed that the IDF had been conducting humanitarian operation of this kind for the last 4 nights without any problem (until today). On Monday, Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said the IDF had submitted a plan to provide humanitarian assistance to the Gaza Strip “in a manner that would prevent the looting that had occurred in the northern Strip and other areas”.
