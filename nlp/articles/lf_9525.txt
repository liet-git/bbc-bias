Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant has announced he will establish a "professional investigation team" after an airstrike killed seven aid workers in Gaza, an incident that Israel earlier described as "unintentional". Gallant posted on the social media platform X that the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) will open a "joint situation room" with international aid agencies so they can coordinate on the ground. He says Israel was "committed" to working with international partners to facilitate the distribution of aid and that it would allocate resources to that end. Gallant goes on to describe the incident as "tragic" and adds that it "will be investigated thoroughly". The IDF, he says, will update aid agencies on the action it was taking. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
