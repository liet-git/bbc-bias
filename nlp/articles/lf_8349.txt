As we mentioned earlier, Israel's military says it has discovered a new network of tunnels in the heart of Gaza City that are connected to the homes of Hamas's senior leaders. Hamas hasn't commented on the Israel Defense Forces claims, but here are the main things we know about the tunnels underneath Gaza: The tunnels are thought to cover around 300 miles (500 kilometres) under Gaza. They are believed to be up to 260 feet (80 metres) below the surface and have entrances located on the bottom floors of houses and public buildings. Israel's forces say the tunnels are used as hide-outs for Hamas to plan operations against Israel. It is possible a cross-border tunnel was used by Hamas during the 7 October attacks. They were originally a way of smuggling goods across borders with Israel and Egypt. Construction began before Israel withdrew its troops and settlers in 2005.
