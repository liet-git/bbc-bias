"If you want a real ceasefire, here is the right address - this is the phone number of Hamas’s office in Gaza," Gilad Erdan said, holding up a poster with a telephone number and the face of the group's leader in Gaza. “What would your countries do if you were in Israel’s shoes? Call for a ceasefire? What would Moscow do? Beijing? Istanbul? How would you respond? Everyone here knows exactly," Erdan asked. "Tell Hamas to put down their arms, turn themselves in, and return our hostages. This will bring a complete ceasefire that will last forever! So, why are you not doing this? Why are you not holding Hamas accountable?”. And he added: "A ceasefire only serves to prolong Hamas's reign of terror so I urge all member states to vote against this resolution. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
