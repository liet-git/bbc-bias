Israel must ensure that any military units which may be directed, supported or influenced by it, as well as any organisations and people which it controls or influences, take no steps to further military operations in Gaza. South Africa and Israel will prevent genocide against Palestinians. Israel must desist from killing, injuring, destroying life and preventing births in relation to Palestinians. Israel must prevent displacement, deprivation - including of food, water, shelter, aid and medical supplies - and the destruction of life of Palestinian people. Israel must not incite genocide, and must punish acts of and encouragement to genocide. Israel must prevent the destruction of and ensure the preservation of evidence and not deny access by fact-finding missions, international mandates and other bodies to Gaza.
