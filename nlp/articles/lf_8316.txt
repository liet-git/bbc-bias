Talks between Israel and Hamas are continuing via mediators in Qatar, after yesterday's UN Security Council vote calling for an immediate ceasefire and the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza. Following the vote, Hamas said it had told mediators it was sticking to its original demands for a comprehensive ceasefire which include the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and a return of displaced Palestinians - something the Israeli prime minister’s office described as “unrealistic. ”. Reports suggest that a deal being worked on at the time of the vote proposed 40 Israeli hostages would be released in exchange for 800 Palestinian prisoners. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
