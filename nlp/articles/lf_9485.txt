The founder of World Central Kitchen José Andrés has called on Israel to "let people eat", after an Israeli air strike killed seven of the charity's workers in Gaza. In an op-ed for the New York Times , Andrés says Israel "is better than the way this war is being waged". "It is better than blocking food and medicine to civilians. It is better than killing aid workers who had coordinated their movements with the Israel Defense Forces," he says. The charity head also disputes Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's claim that something like this "happens in war", saying Monday's strike "was a direct attack on clearly marked vehicles whose movements were known" by the military. "It was also the direct result of a policy that squeezed humanitarian aid to desperate levels," he says, calling on the government to open more routes for the delivery of food and medicine to Gaza. Andrés also pays tribute to the seven workers killed, calling them the "best of humanity". T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
