If you're just joining us this afternoon for our Israel-Gaza conflict coverage, or need a recap, let's bring you up to date with the key developments today: Israel's army has issued another call for Palestinians to evacuate Gaza City in the north and Khan Younis in the south as it says it is closing in on "full control" of northern Gaza. PM Benjamin Netanyahu says dozens of Hamas militants have surrendered and he described the situation as “the beginning of the end” for the group. Palestinian health officials say dozens of people have been killed in the past 24 hours as the Israeli military has bombed targets in Gaza City in the north, and the southern cities of Rafah and Khan Younis. Seven more Israeli soldiers have been announced killed this morning, bringing the total number to 104. Rockets have again been launched from Gaza into Israel , with one person injured in the central city of Holon. The UN's Palestinian refugee adency says there is "almost a total breakdown of civil order" around its aid deliveries. The UN general assembly will meet on Tuesday and is likely to vote on a draft resolution demanding an immediate humanitarian ceasefire - after the US vetoed an earlier UN security council resolution last week.
