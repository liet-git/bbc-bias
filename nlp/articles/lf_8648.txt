Let's get some more analysis now on the death of Saleh al-Arouri, the senior Hamas official who was killed in a strike on Lebanon's capital Beirut yesterday. A retired colonel from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) tells the BBC that al-Arouri was "living in the heart of the Dahiya, in the heart of the Hezbollah area of Beirut" and he was the "direct connection between Hamas and Hezbollah ". "As such, it is a very important event that has taken place inside the Middle East," Miri Eisin explains. On whether the strike - which Israel has so far not claimed responsibility for - risked a full-blown conflict with Lebanon, Eisin says she feels "very bad for the Lebanese [people]" but that "we're talking about terror operatives" when discussing Hezbollah. "Hamas have been firing from Lebanon into Israel," she says, adding: If you don't act, you're giving them free rein. If you do act, you need to be aware that they may respond . . . I don't think it's about winning. I think it's about making sure that terrorism does not win. " Miri Eisin tells the BBC Israel has to weigh up the risk of retaliating against Lebanon - where "Hamas have been firing from" T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
