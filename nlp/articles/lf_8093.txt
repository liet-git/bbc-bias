The heads of some of the UK's largest charities are calling out the country's politicians for "political theatrics". Oxfam’s Head of Policy and Advocacy, Katy Chakrabortty , accused MPs of dithering in "playground politics" and added that: “The people of Gaza can’t wait for our politicians to stop squabbling. ”. The CEO of ActionAid UK, Halima Begum, says that the international charity is "extremely disappointed to see the utter paralysis in parliament this evening". "A great disservice has been done to the British people, who expected their political parties and elected representatives to conduct a meaningful debate concerning an issue on which depends the lives of over a hundred Israeli hostages, and hundreds of thousands of Gazans suffering one of the most acute humanitarian crises we have seen in recent times. " Halima Begum. Those attitudes were shared by Helen McEachern , head of CARE International UK, who says that the charity was "dismayed by the political theatrics” that ultimately “do nothing to assist the people of Gaza".
