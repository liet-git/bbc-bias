Like others we’ve been speaking to throughout the day, Rewaa, who is living in Deir al Balah in Central Gaza, has been eating her second and final meal of the day. “This meal cost us more than $40 (£31)," says Rewaa over WhatsApp while sharing a video of her lunch of chicken, olives and peppers. “We don’t have different types of food. We are blessed that we can afford two meals. Some people can’t afford any. ”. She says the other major problem is nappies, which can cost $80 (£63) for a pack of 43. Rewaa is a mother to two young children, one is less than 5 months old. “I had to put toilet paper in the diaper for the day and change it once,” she writes. Her oldest daughter, who is just two years old, is wearing the same clothes she was in last year,  which she describes as “short but fine”. "There are no clothes and if we can find any, it costs a lot of money. ”. This meal for Rewaa's family cost her $40 (£31) T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
