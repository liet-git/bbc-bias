The World Food Programme (WFP) says that more than one in four households in Gaza faces extreme hunger and that there is a risk of famine unless access to food, clean water, health and sanitation services are restored. The latest analysis from Gaza, which includes data from the WFP and other UN agencies, states that the territory's entire population are in crisis levels of food insecurity, or worse. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) - which undertook the report - says there's a risk of famine within the next six months if this conflict persists. The WFP goes on to say the recent temporary ceasefire between Israel and Hamas showed that aid could be provided when conditions allowed. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
