We're getting some reaction now to Israel's aid route announcement. Stephane Dujarric, a spokesperson for UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, says Israel needs to make sure that re-opened aid routes are operational. The Erez Gate in northern Gaza will be temporarily re-opened for the first time since the start of the war and Ashdod Port will also be opened for humanitarian deliveries, Israel says, and more aid from Jordan will be allowed to enter via the Kerem Shalom Crossing. Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme, Dujarric welcomes the move but says it's overdue. "We've been calling for more humanitarian aid for months. . . we will need to see how this is actually implemented," he adds. "Once this phase of the conflict ends, people will need to be held accountable for the violations of the law that we have seen. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
