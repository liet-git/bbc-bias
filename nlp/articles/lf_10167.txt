T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Benjamin Netanyahu spokesperson for the Arab world says the US "has committed" to fund an upgrade to the Rafah crossing. "The US has committed to pay for the upgrade of the Rafah crossing as soon as possible to enable the transfer of humanitarian aid only via Rafah after passing Israeli security screening," Ofir Gendelman says in a post to social media . This comes after Israel confirmed that it would allow aid to pass through the Kerem Shalom goods crossing into Gaza to fulfil its commitment to allow 200 lorries of aid to enter Gaza every day. Gendelman says in the social media post that the Rafah crossing has the capacity for 100 lorries a day, making the implementation of the agreement between Israel and the US impossible. Gendelman adds that the use of the Kerem Shalom crossing is a temporary measure. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
