T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Life was never easy in Gaza, even before this war started on 7 October, with a shortage of electricity, a lack of clean water and sewage being dumped into the sea. There were eight hours of electricity every day. And about 95% of the water was contaminated, so people had to buy drinking water every day. Israel and Egypt had imposed a blockade on the strip since Hamas took control of Gaza back in 2007 after fighting political rivals Fatah. Israel and Egypt restricted the movement of people in and out of Gaza. Sometimes you meet someone who is 40 and has never left Gaza before. There were four major wars and smaller battles in between â€“ every time there was a war in Gaza people were hoping there would be a permanent solution that would bring an end to their suffering. But internal political division in Gaza, and the fact Hamas is designated as a terrorist organisation, also meant there was little stability for people. Unemployment was about 50%. And about 900,000 people used to receive monthly food aid from the UN - about half the population of Gaza relied on the UN for food. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
