The United Kingdom’s Ambassador to the UN, Barbara Woodward, told the council that it was imperative to agree on further urgently needed humanitarian pauses. While the UK does not support a ceasefire, it is expected to abstain when votes are later cast on the draft resolution, according to a UN Security Council diplomat. When the draft resolution was circulated, the UK proposed edits that were included in the final text. The UK takes pride in the fact that it hasn’t exercised its right to use the veto since 1989. The last time we saw the United States veto a draft resolution on 18 October, the UK also abstained. Woodward also told council members that the UK continues to support Israel’s right to defend itself "against Hamas terrorism as it seeks the return of over 100 hostages who are still held in Gaza” but the UK is "absolutely clear that Israel must be targeted and precise in achieving that goal. " The vote is now expected to start at 20:00 GMT , which is 15:00 in New York and 22:00 in Israel and Gaza. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
