Senior Hamas official Bassem Naeem has told the BBC that the ceasefire resolution passed "confirms that the prevailing international will is in favour of stopping the aggression against the Palestinian people". "The party that obstructs this will is the United States of America through its use of the right of veto in the Security Council," Naeem said. "And this not only gives cover for this ongoing [Israeli] aggression but the veto makes America a direct partner in the crimes against the Palestinian people, and this will lead to the isolation of the Zionist entity [Israel] and will also isolate the United States at the international level," the Hamas official added.
