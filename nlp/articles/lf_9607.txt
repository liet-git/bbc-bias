The Palestinian population is divided between historic Palestine and a diaspora, mainly in neighbouring Arab countries. Efforts to create a Palestinian state on the West Bank and Gaza have been frustrated by the continuing conflict with Israel. Palestinians in the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem have lived under Israeli occupation since 1967. The settlements Israel has built in the West Bank are home to 500,000 people and are deemed to be illegal under international law - although Israel disputes this. Palestinians have been striving for self-determination but have achieved only limited control over their affairs. The Palestinian political leadership is deeply divided between the Fatah party in the West Bank and its Islamist militant Hamas opponents, who control the Gaza Strip and who are currently engaged in a war with Israel.
