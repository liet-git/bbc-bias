Not long ago, we heard Conservative MP Sir Charles Walker speaking on the BBC's World at One programme where he's been expressing his support for the Speaker and his decisions. "I donâ€™t think there was any malice behind it," the Tory MP said. There is a real threat to MPs in the current climate, he says, while citing information about security issues that he cannot discuss publicly. This, he claims, is what drove the Speaker's decision. "I can testify that he is obsessed with the safety of members of parliament and their staff. " The Conservative MP assesses Sir Lindsay Hoyle's performance as being "very good to pretty good" over the last five years, adding that there have not been many complaints made about him. "This was a genuine mistake he made for the best of reasons," Walker says. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
