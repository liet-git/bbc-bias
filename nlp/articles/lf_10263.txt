We've been reporting on Israel's ambassador to the UK rejecting a two-state solution once the war in Gaza ends. The "two-state solution" to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is an internationally backed formula which envisages an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza, with East Jerusalem as its capital, alongside Israel. The West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and Gaza – now home to approximately five million Palestinians – were occupied by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war. Palestinians want sovereignty over these territories and an end to Israel’s control. Since 1967, Israel has built about 140 settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, populated by more than 700,000 Jews. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. Palestinians and the vast majority of the international community see the settlements as an obstacle to peace. A two-state solution would involve the removal of the settlements, either fully or partially, possibly leaving some large blocks under Israeli sovereignty. Israel opposes a two-state solution, arguing that it would not bring peace because, it says, Palestinians do not accept Israel’s right to exist in any form. Israel also considers the whole of Jerusalem as its capital and is unwilling to divide it. Previous internationally-backed peace accords between Israel and the Palestinians envisaged a negotiated end to the conflict, without spelling out the creation of a Palestinian state. But the international community sees an independent Palestine living alongside Israel as the only path to a permanent peace.
