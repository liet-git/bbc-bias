Aid to Gaza travelling by sea is returning to Cyprus, Reuters news agency reports, after an Israeli killed seven aid workers. World Central Kitchen staff had just offloaded aid from a barge which sailed from Cyprus when their vehicle convoy was hit on Monday. The barge was part of a four-vessel flotilla which set sail from Larnaca, Cyprus, on 30 March. Another ship - the Jennifer - still loaded with 240 tonnes of food, headed back to Cyprus on Tuesday, without making its delivery, after the charity suspended its operations. "One third (of the aid cargo) was delivered, and two thirds is coming back", a Cypriot official told Reuters. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
