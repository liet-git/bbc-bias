The text of the Security Council humanitarian draft resolution on Gaza has not changed overnight. In past days, the resolution was modified to accommodate the United States’ position – including with toned down language calling for a "suspension" rather than a "cessation" of hostilities. But Washington is seeking more changes in high-level talks. The key sticking point is over the text’s proposal to have a UN mechanism to monitor aid into Gaza – something the Arab group of nations insists must be part of any meaningful resolution. Washington fears that could take away Israel’s control of the screening process. They’ve asked for this latest delay so they can discuss with Egypt how a monitoring mechanism can work for all parties. Robert Wood, deputy US ambassador to the UN, just spoke to reporters at the Security Council stakeout on his way into the chamber for an unrelated meeting on Syria. He said he honestly couldn’t say how the US would vote because they don’t know what the final draft will look like. He said they are still working and hoping to be able to support it. “Stay tuned,” he added. For now, a vote is scheduled to take place later this afternoon after that Syria council meeting.
