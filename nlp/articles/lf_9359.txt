As we continue to bring you voices and perspectives of people living in Gaza, let's take a quick look at the latest developments on a possible ceasefire deal: US President Joe Biden told reporters last night he hopes to see a ceasefire agreement reached by "next Monday" Biden's comments arrived shortly after an Israeli delegation arrived in Qatar for intensive talks with mediators to draw up terms for a deal. The meetings come on the heels of negotiations held in Paris last week, where a basic outline was discussed. It included a 40 day pause in all military operations, the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas, and the release of Palestinian prisoners. But Biden's hopes for an imminent ceasefire have not been shared by Hamas officials, who played down his optimism. Speaking to the BBC, one official familiar with the negotiations said the deal would most likely be rejected because it does not meet the group's minimum requirements. "The priority for us in Hamas is not the exchange of detainees, but the cessation of the war ," the senior Hamas official said. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
