Today is Friday, the day of weekly prayers across the Muslim world. In Iran it has often been the scene of furious, vitriolic speeches vowing to strike a punishing blow against Israel, "the Zionist enemy", the US and others. Yet Iran’s response to this morning’s limited Israeli strikes on its territory has been muted and mild, with some officials even denying outright that it even took place at all. Another mocked it as "a failed attack" involving just a "few quadcopters". It is important for Iran’s leadership, which is facing serious domestic challenges at home, to present itself as victorious in its approach to Israel. Last weekend’s mass Iranian missile and drone strike against Israel has been presented as "teaching the enemy a lesson", even though Israeli air defences and others shot down almost everything and no one was killed. This is partly about saving face and looking strong. But it is also about calibration, deterrence and calculated responses. There are many in Israel’s cabinet who would have liked to see a much bigger attack on Iran today. But Israel’s friends made it clear that would be dangerous and could lead to a wider war that could drag in the US and send energy prices soaring as well as sending thousands fleeing the region. Israel appears to have heeded this appeal but still sent a message: that it can strike close to Iran’s nuclear programme in Isfahan province and that next time it could be with much greater force.
