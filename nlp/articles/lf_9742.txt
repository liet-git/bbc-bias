T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. We’ve heard from Jan Egeland, secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council, who welcomes Israel's aid route announcement, calling it a "turning point". “It's wonderful news,” he says while appearing on BBC Newsday, adding he and others have been calling for this for months. “The border crossings to open in the north will make it possible to reach people in famine within 30-40 minutes by road, which is the only rational and effective way. ”. Although he expresses confidence that Israel will follow through on these commitments, he says the "intrusive and counterproductive" monitoring system used to check aid deliveries needs to change. “I think it now has to be rational. And the United States has to be at these border crossings and have to enable the flow as they have to be in the deconfliction system, so that not more of our aid workers are bombed and killed," he says.
