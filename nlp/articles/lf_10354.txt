Faced with a barrage of questions from the White House press corps on the possibility of a ceasefire deal, Kirby says the talks between Israel and Hamas are at a "critical" and "sensitive" stage. "I don't know that it gets any more sensitive than right now," he adds. When asked whether the success - or failure - of the talks is now dependent on Israel, Kirby says "it's going to depend on what the [Hamas] response actually says". Additionally, Kirby says the US was not aware ahead of time that a Hamas response would come when it did. "We certainly hoped there would be word today," he tells reporters, "but did we know the exact moment? No. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
