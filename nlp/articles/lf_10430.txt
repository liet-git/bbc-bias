We’re getting further reports of camps being set up - and police responses - from across the country. At Emory University in Atlanta, activists pitched tents on campus this morning. Police moved in and there are claims that they used pepper spray and rubber bullets as they detained protesters. The activists said they were supporting Palestinians, but also objecting to a police training centre in Atlanta. Plans for the centre have been controversial locally and the project has been dubbed “Cop City” by opponents. In a statement Emory president Gregory L Fenves said the protesters “are largely not affiliated with Emory and were disrupting the university as our students finish classes and prepare for finals. This is completely unacceptable. ”. Reporters at the scene say several Emory students and faculty are among those detained by police. It's unclear exactly how many people have been arrested. The BBC has contacted Emory for comment. Police detain a protester at Emory University. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
