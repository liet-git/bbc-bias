As the Commons debate continues on a busy afternoon that also saw an uproar at Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle's amendment selections, let’s take a look at what MPs will actually be voting on: First, MPs will vote on Labour's amendment to the SNP motion, which calls for an "immediate humanitarian ceasefire". It emphasises the role of Hamas as well as Israel in bringing about a lasting pause in fighting. It also calls for "rapid and unimpeded" humanitarian relief to be provided in Gaza. Shadow Foreign Secretary David Lammy earlier told the House he felt the SNP motion was "one-sided". If the amendment passes, there will be a second vote on the new, amended motion. If it fails, the SNP's original motion calling for an “immediate ceasefire” in Gaza and Israel will be looked at by MPs. This says a ceasefire is the “only way to stop the slaughter of innocent civilians” and condemns the “collective punishment” of Palestinians. If that fails - which appears likely as it is opposed by both the Conservatives and Labour - a government amendment will be voted on by MPs. It calls for an “immediate humanitarian pause as the best way to stop the fighting and to get aid in and hostages out". It reaffirms Israel’s “right to self-defence” and supports moves "towards a permanent sustainable ceasefire" Both the amendments, and the SNP motion, call for the immediate release of the hostages held by Hamas in Gaza.
