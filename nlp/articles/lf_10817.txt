As we have been reporting, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu has said it is "the beginning of the end for Hamas" - while the IDF's chief of staff, Herzi Halevi, said "we're seeing terrorists surrendering. . . a sign their network is collapsing" . But a military analyst has told the BBC that suggestions Hamas is on the brink of collapse are “wildly optimistic”. Neri Zilber from the Washington Institute for Near East Policy says - that by Israel's count Israel has killed about 7,000 Hamas fighters out of an estimated 25-30,000 troops that Hamas had before the war. He says Hamas has five brigades in Gaza, including two operating in the north that have suffered “extreme damage”, but three are still fighting in the south. Zilber adds that Israel’s goal in destroying Hamas would involve killing its top leaders, destroying most of its dozens of battalions and eliminating its vast stockpile of weapons, particularly rockets. He says he believes there is at least a month left of Israel’s ground operations in Gaza, and “as we know, Hamas is still firing rockets into southern Israel, and sometimes even central Israel". Israeli soldiers were photographed operating with a tank in the Shajaiya district of Gaza City on Sunday. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
