T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. We’re going to take a closer look now at reports from an Israeli news outlet , which claims to have a transcript of a call between Rishi Sunak and Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday night. Sunak reportedly warned Netanyahu: "If there is no change in the introduction of humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip, we will have to declare Israel in violation of international humanitarian law. " The call between the two leaders came after three UK nationals were among seven aid workers killed in an Israeli air strike - an incident Israel says was a “grave mistake” which is being investigated. Diplomatic correspondent for Israel's Channel 13 News, Moriah Asraf Wolberg, says Netanyahu told Sunak Israel would increase the amount of humanitarian aid into Gaza “in the coming days” and is working on a broad aid programme. Downing Street is not commenting on the reported leak, but did, as normally happens after such a call, produce an official read-out. It says Sunak told the Israeli PM he was "appalled" by the killing of the aid workers. “The prime minister said far too many aid workers and ordinary civilians have lost their lives in Gaza and the situation is increasingly intolerable," No 10 says. "The UK expects to see immediate action by Israel to end restrictions on humanitarian aid, deconflict with the UN and aid agencies, protect civilians and repair vital infrastructure. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
