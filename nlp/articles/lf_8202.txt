Next up is Development Minister Andrew Mitchell , who outlines the government's amendment on the SNP's motion. The amendment, which calls for an "immediate humanitarian pause" to fighting in Gaza, also supports Israel's right to self-defence, "in compliance with international humanitarian law" against the attacks by Hamas, he says. Mitchell adds that it supports a move towards a permanent sustainable ceasefire, the formation of a new Palestinian government and Hamas to be unable to launch further attacks. And a credible pathway to a two-state solution and delivers justice for both Israelis and Palestinians and proposes that this "very careful crafted amendment" should be the one to go ahead, he adds.
