We've been looking at some video that's been sent to BBC Persian which show a succession of flashes in the sky. It's said to be above the Iranian city of Isfahan, but verifying footage filmed at night can be difficult because there are few identifiable features. However, two clips have emerged which we checked have not appeared before. When we ran them simultaneously, we could see the sequence of flashes matched perfectly, making us confident they were filmed at the same time from different, but nearby locations. In addition, our colleagues at BBC Persian have told us that accents heard at one point in one video sound similar to those from the Isfahan area.
