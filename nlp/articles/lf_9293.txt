Israeli forces have encircled the home of Yahya Sinwar, head of the Hamas’s political wing in Gaza, according to Israel's PM. Israel believes Sinwar is one of the masterminds behind the 7 October attacks, with IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari describing him as “a dead man”. Sinwar’s whereabouts are unknown, but it’s possible he is cornered underground in Hamas’s warren of tunnels underneath the Gaza Strip. Sinwar, 61, also known as Abu Ibrahim, was born in Khan Younis, after his parents were displaced from Ashkelon in what Palestinians call “al-Nakba” (the Catastrophe) – the mass displacement of Palestinians from their ancestral home in the war that followed Israel's founding in 1948. Sinwar was first arrested by Israel in 1982, aged 19, for “Islamic activities”, and then again in 1985. It was around this time that he won the confidence of Hamas’s founder, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, eventually working his way up the group’s ranks. Read more about Sinwar here.
