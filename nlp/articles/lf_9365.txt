We're hearing again from Nagham Atef Mezied, the 22-year-old medical student residing in Deir al Balah. She's telling us more about scenes from Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital and her hopes for a ceasefire: The relentless barrage of rockets and explosions orchestrated by the Israeli occupation within Gazaâ€™s borders exacts a toll that transcends mere mortality; it robs survivors of limbs, sight, and hearing, plunging them into a perpetual nightmare. In Gaza, we do not merely fear death, we dread the prospect of disability, the erosion of dreams, and the dwindling of hope. The lack of medical supplies, due to the closure of the Rafah crossing and ongoing Israeli restrictions, renders even minor medical interventions a Herculean task. Travel constraints imposed on the wounded and patients seeking treatment abroad compound the peril and exacerbate the decline in health standards. While death may represent a swift end, it is not our sole apprehension. We yearn for cessation, for an urgent ceasefire, and for unimpeded access to vital humanitarian aid, spanning every corner of Gaza, from north to south. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
