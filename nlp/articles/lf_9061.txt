We're seeing images of some minor clashes between police officers and protesters now. It appears there have been some skirmishes and things thrown at officers, mainly by masked protesters. At least one person was tackled to the floor and detained by police. We're seeing some of these images live from a helicopter camera over UCLA, so it's difficult to make out exactly what is going on. But it appears police have stepped back from the encampment, while one protester is heard shouting "don't leave, they're coming back". T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
