When Moshe Leimberg saw his daughter, Mia, emerge from Hamas captivity last week, he was surprised to see her holding Bella, her shih tzu dog. "She was very determined to bring the dog back, and one of the expressions that she has now about the dog is: 'I love you to Gaza and back'," he said. Mia and her mother Gabriela were visiting family in a kibbutz near the Gaza border when they were taken hostage by Hamas during the 7 October attacks. They were released last week. "Luckily for me, Bella is unlike other small dogs, she’s rather quiet… so they didn’t notice her," Mia, 17, told Reuters news agency of her captors. Once they noticed the dog, an argument took place, but she was ultimately allowed to keep Bella. Bella survived on the hostages’ leftover food. Mia said she does not feel traumatised by the experience, but that it is taking time for it all to sink in. She also said it feels "wrong" to be free when her relatives and other people are still being held captive. "It is so important that we bring back everybody. As much as I am happy to be back, we're still not done," she said. Mia Leimberg with Bella. Mia holds Bella, alongside her mum, Gabriela, and her dad, Moshe. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
