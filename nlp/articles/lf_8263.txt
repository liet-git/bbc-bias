 F-N-S-T-A-R-T. 8263 F-N-E-N-D.  D-A-T-E-S-T-A-R-T. 2024-02-21 D-A-T-E-E-N-D.  T-I-T-L-E-S-T-A-R-T. Tricky day for Sunak and Starmer. T-I-T-L-E-E-N-D.  T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Both Rishi Sunak and Sir Keir Starmer will be feeling a little bruised as they make their final preparations for Prime Minister’s Questions. There are a whole range of uncomfortable questions for Sunak this morning. Did the government want the Post Office to “hobble” into the election without solving the company's long-term problems, as alleged by its former chair Henry Staunton? Does the failed test firing of a Trident missile from a Royal Navy submarine raise concerns about the UK’s nuclear defences? And what about the government’s sacking of its own immigration watchdog? But Starmer is coming into PMQ’s with concerns of his own. He will no doubt want to highlight the party’s two new MPs after his double by-election victory last week. But Labour’s position on the Israel-Gaza conflict is once again in the spotlight ahead of the vote on a ceasefire this afternoon. It could be a tricky day for both men. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
