The Israel Gaza war, now in its 193rd day, is a crisis with wide-ranging repercussions across this whole region. Israel says it has killed a senior commander with Lebanon's Hezbollah militia. There was also an exchange of fire between Israel and Hezbollah fighters - Israel says they launched two attack drones into northern Israel, injuring lightly three Israelis. This development on the Lebanon front comes as Israel's' foreign minister launched a diplomatic offensive today, sending messages to more than 30 countries urging them to impose more sanctions against Iran and in particular, on Iran's missile programme. He also called for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) to be designated as a terrorist organisation. Iran as well has been on the phone, talking to foreign ministers in the region and beyond, and also speaking to the UN secretary general, underlining that Iran's unprecedented attack on Israel was in legitimate self defence.
