Last week, President Joe Biden said the US will not supply heavy weapons to Israel which could be used in a major assault on the southern Gazan city of Rafah. In an interview with CNN, Biden said America would continue to give Israel the weapons it needed to defend itself, including interceptors for its “Iron Dome” air defence system. But he said US-supplied heavy weapons had already killed civilians in Gaza, and warned Israel would not keep Washington's support if it carried out military operations in those population centres . In the UK, Foreign Secretary David Cameron has said Britain is opposed to the military operation in Rafah, but is unlikely to follow America in delaying arms sales to Israel. Cameron said circumstances were different as Britain issued licences for a small amount of weapons. On Friday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he hopes to overcome his differences with Biden - but vowed to press ahead with its military assault on Rafah. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
