T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. A spokesperson for the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says "a disastrous and worrying situation" is unfolding at Nasser hospital. In a new statement, Dr Ashraf al-Qudra claims that Israeli troops forced the hospital's administration to send staff, some of their family members, patients and displaced people into an old building at the complex. He says they are without food, milk for the children, and suffering severe water shortages, describing the conditions as "harsh and frightening". The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) claimed it was carrying out today's raid because Hamas fighters were hiding inside the hospital and that Israeli hostages' bodies might also be there. A spokesperson for Hamas denied that, calling it "lies". Video footage from today's raid shows medical staff rushing patients on stretchers through a corridor filled with smoke or dust. Other footage verified by the BBC shows a patient - who is still in their bed - being moved through a corridor where the ceiling is damaged. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
