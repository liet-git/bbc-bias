Representatives of member countries of the UN Security Council are due to visit the border between Egypt and the Gaza Strip today, according to reports, days after a council resolution calling for a humanitarian ceasefire in the territory was defeated by a United States veto. The visit to the Rafah border crossing is being arranged by the United Arab Emirates – which drafted last week’s resolution – whose UN ambassador Lana Nusseibeh said the aim of the trip is to “learn first-hand what is needed in terms of a humanitarian operations scale-up”. Nusseibeh added it is not an official Security Council visit, Reuters reports. According to UAE outlet The National, the only countries on the 15-member council not to join are France, the US and Gabon. A US spokesman told Reuters that it is “working around the clock to try to improve the situation on the ground”. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
