T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Rafah's hospitals can run for just three more days due to dwindling fuel supplies, the director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO) warns. Posting a video statement on X, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus says this is because fuel the organisation had expected to arrive into Gaza via the Rafah crossing on Wednesday was not allowed in. "Already, one of Rafah's three hospitals - the Al-Najjar hospital - has had to shut down. Its patients have been moved elsewhere and hospital staff are removing supplies and some equipment to safeguard them," he says. Ghebreyesus says the WHO has pre-positioned some supplies in warehouses and hospitals, but without more aid going into Gaza "we cannot sustain our lifesaving support to hospitals". He calls for the removal of all obstacles to the delivery of aid, adding that "a ceasefire is needed urgently for the sake of humanity". T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
