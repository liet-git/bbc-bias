Now let's bring you some information on what's been happening today. Israel says it has launched air strikes on the eastern Lebanese city of Baalbek, targeting what it says are Hezbollah infrastructure sites. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) says fighter jets struck a military complex and other Hezbollah infrastructure sites. No casualties have been reported. The IDF says the strikes were in retaliation to Hezbollah's downing of an Israeli drone that was flying over Lebanon on Saturday. Cross-border exchanges of fire between Israel and Hezbollah have intensified since the start of Israel's military campaign against Hamas in Gaza in October. Israeli shelling has reportedly killed more than 270 Hezbollah fighters and around 70 civilians in Lebanon, while tens of thousands of people have been displaced on both sides of the border.
