When you stand here in this elevated position in the city of Sderot looking across to Gaza you really get a panoramic view not just of the skyline - which has been shattered by two months of war - but also of the continuing strikes. We have seen and heard this morning some really intense air strikes in the northern part of the Gaza Strip - very large impacts where we have seen huge column-like plumes of smoke rising into the air coming from what appears to be a couple of key areas. At times we've even felt the pressure wave from the explosions. There was also a rocket attack from Gaza towards us here in Sderot. We heard the sirens which went off here and took cover, as we watched the interception from Israel's Iron Dome missile system . All of this shows just how intense the fighting still is and it is not just around the southern city of Khan Younis. It’s often very active here, and today particularly so. There’s very little sign of a return to the ceasefire we had recently. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
