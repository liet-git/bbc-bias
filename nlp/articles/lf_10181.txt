T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Let's turn to the West Bank, where violence against Palestinians has risen sharply since war broke out in Gaza. The UN says Israeli settlers have killed eight people and injured a further 85. Recent steps by the UK and US governments to ban "extremist" settlers responsible for violence from entering their countries has put this group in the spotlight. The militant settlers belong to a much wider section of settlers motivated by a religious belief that they are returning the biblical land of Judea and Samaria - the modern-day West Bank - to Israel. Their belief in a perceived higher calling distinguishes them from other settler communities who move to the occupied territories for economic or nationalistic but less religious reasons. All settlements in the West Bank are regarded as illegal under intentional law, although Israel disputes this. Today the religious settler movement is embedded in the political fabric of Israel. Underpinning this is the catapult of far-right parties into the mainstream through Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition government. Among the government's senior figures are far-right leaders and settlers like Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich from the Religious Zionist party, who has consistently called for more settlements in the West Bank. Fellow cabinet member, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir from the Otzma Yehudit party, has previously been convicted of inciting racism and supporting terrorism.
