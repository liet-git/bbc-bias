As we've been reporting, Fernando Simon Marman and Louis Har were rescued by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) from Rafah, in southern Gaza. What do we know about Fernando and Louis so far? Fernando, who is 60 years old, and Louis, aged 70, were rescued from Rafah in an operation co-ordinated between the IDF, Israeli police and the Israel Security Agency. IDF forces shielded the pair with their bodies, spokesman Daniel Hagari said in a statement, as the men were rescued from an apartment. The two, who hold Argentinian citizenship, were taken from the second floor of a building in the centre of Rafah to Sheba Medical Center in central Israel for tests. In a statement on X , Argentinian President Javier Milei's office thanked the IDF for rescuing its citizens, saying that during a state visit to Israel last week Milei had requested the release of the Argentine hostages. The pair had been kidnapped from Nir Yitzhak kibbutz by Hamas on 7 October, and held hostage since. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
