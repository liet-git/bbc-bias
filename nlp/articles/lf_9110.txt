T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. The head of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency has said it "is committed to settling the score with the murderers" who carried out the Hamas attack. David Barnea said on Wednesday evening: "It will take time, just like after the Munich massacre, but we will lay our hands on them wherever they will be". The Munich massacre took place in 1972 when Israeli Olympic athletes in Germany were attacked by the Palestinian militant group Black September. "Every Arab mother ought to know that if her son participated, directly or indirectly, in the slaughter of 7 October, his blood shall be upon his own head," Barnea added. Mossad's David Barnea was delegated as Israel's negotiator during talks to agree the hostage release deal. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
