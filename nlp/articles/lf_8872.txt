It’s just turned 12:20 in Israel and Gaza, and 10:20 here in our London newsroom. For those of you just joining us, here’s a look at the headlines: US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken has pressed Israel to do more to protect civilians in Gaza, saying there was a “gap” between its promises and the reality on the ground. Fighting is continuing in the southern city of Khan Younis – where, at the start of the war, Palestinians in north Gaza were told to flee due to heavy bombardment there. Fires have broken out in the Jabalia refugee camp , where Israeli tanks have been firing smoke and fire bombs, a local journalist told the BBC. Hamas says an Israeli soldier who'd been held hostage in Gaza has been killed in a clash between its fighters and Israeli special forces who were conducting a rescue operation.  The BBC is not able to verify this independently. The Palestinian health ministry says Israeli forces shot dead six Palestinians on Friday at al-Fara camp in the north of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Looking ahead, the UN Security Council is set to meet on Friday to vote on whether to call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. It comes after the UN’s humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths said its humanitarian programme in Gaza is "no longer a functioning one”. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
