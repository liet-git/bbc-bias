T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Tehran has called on Western nations to "appreciate Iran's restraint" towards Israel after it attacked the country on Saturday in retaliation for a deadly strike on its consulate in Damascus, Syria. Iran launched more than 300 drones and missiles towards Israel but some 99% of the barrage was intercepted, Israeli officials have since said. "Instead of making accusations against Iran, [Western] countries should blame themselves and answer to public opinion for the measures they have taken against the . . . war crimes committed by Israel" in its war in Gaza, Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani said earlier. Kanani added that Western countries "should appreciate Iran's restraint in recent months". T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
