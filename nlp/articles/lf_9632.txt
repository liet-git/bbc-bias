Nicaragua has asked the UN's highest court to halt German weapons sales to Israel at the start of a landmark case. Germany is accused of breaching the UN genocide convention by sending military hardware to Israel and ceasing funding of the UN's aid agency for Palestinian refugees. Berlin rejects the claims and will present a defence to the International Court of Justice on Tuesday. In 2023, Germany’s arms sales to Israel totalled €300m ($326m; £257m), 30% of Israel’s military equipment purchases and a tenfold increase on 2022. Components for air defence systems and communications equipment accounted for most of the sales, according to the DPA news agency.

Israel rejects accusations that it is engaging in genocidal acts in Gaza and has insisted it has the right to defend itself. Read the full story here .
