T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Labour's John McDonnell has raised a point of order in the House of Commons, complaining that hundreds of protesters, engaging in what's known as a "mass lobby" over the war in Gaza, are being left in the rain. They're waiting to meet their MPs in Westminster Hall to ask them to support an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. The BBC understands only 50 are being allowed in at a time. McDonnell, a former shadow chancellor, said there were "only limited numbers being allowed in when there's quite a sizeable amount of space" available for meetings. He asked if it would be possible to let more people in instead of "being forced to stand outside in the rain". Protesters are flying Palestinian flags and singing as they wait outside parliament.
