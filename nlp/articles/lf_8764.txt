Israeli ground troops have now advanced into the heart of Rafah - locals say they’ve reached a roundabout that’s a key landmark. Overnight, they also seized control of the highest hilltop along the Gaza-Egypt border after reported gun battles with Hamas-led fighters. Intense Israeli air strikes and artillery fire have sent thousands more Palestinians fleeing from the west of the city, including from a tent camp where an Israeli bombing on Sunday ignited a huge blaze. Israel has kept up its attacks despite a ruling by the top UN court last week ordering it to stop its Rafah offensive. On the world stage, the country finds itself increasingly isolated. On Tuesday, Spain, Ireland and Norway are officially recognising a Palestinian state - despite a furious reaction from Israel. Thousands of Palestinians have fled Rafah in recent days amid continuing Israeli strikes. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
