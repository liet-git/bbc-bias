The overnight tragedy adds to the despair in Gaza as the Israeli war against Hamas nears its six-month mark, with nearly 33,000 Palestinians killed, according to the local authorities. Charities say this is one of the most dangerous places for them to operate, with fighting making it virtually impossible for help to reach those who need it the most. Half of the population face catastrophic levels of hunger, and famine is a possibility in the north in the coming weeks. The health system is on the verge of collapse, with some doctors unable to treat patients due to shortages of basic supplies. Some who have survived bombs may not survive hunger and disease. Three-quarters of Gaza’s residents have been displaced, with most living in makeshift shelters or tents in squalid conditions, with scarce access to safe drinking water or food. At least half of the territory’s buildings have been damaged or destroyed, including hospitals, schools, mosques, UN facilities and warehouses with aid. Very little aid is being allowed in, humanitarian agencies say, blaming Israel for creating bottlenecks to intentionally slow down the entry of basic supplies, weaponizing the delivery of aid – claims Israel denies. Despite those chaotic conditions, aid workers – Palestinians and foreigners – continue to operate across Gaza. The work they do is vital amid a deepening crisis. If it stops, even more people are likely to die. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
