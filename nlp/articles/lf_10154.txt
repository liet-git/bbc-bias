T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Antony Blinken's first stop today was a meeting in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. He will then fly to the remote Saudi Arabian town of Al 'Ula to hold talks with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Blinken's focus will be on addressing the threat Houthi rebels pose to shipping in the Red Sea and discussing US proposals for managing a lasting peace in Gaza once the Israeli military campaign ends. State department officials have said that behind closed doors Arab leaders have been more willing to discuss long term planning for the Palestinians on this trip, than on Blinken's previous visits.
