Mother-of-two Ghada El Kurd has moved six times in the last four months. Recently, she's been sheltering in a relative's home in Rafah, but could now be on the move again. "Last night, at 01:00 in the morning, Israel conducted a military operation," she tells BBC Radio 4's Today programme. "They killed many Palestinian people and we were actually inside our homes sleeping, but this is an indicator for us to leave or evacuate Rafah as soon as possible because in other cities - Khan Younis and Gaza City - it was the same scenario. "So again we are planning to move from Rafah. " Ghada describes hearing planes and drones and says she is waiting for an evacuation plan to be announced. "Usually they throw some flyers and publish on social media platforms where to evacuate. So we are waiting," Ghada adds. Ghada El Kurd says she was asleep at her relative's home in Rafah when Israel began striking the city. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
