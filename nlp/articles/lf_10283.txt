T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Joe Biden made some of his most pointed comments on what he described as a “ferocious surge” in antisemitism in the US and around the world during a Holocaust memorial ceremony at the US Capitol. In his 16-minute speech, he warned that too many are “denying, downplaying, rationalising the horrors of the Holocaust“. From there, he drew a line to people who are also forgetting the atrocities of the 7 October Hamas attack on Israel. "It was Hamas that brutalised Israelis," he said. "It was Hamas that took and continues to hold hostages. I have not forgotten. " He repeated his condemnation of what he characterised as the lawless behaviour and hateful rhetoric directed at Jewish people by some pro-Palestinian protesters on US university campuses in recent weeks. “We know scapegoating and demonising a minority is a threat to every minority,” he said. Biden did not address the humanitarian situation of Palestinian civilians in Gaza or the rising American concern about the consequences of an Israeli military invasion of Rafah. If the president feels pressure from pro-Palestinian activists within his own party, it was not on display at the Capitol today, where his speech received a standing ovation. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
