Downing Street has said that "the government is completely united" in its position on the Israel-Hamas war. The prime minister's official spokesperson denied there were splits in opinion between the prime minister, his deputy prime minister and the foreign secretary following statements and interviews over the weekend. The spokesperson told reporters in a regular media briefing that "the government is completely united on this matter. The prime minister set out his position clearly in the statement that he put out on Sunday. " He added "we continue to support Israel's right to self-defence and the UK was obviously shocked by the attacks made by Hamas. As a result we completely stand by Israel's right to their security. " On the issue of UK arms sales to Israel, the spokesperson said, "we will always look to see these decisions are explained" but added that would only happen "while respecting the convention we don't publish legal advice on these issues". He said UK supplies accounted for only 0.02% of Israel's overall arms imports and added "we have one of the most robust arms export regimes in the world". T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
