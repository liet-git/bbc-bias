UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron is visiting Egypt and Jordan this week to push for a "sustainable ceasefire", further humanitarian pauses and the release of hostages. On his second visit to the region, Lord Cameron will progress efforts to step up aid to Gaza and "end Hamas rocket attacks and threats against Israel", the Foreign Office said. Ahead of the visit, Cameron said: "No one wants to see this conflict go on for a moment longer than necessary. "But for a ceasefire to work, it needs to be sustainable. If Israel is still facing Hamas in Gaza with rockets and terror tactics, not only will a ceasefire not be sustainable, a two state solution in the longer term will also not be possible. " Lord Cameron met Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi in Amman, Jordan, today. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
