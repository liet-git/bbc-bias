Next question for Blinken is again on Israel's reported strike on Iran. "Do you have the feeling today's strike was limited so that Iran was not compelled to react, in that sense are you optimistic?" he is asked. He again says that he is not going to speak to reported events. "All I can say is that for our part and for the entire G7, our focus has been on de-escalation and on avoiding a larger conflict. Actually that's been true since day one and the horrific events of October 7. A big part of our approach has been to prevent the conflict from spreading to avoid escalation everywhere. " "Those efforts will continue," Blinken adds. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
