We're hearing again now from UK Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron, this time on the Today programme. The interview kicks off with a question about why British lives should be risked and taxpayers' money spent by getting involved in the conflict. He says the government wants to avoid an escalation of the conflict for the UK's own national interests. "I think it's right this happened," he says, adding that the UK helped avoid lives being lost. He says Iran attempted a massive attack on Israel, and had it been successful, there could have been thousands of casualties. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
