Naim al-Khatib fled Gaza to Egypt in November, and describes the difficult emotions when he was forced to leave his home unsure of when he would return. "It was a lot of mixed feelings actually," he says. "On one hand I'm happy to have saved myself and my family during the hardship and plight of war. " But on the other hand he is worried that he won't be able to return home to Gaza City. He describes how he fled with just a "few clothes and few papers", and left behind friends and family. "All my life is there waiting for me. " Al-Khatib was forced to flee twice before eventually leaving the Gaza Strip for Egypt in November. He says he was allowed to leave because one of his daughters holds an American passport. Speaking to me from Cairo, he says those mixed feelings remain  - he wants to return, but fears what he will find when he gets back. "I'm worried I won't be able to get back to my home to Gaza, but I have no plans to leave Gaza. I left it forcibly for the single reason of saving my family," he says. But at the same time, he adds, he is worried that he has lost the means to support three college-going children. "Getting back immediately to Gaza worries me also, because I don't know how life is like at the moment, whether I will be able to resume a normal life, get back my financial resources. All that worries me and keeps me up at night. " Naim al-Khatib is from Gaza City, which has seen some of the heaviest Israeli bombardment - he is pictured here in a cafe during happier times. Al-Khatib celebrated his children's graduation from high school in September 2023. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
