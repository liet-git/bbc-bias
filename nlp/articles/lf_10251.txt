T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. The head of the UN’s agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) has described extremely difficult conditions in Rafah in southern Gaza, following a recent visit to the Strip. Philippe Lazzarini explains Rafah does not have the infrastructure to host the more than one million people who have fled there from other parts of Gaza, many of whom have been forced to move more than once. Speaking at a press conference in Geneva, he says the city has quadrupled in population, with the situation worsening since Israel's offensive in the south began in recent weeks. Lazzarini says there are tens of thousands of people living outside UNRWA shelters. Those that found space inside are the “lucky ones", he says, compared to the people outside living "in the open, in the cold, in the mud, and under the rain". Lazzarini adds that it is increasingly difficult to get aid to the shelters because of the sheer number of people crammed into the areas outside. Nearly 1.9 million people - more than 85% of Gaza's population - have been displaced since Israel began retaliatory bombardments following the Hamas attacks on 7 October, which killed 1,200 people. Lazzarini also describes acute hunger in Gaza, with desperation driving many to stop aid trucks to steal food, which is then eaten “on the spot”. We meet more and more people who haven’t eaten for one, two, or three days. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
