T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. A UN humanitarian official says people in Gaza need an "end to this war", which "unfortunately is not what has come out of the Security Council today". Speaking to the BBC News channel from Rafah, Gemma Connell from the UN's Office for the Coordination of Human Affairs (OCHA), says they welcome the effort to expand the aid effort in south Gaza. But she says unfortunately that is also not what relief workers need, instead calling for a "massive volume" of private sector goods to flow into Gaza as well as humanitarian aid - in order to "reverse the desperation and devastation that I see here every day". Connell says she visited al-Ahli hospital Gaza City and instead of seeing the chaos and "carnage that you see on the news", people are instead "waiting to die because they cannot any longer be treated" at the facility. She tells the story of meeting 10-year-old girl whose entire family had been killed by a bombing, then had to have her leg amputated for a second time after contracting an infection at the hospital. The hospitals, the health infrastructure here that has been so increasingly under attack, is not just crumbling - it has fully crumbled. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
