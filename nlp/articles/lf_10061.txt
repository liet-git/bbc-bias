T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. The US embassy in Jerusalem has recently lifted its "shelter in place" order for US employees, saying the threat of "drone and/or missile barrages has diminished". Previous travel restrictions that the US placed on employees remain, with people limited to travel within and between the cities of Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and Beâ€™er Sheva. The statement adds that the US will "continue to closely monitor the security environment", and that schools remain closed (though most Israeli school children are getting their first day of Passover break) and many flights have been delayed or cancelled. It also tells US citizens to remain cautious and aware of personal security. Separately, the IDF has said Israelis across the country no longer needed to stay near protected rooms, but restrictions on gatherings remain in place. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
