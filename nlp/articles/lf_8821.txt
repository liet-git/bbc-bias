The United States has historically shielded its ally Israel from almost all criticism in the UN Security Council. So, in many ways, today’s outcome was expected. But given the enormity of the human suffering in Gaza, many non-governmental organisations believe today’s veto damages America’s credibility on human rights. “A vote against humanity,” the medical charity, Doctors Without Borders, called it. The US is finding itself increasingly isolated on the international stage. In less than 24 hours, 97 nations signed on as co-sponsors to the resolution - symbolically voting alongside the 13 council members who want a ceasefire urgently. The Biden administration argues a ceasefire will benefit Hamas, and has stepped up pressure on Israel to protect civilians. But some at the UN accuse it of being complicit in the consequences of Israel’s military operation. The risk is that the conflict will come to be seen as America’s, and not just Israel’s war.
