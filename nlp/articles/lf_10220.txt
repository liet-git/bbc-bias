It's 03:20 in Israel and Gaza, and 01:20 here in London. Over a live video feed from Gaza, shrouded in darkness, we have just seen a bright red flash in the distance. We can hear the chatter of machine-gun fire, and the whirring of drones or other aircraft is constant. It is clear that Israel's offensive against Hamas continues unabated. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has told US President Joe Biden's National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, that Israel will continue the war until "absolute victory". The US called on Israel to scale down its war in the "near future", with Biden urging more to be done to protect civilian lives in Gaza. Sullivan pushed the Israeli government on the timescales of the conflict after Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant told him it would last several more months. Sullivan will head to the occupied West Bank city of Ramallah later on Friday for talks with Palestinian Authority leaders. Washington has strongly backed Israel's right to defend itself following the Hamas attacks in October but mounting civilian casualties have caused growing tension between the close allies.
