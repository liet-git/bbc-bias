"I was in the safe room with my children for 19 hours and somehow we managed to survive. "My father was murdered on the Saturday," he says, adding that the family didn't know what had happened to his mother until two weeks ago, when "we were told that she was murdered in Gaza by Hamas". He calls for the release of all the remaining hostages: "Please, bring them all home. Now.
