However, the lack of electricity means that sewage cannot be pumped away leaving the water contaminated. A Palestinian doctor told the BBC that this was increasing the spread of disease.  “The sea water is especially polluted next to the shelters where some people bathe their children,” says Dr Khalil al-Degran at Deir al-Balah’s al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Hospital. “We’ve got a textbook formula for epidemics and a public health disaster,” says Lynn Hastings the U. N. Humanitarian Coordinator for the Occupied Palestinian Territory.  The vast majority of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million has fled their homes. Many are sleeping rough, leaving them vulnerable to illnesses.  The World Health Organisation has estimated about 360,000 cases of disease – including meningitis, jaundice, chickenpox and upper respiratory tract infections. Outbreaks of diarrhoea among small children are a particular problem. UNRWA, the UN body responsible for Palestinian refugees, has drawn attention to the increasingly insanitary conditions in its overcrowded shelters.  It says that for those in Rafah, there are 486 people for one toilet. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
