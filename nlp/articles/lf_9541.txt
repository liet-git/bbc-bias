Polish President Andrzej Duda is echoing calls made earlier by several world leaders as he demands an explanation for the deaths of the volunteers killed in the Israeli air strike in Gaza. "It is with deep pain that I learned about the deaths in the Gaza Strip of the volunteers from the World Central Kitchen organisation, including a Polish citizen. My thoughts are with their loved ones," President Duda posted on X. "These brave people changed the world for the better with their service and dedication to others. This tragedy should never have happened and must be explained," he adds.
