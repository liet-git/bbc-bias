T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Israel has been scrambling to find out what went wrong in Rafah on Sunday. How did a “precision strike” using specialised munitions with “reduced warheads” result in a firestorm which killed dozens and injured scores? Following last week’s ruling by the International Court of Justice, ordering Israel to halt any operations in the Rafah area that might inflict further harm on the Palestinian population, Israel knows that the eyes of the world are on it. It’s under enormous pressure to explain its actions. It says the operation was based on intelligence, and it seems Hamas figures were killed. But the presence of huge numbers of civilians and, it seems, a significant quantity of flammable material, raises a great many questions about how this incident was planned and executed. But whether this marks a turning point in the campaign is another matter. Benjamin Netanyahu remains committed to what he calls “total victory” in Rafah, so there’s no sign that this will change his mind. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
