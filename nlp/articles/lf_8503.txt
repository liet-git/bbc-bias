Louise Wateridge from UNRWA agency told the BBC this morning that the area, which was packed with makeshift shelters a week ago, has a lot of space now as families are getting ready to leave. “The people here have the fear of knowing you are trapped. They know aid is not coming in - that sends panic,” she said. The Rafah crossing, through which humanitarian aid had been coming into the enclave, has been closed for several days. People are wondering where they are going to get food and water, Wateridge says. “If this military operation continues, it's going to be the final corner of Gaza that's destroyed and that is very terrifying for the people here,” she adds.
