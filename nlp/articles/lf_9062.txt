In the past ten minutes, what could have been either a firework or flash-bang lit up the dark early hours sky over the encampment, momentarily stunning the crowds gathered here, causing the media to scramble. It's impossible to tell whether it came from demonstrators or gathered authorities. But the calls by police to disperse have been ramping up in urgency and frequency - and there's the sense that between now and the early morning police could move in. Footage from the scene also shows police officers have moved to within a few feet of a line of protesters, and appear to be speaking to some of those gathered there. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
