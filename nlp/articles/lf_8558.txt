UK military exports to Israel came to £42m in 2022 (representing about 0.02% of Israel's total), according to the UK government . And since 2008 the UK has licensed over £547m worth of arms to Israel, according to the House of Commons Library. But this figure doesn’t include components for military equipment, like parts for US-made F-35 fighter jets, which are sold via Open General Export Licence (OGEL). These licenses allow companies to sell unlimited amounts of specific equipment to several countries. The pressure group Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT), estimates that British parts account for 15% of the value of F-35s, and 36 of these jets have been sold to Israel - bringing in at least £368m to the UK arms industry. But compared with other countries, the UK is a relatively small supplier. According to data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, the US has been Israel's main supplier for more than a decade. Between 2011 and 2023 the US accounted for two-thirds of arms transfers to Israel, while Germany supplied just under 30%. However, this data only includes major weapons systems like aircraft, ships, missiles, artillery, air defence systems and armoured vehicles. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
