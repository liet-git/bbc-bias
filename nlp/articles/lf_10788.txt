South Africa has accused Israel of violating the UN's 1948 Genocide Convention. It has requested provisional measures, which would have a similar effect as a restraining order or temporary injunction. In order to determine whether the legal requirement has been met, 17 judges - 15 permanent justices, plus one each from South Africa and Israel - must answer two questions: Whether South Africa has met the basic test to show that its claim against Israel is plausible. Whether the Palestinian population in Gaza faces a real and imminent risk of irreparable harm. If the court finds the threshold has been met, then it will decide which if any of the nine provisional measures requested by South Africa should be granted. The judges are not limited to South Africa's specific requests. The panel could simply instruct Israel to ensure its military operations comply with international law and to ensure food, water or medical deliveries are reaching civilians. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
