The sight of billowing black smoke rising up from a tanker in the Red Sea sends shivers through the shipping industry. A decade ago it was Somali maritime piracy that made navigating through the narrow Bab El-Mandeb Strait that separates Africa from the Arabian peninsula a hazardous undertaking. Today, it is a case of running the gauntlet of drones and ballistic anti-ship missiles fired by Iranian-backed Houthis from the part of Yemenâ€™s coast that they control. The Houthis, a tribal militia that seized power illegally nine years ago, have declared their support for Hamas by announcing their intention to attack any Israeli-owned vessel or one visiting Israeli ports. The latest attacks follow several earlier ones in the southern Red Sea, pushing up insurance premiums and potentially making some ships go all the way round Cape of Good Hope to avoid the Red Sea. The US is under pressure from Israel to do something about these attacks but Washington is reluctant to target the Houthi missile sites for fear of widening the Israel-Hamas conflict and triggering retaliation by Iran. Instead, we are likely to see a multinational naval coalition forming to protect shipping and shoot down any incoming missiles and drones. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
