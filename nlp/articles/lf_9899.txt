UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini told reporters in Brussels that there is a "deep sense of panic" over the prospect of an unfolding military operation in Rafah. He describes the toll of war on the people of Gaza as "unspeakable", with 5% of the estimated population of two million having been killed, injured or currently missing. Lazzarini says there are around 300,000 people trapped in northern Gaza, facing "possible starvation" because the UN's refugee agency for Palestinians has not been able to deliver food there since 23 January. He adds the ongoing attacks in Rafah mean it is becoming more and more difficult to operate, with local police unable to protect UN aid lorries yesterday for the first time because of the fighting in the city. This led to the lorries being looted at the border, he says. Civil order is breaking down in Rafah, he adds, with police reluctant to help protect the convoys in the face of the risk to their lives.
