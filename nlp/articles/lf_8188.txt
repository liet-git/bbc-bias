Back in the House, Conservative MP Theresa Villiers has the floor next. Everyone in this chamber wants fighting to stop and the conflict to come to an end, she says. While the government must do everything to secure another humanitarian pause, she continues, demanding an immediate ceasefire "amounts to asking Israel to unilaterally lay down its arms while its hostages remain in peril". She says unless Hamas is defeated and removed from power, there is nothing to stop it rebuilding its capacity to commit "heinous acts of terrorism". She fears an immediate ceasefire would amount to "abandoning Israel during its time of need". The government motion has her support, she says. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
