The health ministry in Gaza, which is controlled by Hamas, says that Israeli air strikes early on Thursday morning killed at least 19 people. There’ve been growing signs of disagreement between Israel and its closest ally, the US, ahead of the arrival of the White House national security adviser, Jake Suillivan. This week, President Joe Biden blamed Israel’s “indiscriminate bombing” of Gaza for a loss of global support for its war on Hamas. Ahead of his trip, Sullivan was quoted as saying that he’d discuss a timetable to end the war and urge Israeli leaders to "move to a different phase from the kind of high-intensity operations seen today”. Reacting to growing international calls for a ceasefire, Israel’s Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, told soldiers in Gaza, “We’re continuing until Hamas is annihilated… Nothing will stop us. ”.
