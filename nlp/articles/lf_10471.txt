A full report of the raid, which will be updated with any further developments, is available here. BBC Verify have analysed the footage that has emerged from from the hospital, which you can view here. You can click here for the most recent developments in Rafah - after days of air strikes  and the looming prospect of an Israeli ground offensive on the southern Gazan city. Want to read an explainer of why Israel and Hamas are fighting in Gaza? We've got one here. This page was edited Adam Durbin, Paul Gribben and Marita Moloney. The writers were Jake Lapham, Ruth Comerford, Ali Abbas Ahmadi, George Wright and Emily Atkinson. We've got one more post to come from our diplomatic correspondent Paul Adams, who reports from Jerusalem. Thank you for joining us. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
