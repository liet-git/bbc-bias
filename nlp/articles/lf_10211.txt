T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Videos emerged on social media yesterday showing Israeli troops praying and singing down a microphone in a mosque in Jenin in the occupied West Bank, prompting the IDF to condemn the behaviour. This morning, a senior politician in Israel said it's "shameful" that IDF soldiers were suspended after they sang Hebrew songs in a mosque, despite the IDF saying the soldiers acted against "codes of conduct within a religious establishment". Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir posted on X that the soldiers are “heroes” who “risked their lives for us in the Jenin operation". Gvir also criticised Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for “bringing politics into the IDF" and "hurting the morale of its fighters". The IDF said those responsible "were immediately removed from operational activity". An Israeli soldier using a microphone to recite a prayer in a mosque in Jenin. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
