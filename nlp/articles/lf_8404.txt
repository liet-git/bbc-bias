The Middle East director at NGO International Communities Organisation says if Israel wants all hostages held by Hamas freed, any deal will most likely have to involve the return of all Palestinian prisoners. Gershon Baskin negotiated the release of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit in return for over 1,000 Palestinian prisoners in 2011. He tells the BBC News channel that a UN vote on a ceasefire resolution - which was delayed on Tuesday - would not “have much impact” on the ground. He says this is because Israel will continue bombing Gaza until “its war goals are met”, which he defines as “dismantling Hamas’s ability to rule the Gaza Strip”. He believes Israel's openness to a ceasefire is due to “local pressure” from the families of hostages. During a six-day ceasefire at the end of November, 105 hostages were released in exchange for Palestinians held in Israeli jails. If Israel wants to return all the hostages, the likely deal that would work with Hamas is the release of all the Palestinian prisoners in Israel, which today numbers more than 7,600 people.
