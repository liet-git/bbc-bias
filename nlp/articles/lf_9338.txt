The resumption of fighting in Gaza has intensified the hunger crisis in Gaza, a UN aid agency said, as it called for a humanitarian ceasefire. The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) said it reached about 250,000 people during the seven-day pause in fighting that ended on Friday. But it says the distribution of aid is now "almost impossible" and the continuation of the conflict "endangers the lives of humanitarian workers". The WFP stressed that humanitarian workers "safe, unimpeded, and sustained access" to Gaza so it can "distribute life-saving assistance throughout the territory". "WFP calls for a humanitarian ceasefire and urges all leaders to work with the utmost urgency to find political solutions that can end the suffering of families on all sides of this harrowing conflict," it said in a statement.
