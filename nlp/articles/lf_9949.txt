Former Home Secretary Suella Braverman asks the prime minister why the UK isn't proscribing Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) a terrorist organisation. On Saturday night, the IRGC said it had launched the drones and missiles towards Israel. Sunak says Braverman knows he won't comment on potential proscription decisions. The prime minister adds that the UK government recognises the threat posed by Iran and has taken measures to counter it at home and around the world. He says he's satisfied that the UK's security services have the tools they need to mitigate the threat from Iran. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
