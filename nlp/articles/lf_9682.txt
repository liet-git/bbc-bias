T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. You join us as the UN Security Council has passed a resolution calling for an "immediate ceasefire" in Gaza - something the body has repeatedly tried and failed to do since the war began in October. It became possible after the US refrained from vetoing the measure in a change from its previous position - signalling a growing divergence between Washington and its ally Israel over the offensive in Gaza. The UN resolution also demands the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages. Stick with us as we bring you the latest updates - and analysis of what this means - right here. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
