The assassination of Hamas's deputy leader, Saleh al-Arouri, has been seen as a pivotal moment precisely because he's the most senior member of the group to have been killed since Israel went to war with it after 7 October. The 57-year-old was deputy chairman of Hamas's political bureau and the founding commander of the Al-Qassam Brigades, the group's military wing. Arouri joined Hamas in 1987, leading the Islamic student movement and helping establish the group's military presence in the West Bank. He had been based in Lebanon prior to his death, acting as a connection between his group and Hezbollah. More here. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
