British, Polish, Australian, and Palestinian citizens were killed in Monday's strike, along with a US-Canadian dual national. In a statement, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said he was “appalled” by the deaths. “Israel must explain how this tragic incident happened and take immediate steps to protect aid workers and facilitate vital humanitarian operations in Gaza,” he said. He added that the situation in Gaza was becoming "increasingly intolerable" and that "far too many aid workers and ordinary civilians have lost their lives”. US President Joe Biden said he was “outraged and heartbroken” by the deaths and that the investigation into them “must be swift” and “must bring accountability”. He also said that Israel has “not done enough to protect civilians”. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the incident was “completely unacceptable" and would “add to the concern” about the ongoing loss of life in Gaza. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said his country "showed full solidarity with Israel" following the 7 October attacks but that that solidarity was being put "to a really hard test". T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
