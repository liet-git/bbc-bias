We last shared a post about Sami Abu Omar this morning . A few hours later, we heard from him again when he was still at the food distribution centre, serving up soup, before the connection dropped out. At our last point of contact, he said they had got through four pots of lentil soup, served up to displaced families. He said they would continue doing it throughout the day. “Today it’s cloudy and there might be rain soon. Our mothers, when this kind of weather comes, make lentil soup, so we’ve done this too for the displaced people so they feel more like they’re at home,” he said.
