If you're just joining us, or need a recap, the UN Security Council has, for the first time, passed a resolution calling for an "immediate ceasefire" in Gaza. The resolution - which was approved by 14 of the 15 UN Security Council's members - passed after the US abstained, instead of vetoing. Immediately after the measure was announced, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cancelled an Israeli delegation's visit to the White House this week - accusing the US of a position shift. White House spokesman John Kirby insisted it didn't show a shift in policy. He added the US was "very disappointed" with Israel cancelling its trip, but would continue to hold talks with its ally. Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian representative to the UN, said it had taken "over 100,000 Palestinians killed and maimed . . . for this council to finally demand an immediate ceasefire" - and that it was a "vote for humanity to prevail" US Representative to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield abstaining during the vote today.
