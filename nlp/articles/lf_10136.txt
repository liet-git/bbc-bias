Gemma Connell, spokeswoman for the United Nations' Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), tells the BBC that al-Aqsa hospital - which is the only medical facility in the central Gaza strip - is on the verge of shutting down. Connell says al-Aqsa is "the single remaining hospital in the middle area of Gaza", where a "major offensive is under way". As well as a high number of casualties, she explains, the hospital's ability to function is jeopardised "every single day". The withdrawal of humanitarian organisations from the hospital, such as the International Rescue Committee pulling its medics, will lead to "the crippling of the single last remaining trauma centre", Connell adds. It all comes after the Israeli military increased its activities near the medical facility. "The situation in the hospital is dire. We have just a single doctor who is working in the emergency room. "You have only two surgeons left responding to hundreds of needs in that hospital. You have so many casualties coming in every single hour who are in desperate need of life saving support. " Palestinians wounded lie on beds as displaced people shelter at Shuhada al-Aqsa Hospital. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
