Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has, again, said the war against Hamas will continue “until absolute victory”. This time, the remarks were made as he met the US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, who is visiting Israel as calls grow for a ceasefire in Gaza amid mounting casualties and a worsening humanitarian crisis. Since launching the war in response to the 7 October attacks carried out by Hamas, Netanyahu has vowed to eliminate the group. Vast areas of Gaza have been turned into ruins and more than 18,000 people have been killed, according to the local health authorities, including around 7,000 children. Hundreds of thousands of others have been displaced, and are now struggling to survive amid widespread shortages of basic supplies. Sullivan came to Israel to discuss a possible timeline for the end of the conflict. But is Israel close to eradicating Hamas? Defence Minister Yoav Gallant told Sullivan that destroying the group would take “more than several months”. Israeli military officials reportedly say they still need weeks before they can finish intensive operations. Benjamin Netanyahu meeting Jake Sullivan, the US national security adviser. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
