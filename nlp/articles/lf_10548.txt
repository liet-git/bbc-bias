We’ve been hearing from witnesses about the intense Israeli shelling in Rafah. Footage from last night at the Kuwaiti Hospital showed a series of children, including a baby, with bloody wounds being rushed inside. Some men were carried in on stretchers wincing in pain.  Medics say they treated 25 casualties who came from a nearby neighbourhood. “They started shelling us: children, women and older people,” a witness Khaled Taweel told the BBC. “They said “a limited incursion” but we saw that last night they entered right by the Yousef al-Najjar Hospital [in eastern Rafah]. ”. A British physician, Dr James Smith, said in a voice message: “The strikes in Rafah have been non-stop all night. ”. With blasts audible in the background, he said: “I’m hearing one every ten seconds. ”. Crowds of Palestinians are said to have been fleeing along the coastal road. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
