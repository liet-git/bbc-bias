Children were among the Palestinian casualties rushed to hospital after the latest Israeli bombing of Khan Younis in southern Gaza. Other strikes hit Deir al Balah and Rafah, towns that tens of thousands of Gazans have recently fled to, seeking safety. Israel’s military has warned that the war will continue throughout this year, but the defence minister has now said it will soon be safe for displaced Israelis from some communities near Gaza to return home. Other Israeli ministers have been reacting angrily to the Supreme Court’s decision yesterday to nullify a controversial law which had weakened its own powers. Ministers accused the court of overstepping its authority. However, there was praise from opposition politicians who say the national crisis caused by the contentious judicial changes over the past year may have contributed to Hamas’s decision to carry out its deadly attacks on the 7 October.
