Just before this week's programme finished, the panel shared their closing thoughts with Laura Kuenssberg. Laura asks what the panel makes of countries “co-ordinating to try to undermine democracies”, and also asks what effect would former president Donald Trump being voted back into the White House have on Ukraine? Former Cabinet Secretary Lord Mark Sedwill says let’s not be obsessed by our adversaries. “They don’t have a real alliance, it’s transactional. ”. He adds Trump is unpredictable and “extremely challenging”. Comedian Ruby Wax says the other “elephant in the room” is the issue of mental health, saying “we really have to deal with this domestic problem. " If we are living in an age of anxiety, how can leaders confront that, Laura asks Baroness Valerie Amos. She says we are seeing a general anxiety in people across the country and the world. Wellbeing is a major issue about the now, but also about the future that they “don’t know and understand”. “We have to prepare people for a world of greater instability," she adds. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
