T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Israeli authorities have said the Kerem Shalom crossing between Israel and Gaza will open tomorrow for aid inspections in order to allow more supplies to enter Gaza. This "will double the volume of aid" delivered admitted into the territory, Israel's Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (Cogat) said in a post on X. Until now, Israel has inspected aid trucks at Nitzana, 25 miles (40km) south along the Egyptian-Israeli border, before they travel into to Gaza via the Rafah crossing between Egypt and Gaza. Kerem Shalom will be used only to screen aid trucks to speed up the process - the aid will still enter via the Rafah crossing. Earlier, Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa), spoke of the urgent need of a ceasefire to ensure "meaningful aid" is delivered to Gaza. Speaking to the UAE-based The National newspaper, Lazzarini said the needs in Gaza where "absolutely immense" and "what comes in still remains a crumb compared to the needs of the people".
