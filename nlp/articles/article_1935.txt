Belgium will not host their Nations League match against Israel on 6 September over security concerns, the Belgian Football Federation (RBFA) has announced. The municipal government of Brussels said last month the "very high-risk" Nations League game would not be played at the King Baudouin Stadium because it could spark demonstrations. Other cities in the country have since also refused to host the match, so a city outside of the country may be designated to stage the game. The Israel-Gaza conflict has sparked demonstrations around the world, including in Belgium. In October, a gunman killed two Swedish people before a Euro 2024 qualifier between Belgium and Sweden in Brussels. Belgian prosecutors initially said there did not appear to be any links between the attack and the Israel-Gaza war, but later said they could not exclude that possibility. The match was later abandoned at half-time for security reasons. Belgium and Israel are joined in their Nations League group by France and Italy.  T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
