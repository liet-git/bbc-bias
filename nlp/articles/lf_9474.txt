Let's now turn our attention to Israel, where protests are continuing in Jerusalem against the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, with thousands taking part since Saturday. Families of Israeli hostages stormed the Knesset (Israeli parliament) today and smeared paint across the glass in the gallery. They're calling for the immediate release of hostages, Netanyahu's government resignation and a general election. The protests have gathered in intensity as the war against Hamas in Gaza nears the end of its sixth month and anger at the government's handling of around 130 Israeli hostages who are still held by Hamas has grown. Protesters smeared yellow paint, associated with the struggle for the return of hostages, on the glass. Security guards were seen pulling protestors away from the glass partition. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
