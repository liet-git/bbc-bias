As fighting continues in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, we've seen signs of conflict from cameras in southern Israel overlooking the border all morning. We've heard the distant but constant rumble of what may be explosions and buzz of aircraft engines from these viewpoints. At times, we've seen large plumes of smoke rising from the tightly clustered buildings in Gaza. We know fighting continued overnight in southern Gaza's main city. On Wednesday, Israeli soldiers said they had broken through Hamas' defensive lines and carried out "targeted raids in the heart of the city". View of Gaza from southern Israel. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
