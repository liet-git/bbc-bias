 F-N-S-T-A-R-T. 8281 F-N-E-N-D.  D-A-T-E-S-T-A-R-T. 2024-02-21 D-A-T-E-E-N-D.  T-I-T-L-E-S-T-A-R-T. All eyes on Commons Speaker this morning. T-I-T-L-E-E-N-D.  T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. How the day plays out will depend on the choices made by Sir Lindsay Hoyle - the Commons Speaker. This is because the government has put its own amendment to the SNP motion, calling for "an immediate humanitarian pause". It's up to Hoyle to choose which amendment to pick - and given there is a government motion it's less likely he will choose the Labour one for debate. This threatens to expose Labour splits over the issue. So, all eyes on Hoyle. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
