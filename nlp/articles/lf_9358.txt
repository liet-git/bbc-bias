We’ve just heard more from Nashwa Rezeq . Like others we’ve been speaking to today, she tells us of the difficulty of finding food. “We buy canned goods and we buy vegetables, and the prices of canned goods and vegetables are very expensive and ridiculous. We try to save as much as we can and we are forced to sleep hungry because even bread is not always available,” she says via WhatsApp. “Water prices have also become astronomical,” she says. “We have forgotten the luxuries of life. ”. She has four children and says the situation with education is “disastrous”. “The schools have all become a place for the displaced - filled with a lot of people and garbage and sewage. Nobody is talking about education at all. It is becoming a thing of the past," she says. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
