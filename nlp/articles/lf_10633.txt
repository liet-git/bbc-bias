T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Sirens have been sounding constantly over Jenin for the past 15 minutes. They are calling people to take to the streets in support of their "brothers" in Gaza and those in the Jenin refugee camp, under siege, they say, by Israelâ€™s army. Just before the sirens began, a long barrage of gunfire including what sounded like automatic weapons and rockets, came from the area around the camp, and smoke could be seen rising. Local journalists say the Israeli army has destroyed several houses in the Jenin camp today, and that ambulances have been unable to get through. Those living near the camp entrances are reportedly messaging people, asking them to bring food, saying they're unable to leave their homes. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
