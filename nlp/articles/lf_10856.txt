If you're just joining us, here's a look at what's been happening on Sunday - the 65th day of the Israel - Hamas war. Israel has ordered civilians to leave the centre of Khan Younis - the main city in southern Gaza, and the place people were told to head from the north when the war started. A senior official says he doesn't want civilians caught in the crossfire during "difficult fighting" there. The Head of the World Health Organization (WHO) says Gaza's health system is "on its knees" and that Israel's actions in the territory are creating "ideal conditions for disease to spread" The Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh - who has no control of the Gaza Strip, which is governed by Hamas - has called for countries to sanction Israel for its bombardment of Gaza. Meanwhile his Israeli counterpart, Benjamin Netanyahu, has accused a number of Western leaders of a two-faced attitude to Hamas , saying: â€œYou cannot on the one hand support the elimination of Hamas and on other pressure us to end the war, which would prevent the elimination of Hamas" The UN boss and Qatar - which has been acting as a mediator - have today vowed to k eep up efforts to pressurise both sides into a lasting ceasefire. Questions have been raised about footage circulating on Israeli social media, which appears to show people surrendering to Israeli soldiers in northern Gaza . The Israeli military did not directly address the matter when asked for comment, but BBC Verify has been looking into this in depth, and will have an update for you soon.
