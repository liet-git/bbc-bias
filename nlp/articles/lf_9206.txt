It's nearly two hours since we first heard reports of explosions in Iran. Here's what we know so far: Two US officials have confirmed to the BBC's US partner CBS News that an Israeli missile has struck Iran. Early Friday morning, explosions were heard around the central city of Isfahan, Iranian media reported, saying three drones were destroyed after the country's air defence systems were activated. Isfahan is home to an Iranian air base and the province has several military sites. There are no reports so far that anything was hit and Iranian media says all nuclear facilities are safe. Meanwhile, several flights have been diverted around Iran's airspace, tracking sites show. Israel's military and the Pentagon have both declined to comment so far. Some background. It comes after Iran launched more than 300 missiles and drones towards Israel on 13 April in an unprecedented attack. Tehran has maintained this attack was in response to a suspected Israeli strike on its Syria consulate which killed 13 people. Israel and Western allies were able to down most of them before they reached Israeli territory. Israel had indicated that it would hit back to deter Iran from striking again, though international leaders have been urging the country to show restraint. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
