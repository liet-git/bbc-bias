T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. There appears to be no let up in the fighting in southern Gaza as Israeli forces continue to warn residents about their operations targeting Hamas south of the Strip - especially in the Khan Younis area where Israel says it believes Hamas leaders are hiding. Khan Younis was the focus of fierce fighting yesterday and "urgent instructions" given to civilians today suggest that will continue, according to IDF spokesman for the Arabic media, Avichay Adraee. The IDF has said it will not allow civilians to use the Salah al-Din road - the main road crossing the length of Gaza used as an evacuation route from northern Gaza. The road is a "battlefield" and "extremely dangerous" to reach, Adraee posted on X, formerly Twitter. Despite the warnings, mass casualties have meant the main hospital in southern Gaza has become overwhelmed - medics say wards are desperately overcrowded with patients stretched out on bloodstained floors. The scale of the fighting means 600,000 people are under evacuation orders in southern Gaza, according to the UN. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
