The question of which amendment or amendments are voted on is one for Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Commons Speaker, who will make a decision this morning. He will take advice from his clerks on what to do, in accordance with Commons conventions. Some procedural experts believe it is most likely that Sir Lindsay will select only the government amendment. But it's very unusual for both the government and the main opposition party to be seeking to amend another opposition partyâ€™s motion - and as we saw in the fraught Brexit years, conventions are flexible.
