T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. “Iran has taught Israel a lesson. ” That’s how Professor Syed Mohammad Marandi of the University of Tehran put it when I asked him what Iran achieved in its first direct strike on Israel – an unprecedented attack Israel says failed. He referred to what has long been seen as the byword for Iran’s security doctrine – “strategic patience. ” Time and again, when its assets or individuals were attacked in what were widely known to be covert Israeli operations, Iran held back or retaliated through its regional proxies. “The equation has changed,” Professor Marandi warned. “Whenever the Israeli regime touches any Iranian, the Iranians will hit back at the regime and the US and Britain who come to their aid. ”. He insisted the Nevatim air force base in southern Israel was badly damaged by Iran’s precision missiles. Israel’s account was the direct hit caused light damage and the base was still functioning. His stark warnings underline the heightened risk in this new chapter in the long-running shadow war between regional archrivals. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
