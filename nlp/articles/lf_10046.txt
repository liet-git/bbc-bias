T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. US President Joe Biden doesn't believe Iran's attack on Israel needs to escalate into a wider war, according to the National Security Council. Speaking on ABC's Meet the Press programme, John Kirby, the council's spokesman, was asked whether further escalation was likely. "The president doesn't believe it needs to move in that direction whatsoever," Kirby said, adding that Biden was working the "diplomatic side" by calling a G7 meeting later today. "What Israel demonstrated last night was an incredible ability to defend itself - just they're own military superiority was quite remarkable yesterday. "Very little got through and the damage was extraordinary light," he added. "The president has been clear we don't want this to escalate. The coming hours and days will tell us a lot.
