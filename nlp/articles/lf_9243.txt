T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. The UN’s humanitarian coordinator says there is no longer any humanitarian operation worthy of the name in southern Gaza. Speaking in Geneva, Martin Griffiths said that the pace of the military assault in the south of the Gaza Strip replicated what had been seen in the north, meaning there was no safe space for aid agencies to work. He said that while aid agencies remained in Gaza, and would not abandon its people, they had no sense of clarity, no ability to plan, and no sense of “where this will end. ”. Griffiths gave one small note of hope; he said there had been discussions with Israel about opening the Kerem Shalom crossing to allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza. But aid agencies at the moment are unable to move much beyond Rafah, and Griffiths said that any deliveries within Gaza were purely “opportunistic, erratic, undependable and unsustainable”, relying on finding, at short notice, a road that was not blocked or mined. The only serious solution, he insisted, was “to silence the guns. ”. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
