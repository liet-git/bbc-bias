Twenty-two-year-old Nagham Atef Mezied, the medical student two years out from graduation, is now telling us about how children in Gaza are faring without regular access to food, clean water or clothes: We are receiving a huge number of kids in hospitals. Some are victims of bombing of populated areas. Others are suffering as a result of hunger malnutrition and lack of basic needs. The lack of milk and formula milk is aggravating the situation. If ever available, they are highly priced. [Sometimes] ten times higher than what it used to cost before and most of parents can’t afford it. So many kids are suffering from anaemia and an iron deficiency. The lack of enough healthy food is having it’s impact on kids now, and it will have long-term impact [on] their health and growth. Also, lots of families are struggling to find nappies for the kids. They use clothes in substitution, which results in hygiene-related problems and skin irritation. The situation here is dire and even more in the north where food is not available anymore. A young girl holds her baby brother tightly outside Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al Balah.
