T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. A US warship has shot down 14 drones in the Red Sea after "a drone wave" was launched from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen, the US military has said. The US Central Command said the "one way attack drones" were downed by the USS Carney destroyer, and no ships were damaged, with no injuries reported. Meanwhile, French shipping group CMA CGM says it's pausing all container shipments through the Red Sea following attacks on commercial vessels in the area. "The situation is further deteriorating and concern of safety is increasing," the group said. A number of major freight firms have told their vessels to avoid the area, which is one of of the world's most important shipping routes. The Iran-backed Houthis have repeatedly claimed to have carried out attacks on Israeli targets since the start of the conflict in early October.    The rebels have said they will target any vessels travelling to Israel irrespective of their nationality and have claimed a series of attacks on ships in the Red Sea in recent weeks. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
