The Kuwait roundabout is almost empty of people waiting for aid trucks. Since the air strike that killed seven aid workers, the very few trucks transporting aid to northern Gaza - where residents are suffering from famine - have stopped. Three aid charity groups have stopped transporting aid in the wake of the recent raid. Osama Tawfiq, who lives in Gaza City, tells me: "The products in the market were very scarce and expensive before and are now almost unavailable. The price of a kilo of flour has increased by 100% since the aid trucks stopped. Last week I bought it for $10 (Â£8). Today it has become $20, almost not available in most stores. " Aid trucks to northern Gaza stopped after the decision of the United Arab Emirates, which was co-ordinating their arrival with Israel, to suspend its humanitarian operations following the air strike on aid workers. The suspension of work threatens to exacerbate the hunger crisis there, where residents are living in tragic, near-famine conditions. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
