T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Laura presses the foreign secretary about the UK's role in getting aid into Gaza - one idea she mentions was British troops helping get supplies from a pier built by the US onto the beaches in Gaza. Why is that not happening? "We are playing a very full part in this in moving aid from Cyprus to either Ashdod Port or onto the pier into the beach in Gaza," he says. "It will be a British Royal Navy ship - RFA Cardigan Bay - which will be the sort of logistic hub off the pier. "But the view the prime minister took was that putting British boots onto the beach is not a good move. "British boots on the ground is a risk we should not take. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
