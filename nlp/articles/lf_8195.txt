Mhairi Black, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader, answers Mitchell's comments by saying: "It makes no sense to say the situation in Gaza is too complex for a ceasefire. " "Ceasefire means stop firing. There is no middle ground, you either stop firing or you don't," she says. Black compares the 2014 conflict in Gaza, where she says that over 2,000 Palestinians were killed and the then-Prime Minister of the UK, David Cameron, called for a ceasefire. Saying there have been about 30,000 deaths in Gaza, she calls for an unconditional ceasefire. She says that Israel is not allowing aid to Gaza and that the people there are starving to death. Israel disputes this and has said in the past that it does not restrict aid going into Gaza. You can read about the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza and the logistics of getting aid in, here .
