Today's strike on Iran, which US officials have told the BBC's partner CBS News came from Israel, is an attack that is widely seen as its response to Iran's missile and drone attack on Israel. Iran's own direct attack on Israel - its first ever - was in turn retaliation for an Israeli strike on the Iranian consulate in the Syrian capital Damascus, which killed senior military commanders. Previously Israel and Iran had been engaged in a years-long shadow war - attacking each other's assets without admitting responsibility, with those attacks ratcheting up considerably during the current war in Gaza. The two countries were allies until the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran, which brought in a regime that has used opposing Israel as a key part of its ideology. Iran today does not recognise Israel's right to exist and seeks its eradication and Israel believes that Iran poses an existential threat as evidenced by Tehran's rhetoric and its build-up of proxy forces in the region including the Lebanese Shia militant group Hezbollah.
