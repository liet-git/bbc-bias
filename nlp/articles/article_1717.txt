Guernsey's government has agreed to donate £50,000 to Christian Aid to provide "lifesaving assistance" in Gaza. The Overseas Aid and Development Commission said the humanitarian donation would include the provision of water, food and winter clothes.  The commission said it was "gravely concerned" by the situation in Israel. All of the supplies will be purchased from within Gaza with £35,000 due to be spent on dry milk powder, it added. Deputy Chris Blin, president of the commission, said: "The commission does not take a political position on such matters, but what it does take is a humanitarian one.  "There is currently great hardship for Gaza's population, including children and the elderly, and the commission is pleased to make a contribution to help ease this human suffering.
