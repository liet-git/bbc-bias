T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Conservative MP Sir Bernard Jenkins is now addressing the House of Commons and says that he doesn't feel that MPs "resolved anything" relating to Gaza and Israel during yesterday's events. He also encourages MPs to embrace an earlier suggestion made by the shadow leader Lucy Powell for the government to hold a debate to discuss the matters, with space for amendments from other parties, and this would "draw a line" under the controversy. Leader of the House of Commons, Penny Mordaunt, responds to this by saying that she will consider Sir Jenkin's suggestion and will address them with business leaders. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
