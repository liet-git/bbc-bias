As the fighting continues between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, so too does the humanitarian crisis in the Palestinian enclave. Residents from a camp in southern Khan Younis - where many Gazans were originally told to flee when moving away from fighting in the north - have been recounting their experiences to the BBC . One woman told BBC Arabic's Radio Gaza programme they have no clothes or water. "We are tired from going back and forth and moving water, it is a never-ending process," she said, adding that there's no electricity and water gets into the tents. A man described the difficulties as the weather gets worse: I no longer know what to say, we can’t deal with anything anymore, the rain reaches us and has ruined all the bakeries, food and bread. All we need is to have a normal life like other people. " And a mother said her children are "very sick", describing them as eating "like the birds" due to a lack of food. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
