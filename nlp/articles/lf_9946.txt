Here's a reminder of what Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer and other party leaders had to say in response to UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's statement in Parliament: Starmer said Iran had "left the world a more dangerous place", and that its attack "must be wholly condemned" He called on Israel to show "strength and courage to de-escalate" and warned diplomatic premises should not be attacked following the strike on Iran's consulate in Syria- widely considered to be by Israel. Starmer asked about sanctions on Iran, and called again for aid to Gaza to be "drastically scaled up", an immediate ceasefire and release of Israeli hostages. The SNP's Mhairi Black condemned Iran's actions as "a cynical attempt to exploit the suffering, pain and turmoil being experienced" by Palestinians. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said all sides need to agree to a ceasefire in Gaza, to get hostages released and to get aid in. Starmer: Iran attack leaves world more dangerous place.
