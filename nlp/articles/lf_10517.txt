The Israeli military says it has reopened the Kerem Shalom crossing - a key entry point for aid into Gaza, which was closed after Hamas fired rockets towards it on Sunday, killing four Israeli soldiers. The IDF also says the Erez crossing with northern Gaza was continuing to operate and aid is reported to be moving into the enclave there. Elsewhere, Israel says its troops have taken control of the Gaza side of Rafah crossing with Egypt. The UN says this is of particular concern because all of its fuel enters there. The UN aid agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, says it hasn't received any aid via Kerem Shalom or Rafah crossings. "We're not receiving any aid into the Gaza Strip, the Rafah crossing area has ongoing military operations - there have been continued bombardments in this area throughout the day," said Scott Anderson, senior deputy director of UNRWA affairs in Gaza. But an Israeli government spokesman insists aid is getting through Kerem Shalom. "It is open and I would ask the UN why, day in and day out, there is so much surplus on the Gaza side of Kerem Shalom that is not being distributed," Avi Hyman told a briefing. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
