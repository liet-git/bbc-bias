The besieged Al-Shifa hospital in the north of Gaza has been described as a "bloodbath" by the World Health Organization (WHO). The statement issued by the United Nations health body added that the hospital was "in need of resuscitation". The WHO said they were able to deliver some medical supplies to Al-Shifa on Saturday but said there remains "a severe shortage" of water and food. Resources at Al-Shifa have been further limited by the huge numbers of Gazans seeking refuge at the hospital the WHO said. Despite already operating at capacity, more patients have been arriving at Al-Shifa, the WHO added, "patients with trauma injuries were being sutured on the floor. . . (and) no pain management is available". Al-Shifa is the largest medical complex in Gaza and it found itself on the frontline of the Israel-Gaza war after Israeli forces insisted that Hamas were running a network of underground tunnels beneath the hospital. Tens of thousands of displaced Gazans have been sheltering at Al-Shifa hospital. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
