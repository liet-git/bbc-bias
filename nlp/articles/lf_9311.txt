Ever since the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October, and Israel's subsequent campaign of bombardment, life has been torn asunder. I'm now alone with my team in the southern city of Khan Younis while my family is in central Gaza. Khan Younis was the most secure place for the satellite truck I use to report from, with a good signal, until a few days ago. But now it is on the front line of this war. I've always been proud to be a journalist but my options are running out. Life is closing in on me. I was able to travel up to central Gaza every few days to see my family until recently. But now, the Israeli military have shut one road and the second one is very dangerous. I'm originally from the north but I fled south with my family after being ordered to do so by the Israeli army, who said the south was a "safe place". Now, Israel is warning us of a "dangerous ground operation" in Khan Younis and telling us we must move further south to Rafah, right on the border with Egypt. Despite everything that has happened to me and my family since the start of the war, this is the first time I feel completely lost. All willpower and control has been ripped from me. I'm used to keeping my family safe and secure, coming up with a plan. Now I'm torn by indecision. Should I go to Rafah, keep working and hope my family will be OK? Or should I try to get back to them, stop reporting and if it comes to the worst, at least we die together? I hope no-one else ever has to face this awful choice which is not a choice at all.
