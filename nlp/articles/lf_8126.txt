The House of Commons descended into chaos today amid wrangling over parliamentary procedure and a walkout of furious SNP MPs as well as some Tory parliamentarians. But as confusion reigned in the chamber, Labour's amendment to the SNP's motion was passed. The amendment calls for an "immediate humanitarian ceasefire" in Gaza, but does not include mention of the “collective punishment of the Palestinian people” which is a technical term amounting to a war crime and which was part of the text of the SNP motion. The Labour amendment also “condemns the terrorism of Hamas” and notes “that Israel cannot be expected to cease fighting if Hamas continues with violence”. It calls for the release of hostages and international aid to be let through to Gaza. Palestinian children gather at the site of an Israeli strike on a house in Rafah. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
