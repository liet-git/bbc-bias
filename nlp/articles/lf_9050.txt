Protesters have told us rubber bullets have been fired at them by police. We've seen several images from the ground of officers carrying what are deemed "less than lethal" weapons - but the BBC can't verify yet if rubber bullets were fired. The LAPD is yet to release any public comment on its operation at UCLA this morning, including if they have made any arrests. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
