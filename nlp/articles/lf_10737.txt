T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Mark Regev, a senior adviser to the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, says South Africa "failed to meet their objective” to force a ceasefire in the Israel-Gaza conflict. “The most important thing is that the court rejected South Africa’s astonishing, preposterous demand that Israel not be given the right to defend itself,” Regev tells the BBC. Regev says Israel hasn't indicated that it will not follow the International Court of Justice’s instructions but says it is “preposterous” and “obscene” that the convention aimed at preventing genocide is being manipulated by Hamas through South Africa. He adds that Israel’s response to the 7 October attacks has been “in coordination with international law” and questioned the Gaza death toll of nearly 26,000 - saying it comes from the Hamas-run health ministry and that the ICJ justices themselves said there was no way to verify the number. “We are sure in Israel that a large number [of people killed in Gaza] are combatants and therefore legitimate targets for Israel’s military operation”.
