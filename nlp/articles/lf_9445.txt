T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Israel's Economy Minister Nir Barkat tells the BBC it is "nonsense" to suggest that Israel deliberately targeted aid workers in the air strike that killed seven on Monday night. The founder of World Central Kitchen José Andrés says he believes the attack was no mistake. Responding to this allegation, Barkat tells the BBC's Caitriona Perry: "With all due respect, there's no way in the world that Israel would target people that come to give people aid. "That's nonsense. I'm sorry, give us a bit of a respect that we care about those people. " He says the Israeli military would "never target people like this", adding that he is sure that this was a mistake. "The Israeli army will interrogate this and give the families of the people who were killed all the details. We want to make sure it doesn't happen again," he says, adding that the strike was not intentional. "I'll tell you what is intentional. On 7 October, they [Hamas and other groups] entered the villages in Israel, they raped women and killed them while they're raping them. " "Hamas want to wipe Israel off the map. They are hiding behind the civilians," he adds. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
