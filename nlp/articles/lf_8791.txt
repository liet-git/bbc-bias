In the last few hours, there's been more reaction to a move on Friday by the US to veto a resolution at the UN Security Council, which called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. The      leader of the Palestinian Authority (PA) Mahmoud Abbas      alleged that the move made the US complicit in what he called war crimes.      (The PA governs areas of the West Bank not under Israeli control, and is      separate to the Hamas government which operates in Gaza) Iran condemned the US for its support of Israel, and warned of an "uncontrollable explosion" of the situation in the Middle East. A group of Arab nations who earlier met Americaâ€™s top diplomat      called on the US to pressurise Israel into a ceasefire, stressing the      importance of international humanitarian law. But Israel has      praised the US; an earlier statement from the foreign minister echoed the      American view that the ceasefire would have helped Hamas stay in power in      Gaza. The UK also echoed the US on Friday - saying it could not vote in favour of a resolution that does not condemn "the atrocities Hamas committed" T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
