T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. We've just got a statement from the Pulitzer Prize Board - which gives prestigious awards for journalism - on the reporting of the protests by student journalists at Columbia University: As we gather to consider the nation’s finest and most courageous journalism, the Pulitzer Prize Board would like to recognize the tireless efforts of student journalists across our nation’s college campuses, who are covering protests and unrest in the face of great personal and academic risk. We would also like to acknowledge the extraordinary real-time reporting of student journalists at Columbia University, where the Pulitzer Prizes are housed, as the New York Police Department was called onto campus on Tuesday night. In the spirit of press freedom, these students worked to document a major national news event under difficult and dangerous circumstances and at risk of arrest. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
