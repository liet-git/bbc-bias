Initially the United Arab Emirates wanted to bring their draft resolution to a vote on Sunday, but in an effort to try to avoid a US veto, it has been delayed numerous times over the last few days. Negotiations continued well into the night on Tuesday, but by then, optimism was starting to wane here at the UN. Several changes were made to the draft to accommodate the US, but ultimately Washington was said to be against the establishment of a UN mechanism to monitor aid into Gaza. Security Council members are now bracing themselves for a third US veto to block council action on the Israel-Hamas war. The United States has not publicly stated how it will vote, and neither has the UK, but the BBC understands the draft will get overwhelming support in the council. Weâ€™re likely to see a mix of frustration, regret and anger expressed in member speeches later today. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
