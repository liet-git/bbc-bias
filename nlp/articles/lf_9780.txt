Famine is imminent in northern Gaza and will occur anytime between now and May. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), the global body responsible for declaring famine says 1.1m people, half the population of Gaza, are now starving. In the worst-case scenario the rest of Gaza will also be in famine by July. The conditions for declaring a famine are strict - 20% of the population must be starving,  30% of children must be severely malnourished or wasted and the death rate from malnutrition must double - to two per 10,000 each day, four per day for children. The first two have been exceeded in northern Gaza. And the rate of mortality is rising sharply, especially for children. One in three children under the age of two in northern Gaza is acutely malnourished. Most households in the north have gone entire days and nights without food. The IPC first warned of a risk of famine in December but says that since then the situation has only worsened. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
