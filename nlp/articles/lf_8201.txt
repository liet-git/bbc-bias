Andrew Mitchell says a ceasefire will not last if hostages are still being held, “if Hamas still rain down rockets on Israel and if they maintain control of Gaza with capabilities to carry out further terrorist atrocities”. He says the priority is a “humanitarian pause” to get hostages out safely and aid into Gaza quickly. He says he wants the pause to become “a complete ceasefire without a return to fighting”. As Prime Minister Sunak had told Israel's counterpart Netanyahu last week, he adds, “we continue to support Israel's right to defend its people against Hamas’s terror”. “But we are concerned about the worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza. ”.
