Another US-based NGO, American Near East Refugee Aid (Anera), playing a key role in providing food for hungry Palestinians has said it is also freezing its operations in Gaza. Anera has been working closely with World Central Kitchen in recent months. "Anera and WCK are pausing our Gaza operations. Together, Anera and WCK provide some 2 million meals a week in Gaza,” Sean Carroll, the charity's CEO told me. "Our battered, broken hearts are with our friends at World Central Kitchen today and everyday,” he wrote earlier on X. Asked about the impact that the decision to halt food provision would have on Gazans, whom the UN says are facing a man-made famine, Caroll pointed out that: “The occupying power has an obligation under international law to provide for the people under occupation. ”.
