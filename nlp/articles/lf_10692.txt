T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. The US, Israel’s main ally, is again saying that more needs to be done to protect the population of Gaza as the Israeli military offensive against Hamas intensifies, with mounting civilian casualties and a humanitarian crisis that is quickly deteriorating. Since a temporary ceasefire expired earlier this month, the warnings from senior American officials have become louder. Days ago, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said there was still a “gap” between what the Israeli authorities were saying and what they were doing. That came after strong words from the defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, who said the killings of civilians in large numbers risked turning Israel’s tactical victory in Gaza into a strategic defeat which could drive the population into the arms of Hamas. As international pressure grows, Israel says it has taken steps to warn residents in some areas they should leave and has announced efforts to increase the amount of humanitarian aid being allowed into Gaza. Aid agencies, however, say it is still not enough, and warn that those who have not been killed by bombs may not survive hunger and diseases. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
