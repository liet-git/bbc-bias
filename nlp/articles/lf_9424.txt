T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. In Israel, this rescue is being celebrated. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been consistently urged to accept a ceasefire and hostage release deal with Hamas - a plan that has faced opposition from many in this country, including far-right members of his coalition who say military action is the only way to bring the captives back home. Todayâ€™s operation may change the calculation of a leader under mounting pressure. But the Israeli military will come under international criticism for the immense harm to civilians, in a war that has already brought so much suffering to Gaza. The information coming from Gaza is still not clear. But images show intense bombardment in the densely-populated Nuseirat refugee camp, the nearby al-Aqsa hospital overwhelmed with casualties with doctors unable to treat everyone, and many mourning the dead.
