T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. That was an interesting bit of information from national security spokesman John Kirby, who says US President Joe Biden spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in recent hours. The call occurred before Hamas said it had accepted a ceasefire proposal, though, so while Biden and Netanyahu did discuss potential hostage release deals - they may not have discussed this particular one, Kirby explains. He adds that Biden has "consistently" encouraged Netanyahu to get a hostage release deal secured during their calls. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
