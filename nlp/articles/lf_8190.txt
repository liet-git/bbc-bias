T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Allan Dorans from the SNP is talking about the risks taken by humanitarian workers, health workers and journalists in Gaza. "We owe them a debt of gratitude," he says. At least 136 staff at the UN's Palestinian refugee agency have been killed in Gaza, he says, and some 300 health workers been killed during the conflict. "Journalists too have paid a heavy price," says Dorans. At least 126 have been killed in Gaza with many others arrested, he says. Their presence in Gaza is essential for the world to be informed of horrific events taking place, "and in due course to hold those responsible to account". The US and UK have much more work to do in challenging all the participants in this conflict and protecting human rights, he says. Dorans goes on to call for an immediate and permanent ceasefire today. "I will be voting in favour of SNP motion," he concludes. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
