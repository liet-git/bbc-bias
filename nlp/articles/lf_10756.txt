Judge Joan Donoghue has delivered a bleak summary of the suffering experienced by Palestinians, and says the plight of children “is especially heart-breaking". She says some of the rights sought by South Africa on behalf of the Palestinians are “plausible”. It seems likely that she will uphold at least some of South Africa’s nine requests.
