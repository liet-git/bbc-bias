Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has described the attack by the Israeli military on the World Central Kitchen team, which killed seven aid workers, as tragic but unintentional. “It happens in war,” he said. But the country’s military face some very difficult questions. The World Central Kitchen team was travelling at night in a clearly marked convoy of three cars, on a coastal road in central Gaza. The organisation said the group had left a warehouse after unloading 100 tonnes of humanitarian aid, and that its movements had been co-ordinated with the Israeli military, precisely to prevent something like what happened: being hit by the Israeli military. The three cars were hit separately, for reasons that remain unclear. How did an attack like this get carried out? The air strike has sparked disbelief and anger among other aid organisations and countries whose citizens were among the victims, including the UK, Australia, Poland, Canada and the US, which is Israel’s closest ally. The Israeli government is already under increasing international pressure because of the way it is conducting its war against Hamas in Gaza, where more than 32,000 Palestinians have been killed and a humanitarian crisis only gets worse. This incident will add even more pressure on the country. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
