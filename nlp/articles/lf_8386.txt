Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has just published a statement seemingly ruling out the possibility of an immediate ceasefire in Gaza "before the elimination of Hamas". In a post on social media, he says anyone who thinks Israel will stop the war before achieving its goals is "not connected to reality". "We won't stop fighting until we've achieved all the objectives we've set ourselves: the elimination of Hamas, the release of our hostages and the end of the threat from Gaza," he reiterates in the statement.
