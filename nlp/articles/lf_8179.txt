We're now hearing from Andrew Gwynne from Labour, who says he'll be voting for an immediate ceasefire tonight, "because the fighting needs to stop, and it needs to stop now". Words matter, he says, "and it matters that we call for a ceasefire, not a unilateral ceasefire, but a ceasefire of both sides". His comments are receiving quite a lot of interjection from the house but he pushes on. He's now taking aim at the SNP motion and listing things he says are missing from it. These include aid, a peace process, tackling wrongdoing in the West Bank, a Palestinian state, according to him. He's interrupted by an independent MP Angus MacNeil, who says: "Don't be so silly man, you know exactly what this is about, this is about stopping the killing now. " The pair have a to-and-fro before Gwynne resumes. "Enough is enough, let peace prevail, and let's have a ceasefire now. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
