As our correspondent Hugo just mentioned, the UN Security Council yesterday held a vote on a resolution that called for an immediate ceasefire in the Gaza Strip. Before the vote – the draft of which was prepared by the United Arab Emirates and co-sponsored by 97 member nations – the UN chief António Guterres said the people of Gaza were “looking into the abyss”. In the ballot, 13 members voted for the resolution , while the United Kingdom abstained . The United States was the only member to reject the resolution , using its status as a permanent member to invoke a veto. Speaking after the vote, the US said that “nearly all of our recommendations were ignored”. The UK, its key ally, said the resolution “not condemn the atrocities Hamas committed” against Israelis on 7 October. The US was criticised by countries including China and Russia , while the State of Palestine - which has permanent UN observer status - called the resolution defeat “a turning point in history”, adding that “hundreds of people will be killed by this time tomorrow”. Other countries on the council this year - which rotates among 10 non-permanent members - include Brazil, Japan and Switzerland. Israel is not currently a member. UN boss António Guterres said the people of Gaza were “looking into the abyss”. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
