T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Beirut airport reopened this morning and flights in and out of the Lebanese capital have resumed. This comes after a very tense night during which one major question here was: will Hezbollah be taking part in the Iranian retaliation against Israel? It soon became clear it wasn’t. The fear was that Israel could use that to intensify its shelling of southern Lebanon and beyond. On the open front in between southern Lebanon and northern Israel, the tit-for-tat between the Israeli army and Hezbollah continues. Hostilities between the two have been ongoing for over six months now. On the day after the Iranian attack, everyone in Lebanon remains watching closely for Israel’s response, as earlier, a leader of Hezbollah had warned that this “could usher a new stage in the conflict”.
