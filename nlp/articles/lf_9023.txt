Our colleagues on the BBC News channel have just spoken to UCLA student Kenza who has been involved in the protests on campus, which she described as being "like a war scene". "All we were doing was shining a light on the voices of Palestinians that have been overheard for 75 years," she says. Speaking after Biden's speech a few moments ago, she says the encampment at the university was "completely peaceful". "It's absolutely ridiculous that we would be deemed as a threat to civil society when the reality is we have been harassed for the past week, we have been attacked multiple times. " Kenza is a student at UCLA. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
