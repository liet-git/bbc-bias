British Palestinian doctor, Dr Salim Ghayyda, has 25 family members trapped Rafah, where Israeli strikes killed dozens overnight. He tells the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that his relatives are sharing a small flat with 25 others, including children. The 50 people in the flat all sleep on the floor, kept awake at night by the sounds of bombs exploding. His brother is a nurse and has tried to turn the flat into a makeshift health facility as all the other clinics have been "dismantled and destroyed", he says. Ghayyda, a consultant paediatrician in Inverness, says the situation is "unbearable" for him as he worries for his family, including a nephew with cancer. He has no idea whether his cancer is spreading or not. One of my nephews is autistic, so imagine the meltdown he goes into every time he hears the noises around him. There is nothing in their life at the moment that you could consider a life. Water is contaminated, they have one meal a day, they have all become malnourished - especially the children. They have got no idea what time of the day they are going to be killed. It's unbearable to be honest. Dr Ghayyda, pictured with his niece and nephew. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
