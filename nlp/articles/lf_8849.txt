T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Israel's prime minister has dismissed a plan that could see Hamas serving as a partner in governing Gaza, after the war. As we mentioned earlier, Bloomberg News reported that the Palestinian Authority is working with US officials over who will run Gaza post-war. Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammed Shtayyeh says the preferred outcome would be for the Hamas militant group to become a junior partner under the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO). Shtayyeh also suggested that Israel's aim to fully defeat Hamas is unrealistic. However, The Times of Israel reports that Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement that "there will not be a Hamas, we will eliminate it," and "the the fact that this is the Palestinian Authorityâ€™s proposal only strengthens my policy - the Palestinian Authority is not the solution.
