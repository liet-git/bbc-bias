In his first reaction after today's confusion in the Commons, Sir Keir Starmer has accused the Tories and the SNP of "choosing political games over serious solutions". "Today was a chance for Parliament to unite and speak with one voice on the horrendous situation in Gaza and Israel. It was in that spirit that Labour put forward an amendment calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire," the Labour leader said in a statement. He called it a "serious plan" for an incredibly serious situation. "Unfortunately, the Conservatives and the SNP decided to walk out hand-in-hand, refusing to vote on this serious matter, yet again choosing political games over serious solutions," Starmer adds. Both SNP and Tory MPs exited the Chamber in protest over the vote on the Labour amendment, which passed went through "on the nod", which means without division for the amendment to be voted on. Starmer said that it is clear that "only Labour that will put country over party and silly political games in order to deliver. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
