T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Displaced Palestinians in Rafah have been sharing their reactions to the call from Israel to evacuate eastern parts of the city. These are some of the people in Rafah facing a desperate situation following Israel's order: The Israeli occupation told people to go to Rafah and that it is a safe area. Today, they're telling us to get out of Rafah. Where will the people go? Should they go to the sea? Where will people go after they told us that this is a safe area. " Abu Ahmed. We have been awake since 2am because of the bombardment, and we woke up in the morning to find rain pouring, we drowned in the rain, our clothes and items as well - we are out on the streets. We also woke up to much worse news, the call to evacuate Rafah. I call on the whole Arab world to interfere for a ceasefire - let them interfere and save us from what we are in. We are tired and over this. " Aminah Adwan. It has been raining heavily and we don't know where to go. I have been worried that this day may come, I have now to see where I can take my family.
