Antonio Guterres says "we are at a breaking point in Gaza” as a “humanitarian nightmare has engulfed the people of Gaza”. He says that there is a risk of complete breakdown of public order and total collapse of the humanitarian support system in Gaza, and that’s why he used UN Article 99 to initiate today's vote. He also warns about the pressure for mass displacement into Egypt, and says the war in Gaza is a risk to international security and peace. “The threat to the safety and security of United Nations staff in Gaza is unprecedented. More than 130 of my colleagues have already been killed, many with their families,” Guterres says, adding that this is the largest single loss of life in the history of the Organisation.
