As we've mentioned, Israel's war cabinet met to discuss its response to Iran's attack. Here's a summary of what else happened yesterday: Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said his country's attack amounted to "exercising the right of legitimate defence" and said it would not hesitate to protect its interests in the future. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak called on all sides to "show restraint", with a number of other world leaders also urging against escalation. Both the White House and UK Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron described Iranâ€™s attack as a failure. Belgium, France and Germany are among several countries that summoned Iranian ambassadors , adding to growing condemnation and mounting international pressure on Tehran. US National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby claimed the amount of aid getting into Gaza had increased "quite dramatically" in recent days. But many Gazans are still displaced by fighting and unable to return home , with aid agencies warning that famine is imminent. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
