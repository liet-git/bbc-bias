T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. A former US State Department official, who quit the government over the US policy on the war in Gaza, says the UN resolution will be a source of "relief" for Secretary of State Antony Blinken and UN Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield. "But it won't be a relief for the Palestinian people," Josh Paul adds, saying the agreement does not provide much in the way of help for them. "The great success here was that the US didn't block it, not that the US supported this resolution that doesn't even call for a ceasefire," the former official tells the BBC News channel. Asked why he thought the US position had changed from vetoing a previous resolution to abstaining today, he says the US is "increasingly isolated on the world stage" and was trying get to a position of avoiding having to block the resolution. Paul accuses the US government of making a decision to "tether itself to Benjamin Netanyahu and let him drive us all off the cliff", adding the result has been a "disaster for US foreign policy" - particularly in terms of its relationships with countries in the Middle East.
