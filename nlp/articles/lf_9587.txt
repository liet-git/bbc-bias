Israel's government reacted quickly to the Norwegian and Irish announcements by recalling its envoys to Oslo and Dublin, and Norway's government will have anticipated that. Oslo's statement twice argues that it is seeking to promote "moderate forces" on both sides in a bid to revive a moribund peace process. There is no love lost between Jonas Gahr Store's centre-left government and the Israeli government. The Norwegians are highly critical of Israel's settlement policy in the West Bank, and they recognise their peace strategy since the 1993 Oslo Accord has failed. But Oslo is at pains to condemn the "terrorism and violence from Hamas and other militant [Palestinian] groups" and it talks of a path towards "demobilisation of Hamas" and providing Israel with security guarantees. Norway has been working with Saudi Arabia in particular towards a broader peace deal and stresses its decision on recognising a Palestinian state is firmly in that context. For Israel, normalisation of relations with Saudi Arabia was an aspiration that appeared to be on the horizon before the Hamas attacks of 7 October. Oslo wants to make the point here that that kind of prize should be part of a two-state solution. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
