"It's everything we feared," James Elder, a spokesperson for the United Nation's Children's Fund (Unicef), says of Israel's order for 100,000 Palestinians to evacuate parts of Rafah. "You now have families who have been displaced multiple times, who have endured trauma that one can’t quite comprehend," he tells BBC Radio 4's Today programme from Geneva, Switzerland. The Israeli military earlier said evacuees would be directed to tent cities in nearby Khan Younis and al-Mawasi, where aid would be available. But Elder insists Khan Younis - previously the focus of a months-long onslaught by the Israeli army - is not an option "because it's rubble", so many civilians will choose to go further north. "But the picture there isn’t much better," with raw sewage flowing through the streets, he says. The coping capacity of sheltering Palestinians "has been smashed. They have nothing else left, and yet, here they go," Elder says. You just hope against hope. But that last hope is gone. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
