T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Monday's UN resolution came as there continues to be huge concern over the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza. Last week, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned the entire population of Gaza was experiencing "severe levels of acute food insecurity". The UN World Food Programme has also warned that, in Gaza's two northern governorates, famine is expected to set in by May unless the flow of aid into the territory is increased. Following yesterday's vote, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the resolution "must be implemented" and that "failure would be unforgivable". Earlier yesterday, the British government announced it had carried out its first airdrop of food into Gaza. It said the Royal Air Force drop included 10 tonnes of supplies: water, rice, cooking oil, flour, tinned goods and baby formula. It also repeated calls on Israel to allow more aid in via Gaza's ports and to open more land crossings into the territory. British aid is dropped from an RAF plane over Gaza on Monday. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
