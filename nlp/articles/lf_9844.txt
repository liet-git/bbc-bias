We can bring you some fresh comments from US Secretary of State Antony Blinken's meeting with Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu. The White House says the pair spoke at the Israeli War Cabinet in Tel Aviv and Blinken "reaffirmed" US support for Israel's "right to prevent the terrorist attacks" - but also stressed the importance of "avoiding further civilian harm and protecting civilian infrastructure" in Gaza. Netanyahu and Blinken discussed efforts to secure the release of all remaining hostages and getting humanitarian aid into Gaza, spokesperson Matthew Miller says. "The secretary reiterated the need to ensure lasting, sustainable peace for the Israel and the region, including by the realisation of a Palestinian state," Miller adds. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
