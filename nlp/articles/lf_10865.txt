Palestinian PM Mohammad Shtayyeh has called for countries to sanction Israel for its bombardment of Gaza. Speaking at the Doha Forum in Qatar - alongside others quoted in our recent coverage - Shtayyeh said: “Israel should not be allowed to keep violating international humanitarian law. " “Our main concern is not the day after,” he said, in comments quoted by Al-Jazeera. “It is today. We want the stop of atrocities and genocide that (are) happening today. ”. Shtayyeh also urged the UN “to say that this occupation that was started 75 years ago must end”. Shtayyeh represents the Palestinian Authority (PA) - which is separate to the Hamas government operating in Gaza. The PA governs parts of the West Bank that are not under full Israeli control.
