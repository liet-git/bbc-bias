Almost two million people in Gaza - most of the population - are reported to have fled their homes since Israel began its military operation in response to Hamas's deadly attacks of 7 October. The Strip has been under the control of Hamas since 2007 and Israel says it is trying to destroy the military and governing capabilities of the Islamist group, which is committed to the destruction of Israel. Gaza - a densely populated enclave 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide, bounded by the Mediterranean Sea on one side and fenced off from Israel and Egypt at its borders - has "simply become uninhabitable", according to United Nations officials. Israel warned civilians to evacuate the area of Gaza north of the Wadi Gaza riverbed, ahead of its invasion in the weeks after the Hamas attack. The evacuation area included Gaza City - which was the most densely populated area of the Gaza Strip. Read more: Gaza Strip in maps: How life has changed. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
