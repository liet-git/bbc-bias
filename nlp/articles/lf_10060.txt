T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. More than 300 drones and missiles from Iran, Iraq and Yemen were launched against Israel, an Israeli military spokesman says. Lt Col Peter Lerner tells BBC Radio 4's Broadcasting House programme: "I know that around 360 various different munitions, 170 explosive drones, 30 cruise missiles, 120 ballistic missiles were fired towards Israel. "The vast majority of those were intercepted". The BBC cannot independently verify those figures. Lerner says the cruise missiles and UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) were "intercepted before they reached Israel's airspace". He adds that Israel's aerial defences and support from the US, UK, France and others sent "a very strong message" to Iran. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
