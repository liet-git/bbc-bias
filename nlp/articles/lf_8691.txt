Mark Regev, an adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, says Israel is withdrawing some of its troops from Gaza because "this is a marathon not a sprint" and "we need to rest them so they can go in later". Speaking to Sky News, Regev said when he visited the parents and families of Israeli soldiers who died fighting in Gaza, the families told him "we don’t want our young boys to have died in vain. Finish the job. Never again should Hamas be able to come across our frontier like on 7 October". "When Hamas stormed our border, they beheaded, they raped, they massacred. " Regev said the war has to end with the destruction Hamas military capabilities. "Gaza should no longer be this terror enclave that threatens its neighbours," he said. If Hamas stays in power in Gaza, "you’ll see more attacks on Israel in the future. " As we've been reporting, Israel has said fighting will continue throughout 2024. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
