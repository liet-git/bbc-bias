T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Some news just reaching us from Europe - an appeals court in the Netherlands has ruled the Dutch must stop exporting F-35 fighter jet parts to Israel. A case against the Dutch government was brought by several human rights groups, including the Dutch affiliate of Oxfam, last December. They argued the transit of the F-35 parts violates the laws of war - because the Netherlands knows the fighter planes are used for attacks on the Gaza Strip. The US-owned parts are stored in a regional warehouse in Woensdrecht and shipped to several countries including Israel. Previously, a district court had ruled their export was primarily a political decision and judges shouldn't intervene. But this morning a court said in its judgement: "It is undeniable that there is a clear risk the exported F-35 parts are used in serious violations of international humanitarian law. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
