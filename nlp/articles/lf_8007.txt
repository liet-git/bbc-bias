Blinken is now asked about what the US was trying to achieve with the UN draft resolution. He says the US was trying to show a sense of urgency about getting a ceasefire done and hostages released. He adds the strong support shows the resolution is something the international community could get behind and is "evidence and demonstration of the commitment and conviction of countries around the world, notably on the Security Council". Blinken says the resolution also condemned Hamas, and says it's "unimaginable" why certain countries would not be able to do so. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
