As you will have seen from our earlier reporting, three men who had been taken to Gaza from Israel by Hamas during their 7 October attacks have been mistakenly killed by Israeli forces. Yotam Haim, 28, Samer Talalka, 22, and Alon Shamriz, 26 were all mis-identified as a "threat" by Israel's armed forces. Here is some of what we know about the three men: Yotam Haim was a musician who loved animals and cooking Italian food. He was kidnapped from Kibbutz Kfar by Hamas. Samer Talalka was an avid motorcycle enthusiast who loved to travel in the countryside and spend time with friends. He was taken by Hamas from Kibbutz Nir Am and a photograph of him being led through Gaza was widely shared on Telegram. Alon Shamriz 's family and friends described him as a lover of life and a dedicated basketball fan. He was taken from the same kibbutz as Yotam Haim during Hamas's attacks on 7 October.
