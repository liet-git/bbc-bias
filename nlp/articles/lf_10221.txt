Speaking on Thursday evening, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Daniel Hagari addresses the "unusual footage" from a mosque in Jenin in the occupied West Bank. In a statement, Hagari says Israeli soldiers are required to act professionally and "anyone who does not conduct themselves according to IDF values will face corresponding measures". The footage Hagari is referring to shows some of the IDF's soldiers singing and praying down a microphone in a mosque in Jenin. The clips, which are circulating on social media, show scenes of the mosque. In one recording, a song about banishing darkness, associated with the current Jewish festival of Hanukkah, is heard sung in Hebrew through a loudspeaker in a minaret. The person filming laughs and joins in with the song. Other clips show soldiers inside a mosque reciting a Jewish prayer down a microphone. The Palestinian foreign ministry has condemned what it calls a "mockery of [the mosque's] sanctity". It comes during an operation against militants in the city, which has so far left 11 Palestinians dead, the Palestinian health ministry says. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
