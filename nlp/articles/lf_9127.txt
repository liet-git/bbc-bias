T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. The latest statements by the powerful Lebanese armed group Hezbollah and Israel’s army have reduced fears of a further spread of the war in the Gaza Strip. The Hamas number two, Saleh al-Arouri, was killed in Beirut on Tuesday. Both armed groups are supported by Iran. After the assassination of Arouri, a speech by the Hezbollah leader on Wednesday was closely watched. Hasan Nasrallah insisted his heavily armed forces would fight to the finish if Israel chose to extend its war to Lebanon. But he made no concrete threats to act against Israel in support of Hamas. Israel’s been widely blamed for Tuesday’s killing but has neither confirmed nor denied responsibility. Asked about the Israeli military’s preparations for a potential Hezbollah response, a spokesman said the focus was on fighting Hamas. Global concerns about the regional spill over of the war in Gaza remain high. In recent weeks, the Iran-backed Houthis, who control much of Yemen, have targeted some 20 ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden with missiles or drones, claiming they were acting against those with Israeli links. At the UN Security Council, members said the attacks were illegal, threatened regional stability, freedom of navigation and global food supplies. People watch a televised speech of Hezbollah's head Hasan Nasrallah on Wednesday. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
