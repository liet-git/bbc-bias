The US State Department says the ICJ's provisional rulings are in line with Washington's view that "Israel has the right to take action to ensure the terrorist attacks of October 7 cannot be repeated, in accordance with international law". A State Department spokesperson says the US recognises that the ICJ plays a vital role in the peaceful settlement of disputes. "We continue to believe that allegations of genocide are unfounded and note the court did not make a finding about genocide or call for a ceasefire in its ruling," they say. They add that the US has consistently made clear that Israel must take all take all possible steps to "minimise civilian harm, increase the flow of humanitarian assistance, and address dehumanising rhetoric". The US is among the Israeli allies that have stopped short of calling for a ceasefire and instead have been pushing for humanitarian pauses to allow for aid to be sent into Gaza. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
