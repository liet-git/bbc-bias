Good morning and thanks for joining our live coverage of the latest in the Israel-Gaza war. An Israeli military spokesperson has called for more residents of the southern city of Rafah in the Gaza Strip to evacuate before a planned offensive. People have been told to head to an "expanded humanitarian area" as the Israel Defense Forces intensify their operations around the city, where more than a million displaced people are sheltering. The order comes hours after a US government report said Israel may have used American-supplied weapons in breach of international humanitarian law in some instances during the war in Gaza. The UN and Western powers have warned that an all-out assault could lead to mass civilian casualties and a humanitarian catastrophe. Stay with us as we will bring you all the latest from Rafah and the wider conflict on our live page, along with analysis from our correspondents on the field. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
