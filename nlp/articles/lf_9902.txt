A spokesperson for the Israeli military has been giving more details about the hostage rescue in Rafah overnight on Sunday. Israel Defense Forces spokesman Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari says the two men were freed at around 01:50 local time (23:50 GMT). In a statement, he said Fernando Simon Marman and Louis Har, aged 60 and 70 respectively, were found "deep inside Rafah. . . held in harsh conditions". They were intentionally held in the middle of a civilian neighbourhood, inside a civilian building, to try and prevent us from rescuing them. But we did. " Hagari says the pair are back in Israel where they have undergone medical examinations and been reunited  with their family. He adds that the success of the rescue mission "underscores the importance of our ground operation in Gaza, including Rafah, when conditions allow". We have a moral obligation to bring all our hostages home. And that is an obligation that we will continue doing everything in our power to fulfil. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
