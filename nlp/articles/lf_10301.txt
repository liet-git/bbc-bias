Egypt has condemned Israel's operation in Rafah, warning its takeover of the crossing point "threatens the lives of more than a million Palestinians" who depend on it for aid. It also warned Israel not do anything which might jeopardise "strenuous efforts made to reach a sustainable truce". Egypt matters because it is a mediator in attempts to get Israel and Hamas to agree to a ceasefire. Its voice also carries weight due to the fact that Egypt is the most important Arab country with which Israel has a peace agreement. Egypt is extremely wary of what happens in Gaza. It shares a border with the territory, part of Rafah lies in Egypt, and it controls its side of the Rafah crossing. Egypt's strong words towards Israel will also be in part for domestic consumption. Ordinary Egyptians feel solidarity with Palestinians - there have been angry protests against Israel since the war began - and the government does not want to be out of step with the street.
