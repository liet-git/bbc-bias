During PMQs, Stephen Flynn, the leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP) at Westminster, said "as it stands, some 60% of the buildings in Gaza are either damaged or destroyed". That figure appears to be based on analysis of damage to buildings in Gaza by two US academics. They have been studying satellite images of Gaza and focusing on changes to the height of buildings, indicating damage. Their latest assessment – as of 14 February – is that between 54.2% and 66.2% of buildings in the Gaza Strip were likely to have been damaged or destroyed by this date.
