We return to Brendan O'Hara, who says the UK, as one of Israel's closest allies, calling for an immediate ceasefire would be "enormous". He adds that it would also pose a "pivotal moment in the campaign to stop UK arms sales to Israel". O'Hara says he utterly condemns the Hamas attack, but adds the only possible solution to this crisis, and to destroying Hamas, is political rather than military. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
