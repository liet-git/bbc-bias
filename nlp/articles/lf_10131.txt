The al-Quds brigades, Islamic Jihad's military wing, published a video that purports to have Israeli national Elad Katzir speaking from captivity in Gaza. Elad Katzir, 47, was abducted from Nir Oz with his mother Hanna during the 7 October Hamas attacks. The pair were among an estimated 240 people taken hostage. Hanna was among 105 released by Hamas during a six-day ceasefire at the end of November. Prisoners of war and hostages are protected under international humanitarian law and so the BBC does not broadcast the full details of material which may have been filmed under duress. In the video, which is said to have been filmed on 5 January, the man pictured above says he has been held hostage in Gaza for three months and has been close to dying more than once. Presenting himself as Katzir, the man calls on the Israeli government to stop the war and bring him - alongside other hostages still held in Gaza - home. He also repeatedly says that he loves and misses his family dearly. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
