The US ambassador to the UN appeared to be a little too fast with her vote on the humanitarian aid resolution that was just passed by the security council. When members were asked if they were voting in favour, Linda Thomas-Greenfield immediately raised her hand into the air. Moments later she pulled it down. Then her hand was back in the air when members were asked who would abstain. The US officially abstained from voting, along with Russia. The 13 other members voted in favour of the resolution. Moment US ambassador seems to mistakenly vote in favour of Gaza resolution at UN. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
