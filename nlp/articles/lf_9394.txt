To echo today's programme, let's end our live coverage on a lighter note - with Joanna Lumley and Eurovision. Just before this week's programme wrapped up, we got to see a clip the British actress sent from her experience as the UK Jury Spokesperson for last night's song contest in Sweden. "I can't tell you how complicated it was," Lumley says. "The preparations were extreme. " Lumley says there was a three-hour rehearsal to link up with all 25 countries taking part. "You must not drink a drop because you are going to be speaking and representing your country," Lumley adds. "It has been fascinating to see the love and work of all the performers. " We've still got one more post to bring you before we end our live coverage of this week's show, so stay tuned. A little bit dull compared with Eurovision - Lumley on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg.
