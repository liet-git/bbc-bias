T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. The ground incursion into Khan Younis has entered a critical stage. During the day, Israeli artillery intensified its shelling on Jalal Street, the main road leading into the city centre. One of the paramedics working in the city in south Gaza told me: "A call came to the ambulance unit at Nasser Hospital. We went to rescue injured people in the city centre, but we were unable to get there because of the intensity of the bombing. " While the Israeli army increases its pressure on Khan Younis, the second largest city in Gaza, Palestinians continue to flee to the much smaller Rafah. The city on the border with Egypt is unable to accommodate the flood of newcomers pouring into it every day. Safaa Mahmoud told me as she was leaving Khan Younis: "My father is sick and cannot bear the cold weather. " She added: "We spent the night without shelter, water, or food. We do not have money to buy medicine for my father. We left our home in Gaza under fire to Khan Younis, and now we have to leave again to go to Rafah. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
