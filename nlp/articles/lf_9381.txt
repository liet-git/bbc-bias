Samira Noorallah, 65, is in Deir al-Balah refugee camp, central Gaza. Following the death of her husband, she tells us how she's navigating challenges: My husband died in the camp while he was suffering from the effects of a stroke. I have been awake since early. I first cleaned the laundry, but then I find it's still dirty, so I have to redo it. I try to put my energy into keeping myself busy after witnessing the pain of losing my husband. I try to distract myself with household chores, such as doing the laundry. My husband left me with a feeling of emptiness. I used to spend my days with him, helping him, feeding him. . . Today, I have no energy for anything. Later I will try to have some fun with my grandchildren. They make me forget my pain. After having a house of 300 square meters, now we live in a tent.
