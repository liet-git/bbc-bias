Qatar’s prime minister says his country will continue efforts to pressure Israel and Hamas into a truce “despite narrowing chances”. A recent week-long pause in fighting saw the release of dozens of hostages taken from Israel and Palestinian prisoners - under a deal mediated by Qatar. Speaking at the Doha Forum today, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani said the hostages were released from Gaza thanks to negotiations, not as a result of Israeli military actions. He added that mediation efforts were continuing despite continued Israeli bombardment of Gaza, which was "narrowing the window" for a successful outcome. But “we are not going to give up," al-Thani said. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
