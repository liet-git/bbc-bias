T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. An Israeli ceasefire proposal, announced to the world by an American president, came at a time when Israel’s politicians are usually silenced by the start of the Jewish Sabbath. No mention of the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. President Biden has set out a ceasefire deal that contains three phases, and which would lead to, in his words, “a cessation of hostilities, permanently". Until now the Israeli prime minister has refused to accept any proposal that agreed to the end of the war. His far-right coalition partners have also threatened to walk out, and thus bring the government down, if Netanyahu concedes to a permanent ceasefire. For its part Hamas has refused to agree to release Israeli hostages, in exchange for a ceasefire and the release of Palestinian prisoners, unless such a deal would lead to “a sustainable long period of calm”. However, Hamas yesterday appeared to reject the Israeli offer that was presented to it by Qatari mediators. This evening, a Palestinian official familiar with the negotiations who has seen the new Israeli proposal, said that the document did not include a guarantee that the war will end nor that Israeli troops would completely withdraw from Gaza.
