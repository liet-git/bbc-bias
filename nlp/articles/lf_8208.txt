Colum Eastwood, Social Democratic and Labour Party MP for Foyle in Northern Ireland, brings a moment of calm to the house. "There is more cohesion in the house today than we are actually showing the public," he begins. He says he reluctantly draws comparisons between this debate and the Northern Ireland peace process. He calls on all MPs "to support any opportunity to vote for an immediate ceasefire". But he says the peace process in Northern Ireland showed that any cessation of violence cannot immediately be guaranteed to be permanent. "You work for the ceasefire and then you work to make it permanent," he said. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
