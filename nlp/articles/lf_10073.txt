As we reported a little earlier , US President Biden has said he will convene a meeting of G7 leaders to "co-ordinate a united diplomatic response" to Iran's attack. Italy, which currently holds the rotating G7 presidency, has called for a virtual meeting to discuss the attack, according to Reuters citing sources within the prime minister's office. It is expected to take place in the early afternoon, European time. Reports in Israel suggested RAF and US warplanes helped Israel intercept incoming drones and missiles. Biden says he told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Israel had demonstrated "remarkable capacity" in defending itself against Tehran's unprecedented attacks. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
