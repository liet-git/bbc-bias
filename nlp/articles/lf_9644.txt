We're receiving conflicting reports about the current state of Israel-Hamas truce talks this morning. While Egyptian media is reporting that there's been "noticeable progress" in the discussions - taking place in Cairo - Israel has been quoted as saying something quite different. “We still don’t see a deal on the horizon,” an unnamed Israeli official is quoted as telling the Ynet news site. “The distance [between the sides] is still great and there has been nothing dramatic so far. " Similarly, Al Jazeera TV earlier quoted a Hamas source denying any progress had been made, saying the Israeli delegation “did not respond to any of Hamas’s demands”. Those demands include a permanent ceasefire, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, the return of the displaced Palestinians to their homes, and the provision of freedom of movement, shelter and aid to Palestinians - as well as a hostage-prisoner swap deal. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said over the weekend that Israel will not agree to a ceasefire until the hostages being held in Gaza are released. Sunday marked six months of the war.
