The last time there was a vote on a ceasefire in the House of Commons, a large number of Labour MPs rebelled against the party stance. The vote last November was on an SNP amendment to a government motion, calling for an end to the "collective punishment of the Palestinian people" and urging "all parties to agree to an immediate ceasefire". It was defeated by 125 votes to 294, with the 56 Labour rebels joining other opposition parties to demand a ceasefire. Jess Phillips, Afzal Khan and Yasmin Qureshi were among shadow ministers who quit their roles to back the motion from the SNP. Announcing she was quitting her role as shadow domestic violence minister, Phillips said she was voting with "my constituents, my head, and my heart". Jess Phillips quit her role in the shadow cabinet last year after defying what was then Labour's official stance and voting for a ceasefire. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
