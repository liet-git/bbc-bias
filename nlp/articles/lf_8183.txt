The SNP's Chris Law says he is just back from Cairo where aid workers told him of a "man-made humanitarian catastrophe" -  tens of thousands of innocent people killed, horrific injuries, and Gazans with "nowhere to go". Law tells MPs he is ashamed by the international community's "moral cowardice" to prevent or stop "this atrocity", leaving people in Gaza with "hope extinguished". Experienced aid workers told him they had never experienced "anything like the horrors of Gaza", he adds - while UK aid was stuck sitting in trucks by the border. How anyone could vote against an immediate ceasefire is beyond me and my constituents, Law says.
