T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Let's circle back to what's been happening on the Israel-Lebanon border, which in the last 24 hours has seen the deadliest exchange of fire since the war in Gaza began. This morning, Israeli fighter jets hit several Hezbollah targets in Wadi Saluki in southern Lebanon, its military confirmed. It also said targets in Labouneh and Taybeh were hit. Such attacks are not uncommon - since Hezbollah pledged support to Hamas and started launching rockets into Israel, the Israelis have responded with air strikes. At least 10 people, including five children, were killed in an Israeli air strike yesterday after Lebanese militant group Hezbollah killed a soldier in Israel on Tuesday. Earlier this morning, Hezbollah announced that three of its fighters had been killed. IDF chief of staff Lt Gen Herzi Halevi said the military made "great achievements striking Hezbollah in Lebanon" and will continue. "We are intensifying the strikes all the time, and Hezbollah are paying an increasingly heavy price," he said. In response, a senior Hezbollah official said Israel "will pay the price for these crimes". Rescuers work at a damaged building following an Israeli military strike in Nabatiyeh. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
