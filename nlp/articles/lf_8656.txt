Hello, we're restarting our live coverage of the war between Israel and Hamas - a day after neighbouring Lebanon accused the Israeli military of dragging it “into a new phase of [the] confrontation”. The criticism came after Hamas's deputy leader Saleh al-Arouri was killed in a blast in Lebanon's capital Beirut. Hamas condemned the death, while its ally Hezbollah said it was an assault on Lebanese sovereignty. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied involvement. Lebanese Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib told the BBC yesterday that his government was talking to Hezbollah to "impress on them that they should not respond themselves". Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron urged Israel to "avoid any escalatory attitude, particularly in Lebanon". On the ground in Gaza, intense fighting continues in the south, despite Israel announcing plans to pull back some troops. Stick with us as we bring you the latest developments from the region. This image from yesterday shows Lebanese soldiers at the site of an explosion in a district of Beirut, Lebanon, where Hamas's deputy leader was killed. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
