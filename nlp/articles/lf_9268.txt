T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. In the last week, we've seen more US leaders begin to voice disquiet with Israel's tactics. The US Secretary of State in an interview with CNN yesterday said he believed Israel was taking more steps to protect civilians in their offensive into southern Gaza. “I said to them very clearly when I was there just a week ago, we cannot have a repeat of what happened in the north in the south in terms of harm being done to civilians,” Antony Blinken told CNN. “What we’re seeing is areas clearly designated by Israel that are safe areas, where there’s not going to be firing or the military. We’ve seen efforts to make sure that people know that they need to move – and not in the entire city, but just discrete neighborhoods. So that’s positive,” Blinken said. However UN officials have consistently disputed these safe zones, saying the idea of any "safe zone" is a "dangerous false narrative". "These are tiny patches of barren land. They have no water, no facilities, no shelter from the cold, no sanitation," a Unicef spokesman James Elder told the BBC earlier this week . Other UN officials and locals have also made similar alarming calls. The UN has also said there is nowhere left for people in the South to evacuate to. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
