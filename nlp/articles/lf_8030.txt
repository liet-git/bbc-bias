When dawn broke last Monday morning, signalling the beginning of Ramadan, it brought a cruel irony for the people of Gaza. The holy month when Muslims fast during daylight had arrived amid a looming famine. Gazans had already endured five months of war. Virtually the entire population was already dependent on food aid to survive. "The people here have already been fasting for months," said Dr Amjad Eleiwa, the deputy director of the emergency department at al-Shifa hospital, Gaza City. "They scour the city looking for food to survive, but they cannot find any.
