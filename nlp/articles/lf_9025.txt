The hearing, entitled "Calling for Accountability: Stopping Anti-Semitic College Chaos", will include testimonies from university presidents from Yale, UCLA and Michigan. â€œThe Committee has a clear message for mealy-mouthed, spineless college leaders: Congress will not tolerate your dereliction of your duty to your Jewish students," Committee Chair Rep.
