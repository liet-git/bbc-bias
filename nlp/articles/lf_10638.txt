Let's have a closer look at the latest batch of US sanctions and what the implications are. US Treasury Department officials say "all property and interests in property" which are in the US will be blocked and must be reported to the Office of Foreign Assets Control. Any entities owned, directly or indirectly, by 50% or more will also be frozen - unless specific authorisation is given by the US department. This means the targeted individuals will have no access to these. The US Treasury statement adds: "In addition, non-US financial institutions and other persons that engage in certain transactions or activities with sanctioned entities and individuals may expose themselves to sanctions risk or be subject to an enforcement action". As we've been reporting, eight individuals affiliated with Hamas - a proscribed organisation in the US, UK and other countries - have been added to this latest round of sanctions. The latest round, similar to the other three, seeks to cut off funding for the militant-Palestinian group following its deadly attack on Israel on 7 October. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
