As our reporter Adnan El-Bursh, who is in Rafah at the southern edge of the Gaza Strip, reported earlier, tens of thousands of Palestinians continue to flee south from the city of Khan Younis after the Israeli army entered it and fighting intensified. Streets in Rafah are packed with newly displaced people, and ambulances are seen rushing with the wounded trying to reach hospitals through the jammed streets, as Israeli air strikes continue in the southern Gaza Strip. At least eight air strikes are reported to have hit Rafah overnight. There is no food, no electricity and serious water shortages in the city of Rafah - the UN humanitarian agency says that Rafah is the only area where very limited supplies are reaching Gazans. Most people are sleeping on the ground as the shelters are full. Rafah city, which is on the border with Egypt, has turned into a vast camp for many of the 1.9 million Palestinians who have been internally displaced - 85% of the population of Gaza. Egypt says that it will not allow Gazans to be pushed to its territory. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
