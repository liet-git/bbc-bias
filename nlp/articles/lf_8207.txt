Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran says that the headlines likely to follow today's proceedings will be about the rejection of an immediate ceasefire because of the lack of co-ordination between opposition parties. She asks David Lammy whether he agrees that "we should and could have done better". Lammy says that the whole point of the Labour amendment "is to give this house an opportunity to come together", and that her "poignant" message to the Commons a few weeks ago was the reason why now was the moment "to come together".
