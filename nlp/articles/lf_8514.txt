T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. The closure of the Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings severed access for fuel, supplies and the movement of humanitarian staff, says Georgios Petropoulos, who is the head of the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs. The shutdowns "also affected any movement of civilians who could go out on medical evacuation”, Petropoulos has said. In a video filmed on Friday but posted today on X , formerly known as Twitter, Petropoulos said the “World Food Programme (WFP) and UNRWA (United Nations Relief and Works Agency) will run out of food for distribution in the south by tomorrow,” which means they would run out of food as of today. He says this means people will be left "only with the aid that has already been distributed in their shelters, in their homes and on site". Petropoulos has also said there are only four bakeries left operating in limited capacity in south Gaza, and they will be out of stock by Monday. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
