T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. More now from the head of the UN’s agency for Palestinian refugees, who earlier described being "absolutely horrified" when he saw a video showing one of its schools being blown up in northern Gaza. “Schools, medical and UN facilities are not and should never, ever be a target. Unfortunately, in Gaza, they have quite often become just that,” UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini told reporters in Geneva. In the video, first posted online on Tuesday, Israeli soldiers can be heard cheering and clapping in the background as large explosions demolish white-and-blue school buildings in the town of Beit Hanoun. The Israeli military has not commented on the video, but on Saturday it said gunmen had shot at its troops from an UNRWA school in Beit Hanoun. Lazzarini said UNRWA had recorded 150 incidents since the beginning of the war in which its facilities were hit directly or indirectly, leading to the killing of more than 270 people. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
