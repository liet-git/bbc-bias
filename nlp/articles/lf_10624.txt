While the US and the UK have imposed additional sanctions on Hamas officials , the EU Commission President is calling for sanctions on "extremist" Israeli settlers who she says are responsible for attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank. Ursula von der Leyen says: "The rise in violence by extremist settlers is inflicting immense suffering on the Palestinians. It undermines the prospects for a lasting peace and could further exacerbate regional instability. " The UN and many countries say all Israeli settlements in the West Bank are illegal under international law. It is something many Israelis, especially those living in the settlements, vehemently dispute. The strengthening and expansion of settlements in the West Bank has been a key platform of the Netanyahu government, and is one of the most contentious issues between Israel and the Palestinians. At the beginning of the year, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken criticised Israeli settlement activity in the occupied West Bank as an obstacle to peace. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
