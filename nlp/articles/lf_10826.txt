There have been almost daily exchanges between Israel and Hezbollah, the dominant militia-cum-political movement in Lebanon, which is allied with Iran. It’s very well armed and very experienced from fighting in Syria, and an all-together different category of enemy for Israel than Hamas could be – and that is heating up. There’s also been speculation that Israel – once it’s done what it needs to do in Gaza – might move on to try and do something similar with Hezbollah. For many people in the Middle East that would be something of a nightmare scenario. There’s an element of solidarity in what Hezbollah is doing, but its leader Hassan Nasrallah has said that they’re essentially tying down Israeli troops in the north. So it’s not a symbolic, performative act. They argue that they are doing something on a lower level than full warfare, but that they are still tying down thousands of Israeli troops. There’s also an enormous amount of economic disruption in northern Israel, and many of the population from the area have been displaced from border communities and are going to live in hotels elsewhere in the country. It hasn’t been in the news in the way that Gaza has, but it’s causing a lot of damage to Israel. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
