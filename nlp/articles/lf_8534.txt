A phone call between US President Joe Biden and Israel's PM Benjamin Netanyahu was "direct" and "business-like", the White House has said. Spokesman John Kirby said the leaders listened to one another - but admitted that in the lead up, Biden had grown frustrated that messages to Netanyahu didn't seem to be getting through. A White House readout said that Biden told Netanyahu: US support for Israel will depend on steps being taken to "address civilian harm" and "humanitarian suffering" in Gaza. Strikes on humanitarian workers and the overall humanitarian situation in the Strip are unacceptable. An immediate ceasefire is essential to stabilise and improve the humanitarian situation and protect innocent. Meanwhile, here are some other developments from Gaza: No aid trucks have entered northern Gaza since the strike on Monday - Oxfam says people in the region have been forced to survive on an average of 245 calories a day, less than a can of fava beans, since January. An Israeli government spokesperson signalled the findings of an investigation into the strike could be released in the "coming weeks", but a spokesman for Cogat - the Israeli body that co-ordinates humanitarian aid to Gaza - suggested it could be days. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan joined a growing number of prominent politicians and legal experts calling on the UK government to suspend arms exports to Israel. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
