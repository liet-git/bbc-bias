One topic likely to crop up at PMQs is the test firing failure of the UK's Trident nuclear missile, which emerged last night. Defence Secretary Grant Shapps witnessed the test, in which it is reported the booster rockets failed and the missile landed in the sea close to the launch site. A defence source close to Shapps has said the failure was "specific to the event" and there is "no doubt" the UK would be able to fire "in a real world situation if we needed to". But Labour has called for assurances over the effectiveness of the nuclear deterrent with John Healey, the shadow defence secretary, branding the failure "concerning". The Ministry of Defence, meanwhile, insists the "nuclear deterrent remains safe, secure and effective". You can read our full story here . An unarmed missile being fired from HMS Vigilant in 2012.
