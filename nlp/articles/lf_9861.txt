We've just had the first updates from the meeting between Israel's President Isaac Herzog and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. On X , Herzog thanks Blinken and the US for their "unwavering support for the State of Israel". "We discussed the ongoing plight of the hostages and the need to bring them home immediately," he says. And - as we reported earlier - he also raises South Africa bringing a genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice. "We will proudly and clearly present the fundamental right of Israel to defend itself," Herzog says. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
