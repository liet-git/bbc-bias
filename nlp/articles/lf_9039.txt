It all happened swiftly towards the end, most of the encampment is now dismantled, and the last few protesters from inside are being detained and led away. There continues to be a demonstration on one side, with hundreds of police still on site. There are dozens of demonstrators here who have been detained by police, hands tied behind their backs and all sitting along on the kerbside as they are now being processed and put onto buses. As they were being led away I asked what their reaction was to the police operation. “It was expected,” one told me. Others who said they were students were asked if they thought that being detained might affect their place at the university. “We don’t know,” they replied. From the police perspective you imagine they will consider this a success as they managed to dismantle the encampment fairly systematically, with protesters significantly outnumbered each time police made a move to corral them back.
