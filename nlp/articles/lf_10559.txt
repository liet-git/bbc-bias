Welcome to our live coverage of the war in Gaza. Heavy shelling has been reported in the southern Gaza city of Rafah, after Joe Biden warned Israel against a major ground offensive there. "If they go into Rafah, I'm not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah," the US president told CNN. "We're not going to supply the weapons and artillery shells," he added. Rafah - on the southern edge of the strip - is densely populated, after hundreds of thousands of Palestinians fled there from other parts of Gaza.
