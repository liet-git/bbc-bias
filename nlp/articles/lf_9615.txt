Benjamin Netanyahu says a date has been set for an Israeli offensive in Rafah, according to Reuters news agency. The Israeli prime minister did not say when the invasion would take place. "Today I received a detailed report on the talks in Cairo, we are constantly working to achieve our goals, first and foremost the release of all our hostages and achieving a complete victory over Hamas," Netanyahu said. "This victory requires entry into Rafah and the elimination of the terrorist battalions there. It will happen - there is a date," Netanyahu added. The Israeli military previously told people from everywhere else in Gaza to evacuate to Rafah, which is on the border with Egypt, declaring it a safe zone. Pressure has been growing on Israeli from the international community and the United States not to invade the city without a specific plan as to how to keep the civilians there safe. 600,000 children are currently sheltering in Rafah.
