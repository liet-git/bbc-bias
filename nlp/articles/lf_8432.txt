It's a very explicit call from David Cameron and Annalena Baerbock, both writing in major news papers to call for a ceasefire. Franceâ€™s Foreign Minister, visiting Israel today, has also called for an immediate ceasefire. This is slightly semantics about what is the difference between an immediate ceasefire and sustainable ceasefire. But the fact is that I don't think any of Israel's allies, which include Britain, the US and Germany, envisaged this when on 7 October they pledged their full support for Israel and its right to defend itself. I don't think any of them envisaged a death toll of approaching 20,000 people in Gaza. So there is a real momentum internationally to curtail Israel's military operation. Not to stop it all together but at least to reduce the amount of suffering and deaths on the part of the Palestinians. There are also questions being asked internationally about the discipline and rules of engagement of the Israeli forces. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
