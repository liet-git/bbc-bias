T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Israel says it will reopen one of its main Gaza crossing points for the inspection of aid trucks, within the coming few days. The Kerem Shalom crossing has been closed since 7 October. All trucks carrying aid destined for Gaza are currently inspected by Israeli officials at Nitzana, 25 miles south along the Egyptian-Israeli border. Inspected trucks then travel to Rafah, where they enter Gaza. Israel says there’s nothing wrong with the process, which it says is capable of handling up to 200 trucks a day. Col Elad Goren, Head of the Civil Department of the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) told journalists the problem was one of logistics and the capacity of aid agencies to deal with sufficient volumes of aid. But Kerem Shalom, he said, would be needed if the agencies wanted to process more than 200 trucks a day. Speaking in Geneva, the UN’s top aid official, Martin Griffiths, said there were “promising signs” that Kerem Shalom might soon be open. But Col Goren indicated that the facility would only function as an additional inspection facility, not as entry point into Gaza. Israel has banned all aid from crossing directly into Gaza since 7 October. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
