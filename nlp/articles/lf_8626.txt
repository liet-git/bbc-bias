Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian criticises Israel for its "cowardly terrorist operations" in a post on X. Broadcast and print media in Iran are also covering the story widely, reporting on the "martyrdom" of al-Arouri and Israel's "desperation", which they say forced it to carry out the strike. The Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) in a statement "strongly condemned" the killing, saying it would boost the "Palestinian fighters's conviction" in their fight against "occupiers". The IRGC also describes the strike as a "violation of Lebanon's sovereignty". T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
