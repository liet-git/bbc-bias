Conservative MP Alicia Kearns asks the prime minister whether he will commit to launch "a new consensus on Iran with our allies, and a new effort with combined diplomatic, military and wider expert areas to limit the extent of the atrocities of Iran". She tells Sunak that we must deal with threats from Iran as one. Sunak replies that he can give that commitment and it was the subject of discussions yesterday among other G7 leaders. He says Iran's nuclear programme has "never been more advanced" than it is today. The UK is committed to using all diplomatic tools available, Sunak adds, to ensure that Iran never develops a nuclear weapon. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
