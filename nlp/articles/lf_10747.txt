 F-N-S-T-A-R-T. 10747 F-N-E-N-D.  D-A-T-E-S-T-A-R-T. 2024-01-26 D-A-T-E-E-N-D.  T-I-T-L-E-S-T-A-R-T. Court stops short of requesting immediate ceasefire. T-I-T-L-E-E-N-D.  T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. The court did not agree to South Africa’s request for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza – something that will disappoint the South Africans and Palestinians alike. But by large majorities the court’s 17 judges ruled, among other measures, that Israel should do everything in its power to avoid killing Palestinians, causing them serious bodily or mental harm or imposing measures intended to prevent Palestinian women from giving birth. This is not the court’s final ruling on genocide – that’s likely to take several years. But the measures called for today are designed to make sure that while the judges consider South Africa’s fundamental charge against Israel, the Palestinians of Gaza enjoy some measure of protection. Israel must now decide how to respond. The ICJ’s rulings are binding, but there’s no enforcement mechanism. Israel could choose to ignore the judges altogether. But with diplomatic efforts now apparently concentrating on the possibility of a two-month ceasefire, and efforts still being made to improve the flow of aid into the Gaza Strip, Israel may argue that it’s already taking steps to meet the court’s demands.
