It comes as top US diplomat Antony Blinken is on a visit to Israel as part of his efforts to secure a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of Israeli hostages, amid fraying US-Israel ties. Blinken was pictured shaking hands with Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu , and is scheduled to meet other members of the Israeli government. A UN-backed food security assessment this week said 1.1 million people in Gaza were struggling with catastrophic hunger and starvation.

Top US diplomat Antony Blinken is in Israel to try to ensure the release of Israeli hostages and broker a ceasefire in Gaza. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
