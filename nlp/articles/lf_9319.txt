We’ve just been speaking to Muhammad Mahmoud Kafina in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, who says he “will not move” again. Muhammad, 76, arrived in Khan Younis three weeks ago, after his home in Gaza City was destroyed in bombing. “The road was very hard on that day, very harsh. We were holding up our IDs and walking… I was walking with my head down and kept on reciting the Quran,” he recalls. Muhammad describes the current situation in Khan Younis as “very hard” but says it is “much better than Gaza City where we were facing death every hour”. “There is constant bombing on Khan Younis but it is not as strong as it was in Gaza City - it does not reach the strength of destruction,” he says, adding that he has not yet seen any Israeli tanks or troops. “For myself, I do not want to get displaced again but my wife keeps on telling me ‘lets get out of here’, but I say that I will not go. . . I will not move at all. ”. There has been fierce fighting in Khan Younis, with the Israeli military on Tuesday saying they had reached the heart of the city. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
