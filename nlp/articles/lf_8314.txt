T-I-T-L-E-E-N-D.  T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. The UN special expert on the Occupied Territories says there are reasonable grounds to believe Israel has committed "acts of genocide" in Gaza. Francesca Albanese is an independent expert appointed by the UN to monitor human rights in the region, and has long been outspoken about what she views as Israeli violations. Israel has already issued a statement condemning her report as ‘an outrageous distortion’ of the Genocide Convention. Albanese will present her report to the UN Human Rights Council this afternoon, where Israel has a formal right of response, and Palestinian human rights defenders and families of Israeli hostages are also expected to speak.
