A former US senior national security adviser has told the BBC that she expects Israel will be going after Hamas's top leaders for years to come. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programe, Mara Rudman says the strike in Beirut which killed Saleh al-Arouri, was part of a wider plan to eliminate those responsible for the 7 October massacre in Israel. She compares it to the tracking down of those who carried out the Munich Olympics terror attacks in 1972 saying: "It's not about location, but about individuals. " Rudman said she didn't believe "the strike alone would be a source of escalation," as there have been ongoing tensions between Hezbollah and Israel for some time. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
