T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Since the start of the Hamas-Israel war in October, Hezbollah - the powerful Lebanese Shia group - and the Israeli military have exchanged attacks almost every day but, so far, the violence has been largely contained to the border area. Tuesday’s attack that killed the deputy chief of Hamas was the first to hit Beirut, striking the southern suburb of Dahiyeh, a Hezbollah stronghold. It was a blow to Hamas and probably a message to Hezbollah. Israeli officials have warned the group against escalating the conflict, with some saying the army could do to Beirut what it has done to Gaza. Many here still remember the devastation caused by the month-long war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006. Those memories and Lebanon’s severe economic crisis mean there is virtually no public support for any military confrontation. Both Hezbollah and Hamas are part of the so-called Axis of Resistance, an alliance of factions across the region backed by Iran. Hezbollah is its main force, and seen by Israel as a much more formidable foe than Hamas. It has a vast arsenal of weapons that includes precision-guided missiles that can strike deep into Israeli territory, and tens of thousands of well-trained, battle-hardened fighters. The Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, is keen to show his group is supporting its ally Hamas in the war in Gaza. Up until now, however, he has calculated the actions to prevent a full-scale war with Israel. Miscalculation, however, is always a risk.
