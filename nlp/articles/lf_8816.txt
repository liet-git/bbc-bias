The Israeli military’s offensive against Hamas in Gaza continues with full force - despite growing pressure for more to be done to minimise civilian casualties, which continue to mount. In the north, residents reported renewed Israeli tank fire, while in the south, intense fighting continues. Khan Younis - where Yahya Sinwar, the Hamas leader in Gaza, is from - remains a key target. The Israeli authorities say the group’s leaders are hiding there, possibly in the underground network of tunnels. Fighting in the city was happening house to house and "shaft to shaft", Brig Gen Dan Goldfuss told the Reuters news agency, a reference to tunnel shafts. Last night, the armed wing of Hamas released a video which it says shows the aftermath of a failed Israeli operation to free a hostage. It ends with images of a bloodied body that appears to be of the captive. The video has not been independently verified. A spokesman for the Israeli military said a representative had informed the hostage’s family, and said Hamas was waging “psychological warfare”. Earlier, Israeli military confirmed that two soldiers had been seriously wounded during operations in Gaza to release hostages but that no-one had been freed. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
