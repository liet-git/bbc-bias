As we've just reported, Israel will investigate the killing of seven aid workers in an Israeli air strike in Gaza and it will be handled through a special military body set up to examine exceptional incidents. The so-called Fact Finding Assessment Mechanism (FFA) compiles evidence, which is used by the Military Advocate General (MAG) in deciding whether or not to open a criminal investigation. If the MAG suspects a crime might have been committed, the case will be passed to the Military Police to formally investigate. Israeli media say the results of a separate, initial probe will be presented to the head of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), Lt Gen Herzi Halevi, on Tuesday night and shared with the countries where the victims came from. Since the start of the war in October, the FFA has opened investigations into several incidents. These include the killings of more than 100 Palestinians (according to the Hamas-run health ministry) during an aid convoy disaster in February; the death of six-year-old Palestinian girl Hind Rajab and five members of her family, also in February; and possible friendly-fire deaths of Israelis when IDF forces opened fire where Hamas gunmen had taken people hostage in Israel on 7 October. The MAG Corps says since the beginning of the current conflict, the MAG has ordered the opening of criminal investigations in a number of incidents "that raised suspicion of detainee mistreatment, deaths of detainees, pillaging, and the illegal use of force". It says those investigations are ongoing. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
