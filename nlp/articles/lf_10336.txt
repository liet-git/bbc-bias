A Hamas deputy leader in Gaza told the Reuters news agency that the ceasefire terms it agreed to on Monday included an Israeli-Palestinian prisoner swap over three phases. The BBC cannot independently verify the information at this point, but here are the details: Phase one: Would involve a 42-day ceasefire period where Hamas releases 33 hostages in return for the release of Palestinian prioners from Israeli jails. It would also involve Israel partially withdrawing troops from Gaza and allowing Palestinians to move freely from the south to north. Phase two: Involves another 42-day ceasefire period in which a "sustainable calm" would be restored to Gaza and Israeli troops would completely withdraw. Hamas would also be expected to release Israeli reservists and some soldiers being held hostage in return for the release of Palestinian prisoners from jail. Phrase three: Would see the exchanging of bodies completed and the starting of reconstruction according to a plan overseen by Qatar, Egypt and the United Nations. It would also see the end of the Gaza Strip's complete blockade. As we've been reporting, the exact details of the proposal agreed by Hamas are still unclear and Israeli's Netanyahu has said that the agreement was "far from meeting Israel's demands", adding that he would send a team to Cairo to negotiate further.
