BBC Verify is checking footage posted to Palestinian social media channels showing signs of strikes in parts of Rafah. On Monday, footage emerged of two people lying motionless on the street around 50 metres from the city's Kuwaiti hospital. Media reports say that two people were killed in a drone strike at this spot. We were able to identify the location using landmarks such as a minaret belonging to a mosque directly adjacent the hospital building. But we are yet to verify the cause of the incident. Another clip posted overnight shows a small column of smoke rising from the Indonesian field hospital - a distinctive building located around a mile away from the site of Sunday nightâ€™s refugee camp strike. In a nearby area of the city, we have also seen smoke rising close to the Taiba mosque  - identifiable by distinctive twin minarets. There are also clips of people being brought into hospitals. We will continue to review footage to gain a better understanding of the situation in Rafah. The Taiba mosque with distinctive twin minarets. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
