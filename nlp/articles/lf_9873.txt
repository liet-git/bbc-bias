The UAE ambassador to the UN has said her country is "extremely worried" about the situation in Rafah. Speaking at an event in Dubai, Lana Nusseibeh said "any military operation in Rafah would have unacceptable consequences". Nusseibeh has called for a two-state solution, arguing that it is critical for the reconstruction of Gaza. "You cannot deny the Palestinian right to statehood - and that is an Arab consensus," she said. The United Arab Emirates and Israel established diplomatic ties in 2020, making it one of the few Arab countries to recognise Israel. Despite maintaining those ties since the Israel-Hamas war began in October, the UAE has expressed strong solidarity with the Palestinians as the conflict continues.
