UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has described a new report on the level of hunger in Gaza as an "appalling indictment of the conditions on the ground". Earlier, we reported the findings of the report from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), the global body responsible for declaring famine. It said more than half of all Palestinians in Gaza - 1.1 million people - have completely exhausted their food supplies and are facing catastrophic hunger. "This is the highest number of people facing catastrophic hunger ever recorded by IPC system anywhere - anytime," Guterres says. "This is an entirely manmade disaster and the report makes clear that it can be halted. Today's report is exhibit A for the need for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
