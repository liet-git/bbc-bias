There will be a meeting of the UN's Security council in New York this evening, which diplomats have said will discuss attacks on shipping in the Red Sea by Houthi rebels from Yemen. On Tuesday, US Central Command (Centcom) says Houthi forces fired two anti-ship ballistic missiles and multiple commercial ships reported impact in surrounding water. No damage has been reported. This followed US Navy helicopters sinking Houthi boats it says shot at and were attempting to board a Danish-owned vessel on Sunday. Missile and drone attacks on commercial vessels have been ongoing from Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen since mid-November, attacking ships passing through the nearby Bab al-Mandab strait. In response, the US government set up an international coalition in December to protect the vital sea lane - which links markets in Asia with Europe via the Suez Canal in Egypt and is also a key route for fuel shipments from the Gulf. Shipping firms have been re-routing around the horn of Africa as a safety precaution, but analysts and businesses have warned this far-longer journey will lead to rising prices for a variety of goods . The Iranian-backed militia is an ally of Hamas and claims it is attacking "Israel-linked" ships in the Red Sea in response to the war in Gaza. A Houthi spokesman says they targeted a French vessel heading for Israel on Tuesday. Who are the Houthi rebels? T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
