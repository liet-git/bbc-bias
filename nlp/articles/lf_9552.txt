If an Israeli air strike was responsible for taking the lives of seven World Central Kitchen (WCK) aid workers - and the evidence available so far points in that direction - then this is a disaster: for WCK, the people of Gaza, and Israel’s image. As Israel moves to ban UNRWA - the main UN organisation responsible for the Welfare of Palestinian (UNWRA) in the Gaza Strip - it has come to rely heavily on other humanitarian organisations. The government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has accused UNWRA of employing more than 2,000 members of Hamas. WCK, which has been on the ground for months and which had just brought in a second 400 tonne shipment of aid by sea from Cyprus, is playing an increasingly prominent and important role in preventing Gaza from sliding into famine. Israel has trumpeted the role of WCK and other aid organisations as proof UNRWA is no longer needed. At a recent briefing, Israeli diplomats said WCK had “come out of nowhere and has become around 13% of the food story inside Gaza". It also says it is doing everything in its power to facilitate the distribution of aid throughout the Gaza Strip. Last night’s deadly attack on the WCK convoy will make it harder for Israel to sustain that narrative. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
