We have been reporting on Israeli special forces entering the Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, the main medical complex in southern Gaza. The Reuters news agency has spoken to people who were inside the hospital when the raid started. Rasmeya Saleem Abu Jamoos had been receiving treatment and says Israeli forces detained her blind husband. "I left with my husband. . . I was doing kidney dialysis. They destroyed the wall by us, as well as [a] doctor's room," she says. "They ordered us to leave and fired at us, they fired bombs and rockets on our heads from the top. They demolished the building. We left through the door and we walked in the sewage," she says, adding that her husband was then detained. Hanna Um Mahmoud had been receiving treatment at the hospital for almost three weeks when the raid started. "Only those who cannot walk were allowed to stay. We all evacuated and we walked on foot from the Nasser hospital to al-Miraj in Rafah. "The roads are not paved, we are tired and humiliated. Only God knows what we saw on this journey.
