Israeli forces say they're now "in the heart" of the southern city of Khan Younis, where it’s thought Hamas leaders could be hiding. They say they’re also engaged in intense firefights in the north of the territory and there’s been continuing fierce bombardment including of areas where Palestinians have been told to seek safety. The UN says that more than 80% of people in Gaza have now been driven from their homes and that fighting is preventing aid from being distributed outside a small corner of the territory. With American officials starting to voice disquiet about the human cost of the war, the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said last night, the only way to finish it quickly was to use crushing force against Hamas. Earlier, his war cabinet also came under attack at a meeting with families of the remaining 138 hostages in Gaza. There were angry outbursts from some relatives who believe there’s no immediate plan to rescue their loved ones. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
