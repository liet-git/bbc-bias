We're going to pause our live coverage now, after the International Criminal Court's (ICC) chief prosecutor announced he was seeking arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Hamas's leader in Gaza Yahya Sinwar, and others. While some have rallied behind the decision, many global leaders, including those in the US, have voiced their criticism. Here's a look back at what happened today: Karim Khan , the ICC prosecutor, said he has "reasonable ground to believe" Netanyahu and Sinwar bear responsibility for war crimes and crimes against humanity. The ICC is also seeking warrants for Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant and Hamas leaders Ismail Haniyeh and Mohammed al-Masri. US President Joe Biden described the move as "outrageous" and said there was "no equivalence between Israel and Hamas" Secretary of State Antony Blinken echoed those sentiments saying the US "fundamentally rejected" the decision and claimed the ICC had no jurisdiction over the matter. In a quick response to the US criticism, the ICC released a statement saying there was no information that demonstrated "genuine action at the domestic level [in Israel] to address the crimes alleged or the individuals under investigation" Meanwhile, some groups expressed support for the decision, including Human Rights Watch , a non-governmental organisation, which described Khan's move to seek arrest warrants as a "principled first step" Earlier Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said the ICC's decision was a "historical disgrace that will be remembered forever" While Sami Abu Suhri , a senior Hamas official, said the move "equates the victim with the executioner" T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
