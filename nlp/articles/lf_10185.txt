Israel is to allow aid to pass through the Kerem Shalom checkpoint into Gaza for the first time since the war began on 7 October. The Israeli prime minister's office said the opening would enable Israel to maintain its commitments to allow 200 lorries of aid to enter per day, which was agreed upon in a hostage deal last month. Israel had previously insisted that no Israeli border crossings into Gaza would be opened until all hostages held by Hamas were released. Until now aid has only been able to enter Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt â€“ which can only process a limited number of vehicles. The US praised the move and White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan called it a "significant step". It marks a change from Israel's stance last week, when Israel said the Kerem Shalom crossing would only open for the inspection of aid lorries before the trucks would go to Rafah to cross into Gaza.
