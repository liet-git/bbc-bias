The former CEO of World Central Kitchen (WCK) has paid tribute to Lalzawmi "Zomi" Frankcom, the Australian national who was killed in Monday's strike. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's World At One programme, Nate Mook described how Frankcom was one of the charity's earliest employees and had a "tremendous warm energy". "Whatever needed to be done, she was always willing to jump in," he says. “I think what was so special about her is, when she was out in the field, working with people in their darkest moments, she just had this way to comfort people. "She would sit down, hold their hand. She was just so warm. ”. He adds that he believes there were "choices being made that are making it nearly impossible" for aid organisations, such as WCK, to continue safely operating in Gaza. "This needs to be a breaking moment where things change. ”. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
