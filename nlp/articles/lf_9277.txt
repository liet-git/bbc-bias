The producers of the Israeli Nova music festival have created an exhibition in Tel Aviv to remember the more than 360 people who were killed when Hamas gunmen attacked the festival on 7 October. Forty others were taken hostage. According to Reuteres news agency, organisers have used original equipment from the festival, which took place in southern Israel, to reconstruct it. Burnt-out cars from the festival appear in the exhibition. As does a tent, chairs and a board game used by festival-goers. Bullet-ridden toilet cabins from the festival grounds are also among exhibits. Photographs of dozens of those taken hostage during the attack have been put together in a composition. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
