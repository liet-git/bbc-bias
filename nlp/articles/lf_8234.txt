T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Labour MP Kate Osborne returns to the Post Office scandal, saying "we wouldn't have any action" without the ITV drama, Mr Bates vs The Post Office, putting a spotlight on the issue at the start of the year. This claim is met by angry shouts from the Tory benches. Osborne goes on to ask if the prime minister will bring to the Commons a law to exonerate victims before the next election. Sunak says that will come "very, very soon". T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
