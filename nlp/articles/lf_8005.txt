Israel has declared an area of the occupied West Bank as state land - the biggest in decades, according to activists - which could now be used for settlement activity. The timing of the announcement, by far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, was significant, coinciding with the arrival in Israel of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken for talks on the Gaza war. Blinken recently declared settlements in the West Bank to be "inconsistent with international law" - a reversal of the US's position under the Trump administration. Smotrich - an arch-proponent of Jewish settlement activity in the West Bank - said 800 hectares (1,977 acres) of land in the northern Jordan Valley were now state-owned, meaning they can be developed. "While there are those in Israel and the world who seek to undermine our right over the Judea and Samaria [Biblical terms for the West Bank] area and the country in general, we are promoting settlement through hard work and in a strategic manner all over the country," he said. The announcement is likely to anger the US at a time of growing tensions with Israel over the intensity of its offensive in Gaza. There are about 700,000 Jewish settlers who live in some 140 settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, areas occupied by Israel since the 1967 Middle East war and claimed by Palestinians for a future state. The settlements are considered illegal by most of the international community, though Israel disputes this. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
