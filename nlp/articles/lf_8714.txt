Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh has confirmed to Arabic media that three of his sons have been killed in an air strike in Gaza. It follows reports in a Hamas-affiliated news agency in Gaza that three sons - Hazem, Amir, and Muhammad Ismail Haniyeh - and several of his grandchildren had died in the strike in Beach refugee camp in the west of Gaza City. The head of Hamas's political bureau, who is based in Qatar, told Al Jazeera in a phone interview that his sons had remained in Gaza during the war. Blurred images shown on the network showed bodies being covered as they lay on rubble. These are not the first members of Haniyeh's family to have been killed in the war - another son was reportedly killed in February, while his brother and nephew were killed in October, followed by a grandson in November.
