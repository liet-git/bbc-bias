T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. The judge is now reading out some letters and statements by high-ranking UN officials about the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip. Some of these letters observe a breakdown of Gazan society and that the humanitarian crisis is only worsening. Donoghue says the court considers that the civilian population in Gaza remains extremely vulnerable. She notes that the Israeli military operation is ongoing and that the prime minister has said the war will take "many months". Israel says it has taken efforts to mitigate harm against civilians, the court notes, but while such steps "are to be encouraged", the judge says they're not enough. The humanitarian situation is at serious risk of deterioration before the court renders its final judgement, she says, and therefore there is a sense of urgency here. Judge Joan Donoghue.
