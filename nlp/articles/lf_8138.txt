After shouts from Tory benches that Sue Gray was the senior Labour figure claimed to be influencing the Speaker's decision, Hoyle makes a robust defence. He says "I have never met with Sue Gray today, I didn't bump into her today, I am offended by that comment and I think you would like to withdraw it. "That is the danger - that  we've ended up with this House's speculation of not what is fact and what is factual. "I am true to this House. . . I tried to do what I thought was the right thing for all sides of this House. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
