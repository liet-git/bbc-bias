The former director of the CIA General David Petraeus has told the BBC that Israel has to "clear and hold all of Gaza" to achieve its stated mission of destroying Hamas and rescuing the hostages. Petraeus, a retired US general who served in Afghanistan and Iraq, compares the war to the battle against the so-called Islamic State. "If you look at the case of [the Iraqi town of] Mosul and destruction of the Islamic State - and I think Hamas can be compared to that, though it's an imperfect analogy, but if that is the model, you have to destroy Hamas, you cannot reconcile with them. " Mosul was recaptured by the Iraqi army, assisted by US-led coalition warplanes, in 2017 during a huge military operation that left large areas in ruins and killed thousands of civilians. Petraeus says that after the current war, Gaza will have to be rebuilt. However, once Hamas has been destroyed it may have to be Israel that "takes on that task", because of a lack of alternatives, the general adds. Petraeus also tells the BBC that it is a "very legitimate concern" that Israelâ€™s military operation in Gaza could radicalise future generations.
