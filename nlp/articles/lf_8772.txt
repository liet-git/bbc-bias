The so-called Philadelphi Corridor, where the IDF says it operated overnight, is a narrow strip about 14km (8.6 miles) long which runs the length of Gaza's border with Egypt. It includes the Rafah crossing, which Israel seized from Hamas on 7 May. The corridor is part of a wider, demilitarised zone agreed upon by Israel and Egypt when Israel withdrew its troops and settlers from Gaza in 2005. As part of the accord, Egypt was allowed to deploy a small number of border guards on its side to stop weapons smuggling and infiltrations. Since 2007 though, Hamas has been in control of the Gaza side, digging tunnels and smuggling arms, with taxation on goods brought in that way becoming a major source of income. Egypt flooded and demolished many tunnels but some survived and new ones were dug. Israel says it has identified 50 tunnels crossing into Egypt. Back in December 2023, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel had to take control of the border area, including the Philadelphi Corridor, to "ensure [its] demilitarisation". The IDF has now taken control of Zoroub Hill, the highest hill overlooking the Gaza-Egypt border, giving it effective control of a 9km stretch of the corridor. Egypt has previously said it will not reopen its side of the Rafah crossing for aid until the Gazan side is handed back to the Palestinians. That is a prospect which now seems ever more distant.
