We’re going to be pausing our coverage shortly, but you can get up to speed on the developments that we covered here today. Most of the day’s updates focused around the news that the Israeli military sacked two senior officers as a consequence of an Israeli strike that killed seven World Central Kitchen (WCK) aid workers in Gaza on Monday. Our correspondent in Jerusalem gave us a detailed account inside the IDF’s briefing on that attack, which you can read about here. Other important developments include: An initial inquiry released today by the IDF revealed that its drone operators mistook an aid worker carrying a bag for a gunman and proceeded to target a van belonging to WCK. WCK has said Israel's apologies “represent cold comfort” as it called for an "independent commission" because the IDF "cannot credibly investigate its own failure" Divisions are forming within major UK political parties, as senior Labour and Conservative figures argued for a ban on arms sales to Israel. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is coming under pressure from members of his coalition after he announced Israel would be reopening the humanitarian corridors into Gaza to allow for more aid. There continues to be serious concerns about the welfare of Gazans after aid organisations suspended their operations in the wake of Monday's attack.
