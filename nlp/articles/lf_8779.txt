China has called on Israel to “stop its attacks on Rafah” after Sunday's strike, which killed dozens in a displaced persons camp. Beijing expressed “grave concern over the ongoing Israeli military operations in Rafah", foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said, according to the AFP news agency. It comes amid a wave of international condemnation over the strike. In a statement on Monday, UN secretary general António Guterres said the strike had "killed scores of innocent civilians who were only seeking shelter from this deadly conflict". The UN's human rights chief, Volker Turk, said the attack suggested that there had been "no apparent change in the methods and means of warfare used by Israel that have already led to so many civilian deaths". The US called the images "heart-breaking" but insisted Israel had a right to defend itself, adding that "Israel must take every precaution possible to protect civilians", while the EU's top diplomat, Josep Borrell, called Sunday's strike "horrifying". At least 45 people were killed in Sunday's strike, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
