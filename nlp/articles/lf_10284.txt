John Kirby, the White House's spokesman on national security matters, has been asked about the delays repeatedly yesterday and today. At a news briefing here at the White House yesterday, Kirby said only that US support for Israel was "ironclad", although he did not address the shipment directly. Just a few minutes ago, Kirby was again asked about the reported delays, responding only that he had nothing to add. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
