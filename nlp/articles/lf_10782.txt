International media crews have gathered outside the Peace Palace, home to the ICJ. There arenâ€™t any protesters here yet, like we saw during the oral hearings two weeks ago. That's got nothing to do with the blustery weather, but rather the fact the announcement that the ruling on provisional measures to be delivered today was given at relatively short notice, meaning everyone, including ICJ staff have been scrambling to prepare.
