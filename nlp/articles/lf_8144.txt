 F-N-S-T-A-R-T. 8144 F-N-E-N-D.  D-A-T-E-S-T-A-R-T. 2024-02-21 D-A-T-E-E-N-D.  T-I-T-L-E-S-T-A-R-T. House last sat in private more than two decades ago. T-I-T-L-E-E-N-D.  T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. A half-empty Chamber is now trying to decide whether to continue the sitting in private. That's a very rare move and last happened more than two decades ago, in 2001. It means all members of the public must leave, broadcasting of proceedings ends, and the official record Hansard does not produce a transcript of what MPs say. However, the results of decisions are published. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
