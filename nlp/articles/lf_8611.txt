The US government says it remains incredibly concerned about the risk of the conflict in Gaza spreading to the wider region after the killing of senior Hamas leader Saleh al-Arouri in Beirut on Tuesday. Speaking during a regular press briefing, state department spokesman Matthew Miller says he cannot offer an assessment on who carried out the killing, adding that Washington was not given advance notice of the strike. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied involvement. Miller also says that suggestions that the US was involved in the explosions in Iran today are "ridiculous". He adds there is no reason to believe Israel was behind the blast. Earlier on Wednesday, two explosions killed more than 100 people at a ceremony in Iran earlier to commemorate top commander Qassem Soleimani, who was killed by a US drone in 2020. Iranian officials blamed unspecified "terrorists". T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
