T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Before Israel launched its southern offensive a week ago, US officials told Israel it must limit the toll on civilians – saying too many Palestinians were killed in its operations against Hamas in northern Gaza. Last night, after meeting the UK's Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron, the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken made his strongest public criticism yet of Israel’s handling of this stage of the war. "It remains imperative that Israel put a premium on civilian protection,” he said. Israel insists it’s taking steps to minimise harm to civilians. But in recent days, hundreds have been killed, including in areas where people were previously told to seek safety. In a development that should help smooth the way for more aid to reach those running desperately low on basic supplies, Israel has also agreed to open its Kerem Shalom crossing to screen goods being taken into Gaza from Egypt. Washington has been pressing for the move. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
