It’s been more than 45 years since the first Arab-Israeli peace talks, launched by the surprise visit to Jerusalem by the president of Egypt. Some of the talks have been successful - including between Israel and Jordan, and Israel and several Arab League states. But a settlement has still not been reached in what many consider to be the core conflict - the dispute between the Israelis and Palestinians. The first talks between Israel and the Palestinians - represented by the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) - didn't happen until 1992. The Oslo Agreement the following year stipulated that Israeli troops would withdraw in stages from the West Bank and Gaza, and that a "Palestinian Interim Self-Governing Authority" would be set up for a five-year transitional period. The two sides agreed to eventually hold “final status” talks, but Hamas and other Palestinian rejectionist groups did not accept Oslo and launched suicide bomb attacks on Israelis. There was also opposition within Israel from the right wing, which became dominant, and Oslo was only partially implemented. On-off talks continued down the years afterwards, but they collapsed in 2014 and no agreement between the two sides has ever been reached.
