While attacks are continuing on Rafah this evening, Israel says it is planning to send a delegation to negotiate the ceasefire deal further after saying it was "far from meeting Israel's demands". This was confirmed by the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday. Mediations which have resulted in the offer from Hamas have been led by Egypt, with involvement from Qatar. It is not clear what exactly Hamas have agreed to as part of the deal, but it is thought to include the release of hostages and return of displaced Palestinians within Gaza. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
