Thanks for joining our live coverage as protests prompted by the war in Gaza spread across university campuses across the US. More than 100 people were arrested at Columbia University last week, many of them students, for refusing to leave their “solidarity encampments”, following multiple warnings from the university. Since then, a wave of demonstrations at several other locations have popped up – from California to New York – leading to hundreds more arrests. Some 108 people were taken into custody in Boston overnight. The protesters are saying their free speech rights are being aggressively silenced. There have also been reports of antisemitic incidents at some of the protests - which was previously condemned by the White House. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
