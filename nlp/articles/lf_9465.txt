The family of killed aid worker Lalzawmi "Zomi" Frankcom say she would be "heartbroken" if her death stopped aid reaching people in Gaza. Frankcom, an Australian national, was one of seven aid workers for charity World Central Kitchen (WCK) killed in an Israeli strike on their convoy on Monday. Speaking to the Sydney Morning Herald, her family said the deaths "should never have happened" and "the lives of humanitarian workers should always be protected". Several aid groups, including WCK, have suspended their operations in Gaza in response to Monday's strike. â€œZomi would be heartbroken if this incident, as tragic as it is, prevented aid from being given to those in need," the family adds.
