So far today, we've heard reaction to Iran's weekend strikes on Israel from the UK government and the UN. Let's now hear from Israel itself. David Mencer, an Israeli government spokesman, says Israel's right to defend itself is of paramount importance following the events of Saturday night. "We are at the very essence not a war-seeking nation," Mencer tells Radio 4's Today programme, adding: "Israelis spent a night - mums, dads, kids - in and out of bomb shelters in our country. We know that the tyrants of Tehran orchestrated not only this attack, but also the 7 October massacre of my people. " He adds that it's "up to Israel to decide how to defend its people". Iran's missile attack against Israel followed a strike on the Iranian consulate in Syria at the start of this month. Iran said it killed two Revolutionary Guards generals and five other officers and blamed Israel. Israel has not said it carried out the consulate strike, but is widely believed to have been behind it. Iranian officials have publicly denied being involved or ordering Hamasâ€™s 7 October attacks on Israel. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
