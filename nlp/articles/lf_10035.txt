For the last few hours, US national security spokesman has been making the rounds of US Sunday morning talk shows, with one message consistent in all his appearances: that US does not want a wider war in the Middle East. On his last appearance, on CBS Meet the Press, Kirby said that what happens in the region "certainly has an effect on us", particularly the thousands of US troops deployed to Iraq, Syria and Jordan. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Kirby added, is "well aware that the President [Biden] is not looking for a conflict with Iran. " "We're not looking for a war with Iran. We're not looking for a broader regional conflict," he said. "But we will do what we have to do to help Israel defend itself. " Kirby also said that the US has communicated a warning to Iran about potential attacks on US personnel in the region. "We're going to whatever steps we need to protect our troops, our facilities, and our ships in the region going forward," he added. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
