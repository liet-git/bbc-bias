T-I-T-L-E-E-N-D.  T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. The Hamas-run government media office in Gaza has called on Egypt to open the Rafah border crossing to allow the transfer of 6,000 wounded people from the territory for treatment abroad "immediately and urgently". It makes the plea in light of the "catastrophic reality that the health sector and hospitals in the Gaza Strip are suffering from". In a statement, it says Israeli bombardment has put 30 facilities "completely out of service", adding that the "number of infections has now exceeded 58,000". It says that currently only 10 to 20 wounded are allowed to be transferred through the crossing daily and urges Egypt to improve its mechanism so that "hundreds and thousands" can be approved for transfer "instead of approving only a few dozen". The media office issues an appeal "to all countries of the world to intervene" and calls on the international community and the US to put pressure on Israel to stop the war. "We call on everyone to bear their moral and humanitarian responsibility in the face of the suffering of civilians, children and women in the Gaza Strip, as they are slaughtered from vein to vein while the world watches this tragedy.
