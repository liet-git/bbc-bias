It failed, with vetoes from Russia and China. But my colleague Nada Tawfik explained earlier how the langauge was stronger than any previous resolutions drafted by the US. And in Israel, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Israeli Prime Minisiter Benjamin Netanyahu. It was Blinken's sixth trip to the region since 7 October.
