Amid a show of solidarity with war-torn Gaza today, most shops are shuttered, and schools, universities and businesses closed across the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. “It’s the public’s strongest weapon,” says Malak from East Jerusalem, who supports the strike. “It seems dystopian to continue on with my life and strive after personal development in my career when people in Gaza, which is one hour from me by car, are getting slaughtered and deprived of the basic necessities of life. ”. In Jordan as well, a BBC producer says that many stores and workplaces have responded to a call for a global strike. There is visibly less traffic on the roads. After the US vetoed a UN Security Council resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, Palestinian activists began calling for a day of action to raise pressure on Israel. On social media they are using the hashtag: #ShutItDown4Palestine. It is unclear to what extent the plan has caught on internationally. Shops in Jerusalem's Old City shuttered and closed this morning. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
