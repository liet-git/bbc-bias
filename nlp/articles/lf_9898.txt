Philippe Lazzarini, commissioner general of UNRWA, says, 17,000 children have been separated from their parents, and swathes of Gaza's population are suffering from malnutrition. "We talk about famine in the north, where we have 300,000 people and we haven't been able to organise a convoy since 23 January," Lazzarini tells reporters. "At the same time, because of the pressure and the military offensive taking place, it's becoming more and more difficult to operate in Rafah itself. " He added that UNRWA trucks have been looted and vandalised there in recent days. "The coming days will tell us if we will be able to continue operating. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
