T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. More now from the World Central Kitchen (WCK), which is calling for an "independent commission" to be created to investigate the killings. The charity says Israel's military "cannot credibly investigate its own failure in Gaza". Without "systemic change" within the military, there will be "more military failures, more apologies and more grieving families", the statement adds. The charity says the "root cause" of the "unjustified" attack is the severe lack of food in Gaza and calls on Israel to "dramatically increase" the volume of aid travelling by land. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
