The representative of the UAE, who proposed this resolution, says she and other officials say they visited Rafah and saw the "hell unleashed on Gaza following the Hamas attacks on Israel". The UAE's ambassador to the UN, Lana Zaki Nusseibeh, explains the situation at the border between Gaza and Egypt is "unbearable", with thousands of aid trucks "trying and failing to enter a choke point" designed for pedestrian traffic. The diplomat adds the UN has reported that the proportion of people hungry in Gaza is greater than any other country in 20 years. "Unless we take drastic action there will be famine in Gaza," she says, going on to warn about the risk of "regional spillover" into the broader Middle East. Nusseibeh goes on to say there "must be an international response" to the crisis, after praising Egypt for its work so far. She says the draft resolution has been written with "extensive consultations between various parties" and adds that it "responds with action to dire situation on the ground" for people in Gaza and "demands the release of the hostages" held there by Hamas. All available routes for aid to get into Gaza must be used to allow "life-saving aid to enter" and work must be carried out to create the conditions for a pause in fighting, Nusseibeh adds.
