The US risks "complicity in war crimes" by using its veto to block the UN ceasefire resolution, Human Rights Watch says. The humanitarian organisation's UN director, Louis Charbonneau, says the US veto has prevented the Security Council from "making some of the calls the US itself has been demanding of Israel and Palestinian armed groups". Charbonneau says this includes compliance with international humanitarian law, protection of civilians, and releasing all civilians held hostage. "By continuing to provide Israel with weapons and diplomatic cover as it commits atrocities, including collectively punishing the Palestinian civilian population in Gaza, the US risks complicity in war crimes.
