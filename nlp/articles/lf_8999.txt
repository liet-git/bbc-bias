It is 16:00 in Israel and Gaza (14:00 GMT) and here are today's main headlines: The Hamas-run health ministry says at least 210 people have been killed in Gaza in the last 24 hours , while 360 others have been injured. The new figure, according to the ministry, takes the number of people killed since the start of the war to 21,320. On Thursday, bombardment has been reported across Gaza, in Lahia (in the north of Gaza), Khan Younis (in the south) and Maghazi refugee camp (in the centre) Also on Thursday, Israeli media quoted an official from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), who reportedly said the use of incorrect munition during its air strikes on the Maghazi refugee camp on 24 December led to "extensive collateral damage". Asked about those reports by the BBC, the IDF said it regretted harm done to "uninvolved individuals" In the occupied West Bank , Israeli soldiers have raided several money exchange premises, seizing millions of shekels. A United Nations report into human rights violations in the West Bank concluded that Palestinians live in constant terror of violence from both Israeli forces and settlers. In Israel, the first conscientious objector since the start of the Gaza offensive , after the 7 October Hamas attacks, was imprisoned to 30 days in a military jail - the 18-year-old man will be held there for refusing to enlist in the army. Separately, near the country's border with Lebanon, fighting has intensified and Israeli war cabinet minister Benny Gantz has warned that if the world and the Lebanese government didnâ€™t act to stop the attacks, then the IDF would take matters into its own hands.
