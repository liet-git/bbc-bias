Let's look a bit more at the situation in the southern town of Rafah, reportedly one of those hit by the latest wave of Israeli iar strikes. Tens of thousands of Palestinians across Gaza moved to Rafah - which borders Egypt - because of intense bombardment in the enclave's northern and central parts. The displacement also follows orders from Israeli forces urging civilians to flee parts of Gaza where Israel says it is working to eradicate Hamas. The director of UNRWA, the UN's relief agency, has told the BBC that there are "well over a million people" seeking safety in the city. He has also said that "hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people are now sleeping in the open" as a result of the overcrowding. White says those people are bedding down "under flimsy pieces of plastic". T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
