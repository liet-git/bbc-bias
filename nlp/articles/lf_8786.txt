Today’s recognition of the state of Palestine by three European countries is on one level prosaically diplomatic: documents will be exchanged, consulates will become embassies, representatives will transform into ambassadors. On another level it is deeply political. Ireland, Norway and Spain want to revive focus on a two-state solution. It is not enough, they say, to work only for a ceasefire and hostage exchange. And they are acting together to put pressure on their counterparts to follow suit. Israel is outraged, saying this rewards terrorism. It’s withdrawn its own ambassadors from the three countries and formally reprimanded their envoys in Israel. All this may encourage Palestinians and shift the diplomatic dial but it’s unlikely to change much on the ground. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
