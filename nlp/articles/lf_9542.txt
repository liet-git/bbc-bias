"Our brave compatriot, Mr Damian Soból from Przemyśl, helped people in need in Gaza where there is a humanitarian crisis. He was killed during an attack which the Israeli army has accepted responsibility for," Sikorski said in a video posted on X. Earlier, Sikorski had said he'd already spoken with the Israeli ambassador to Poland, Yacov Livne, and asked for an urgent explanation into the attack.
