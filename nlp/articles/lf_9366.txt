We’ve just made contact with 40-year-old Nashwa Rezeq in Rafah. We spoke to her last year after she fled from her home in the neighbourhood of al-Zahra, which was later bombed. In a short voice note, Nashwa says she received more bad news overnight: It’s been a very, very dreadful night because we just received the news that my father-in-law’s house that we thought we’d go to after the war has been bombed. It was a night that I wouldn’t wish on anyone. We are 28 people living in two rooms. I don’t know what my fate will be, where we will go with the children, especially as Ramadan is coming. Read more about the neighbourhood Nashwa lived in before she became displaced. Nashwa Rezeq is currently sheltering in Rafah. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
