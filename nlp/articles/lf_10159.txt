T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Speaking in Qatar yesterday as part of his most recent Middle East tour, Antony Blinken warned Palestinians must not be pressured into leaving Gaza and must be allowed to return to their homes, once conditions allow. The US secretary of stateâ€™s comments came alongside a condemnation of statements by Israeli far-right ministers, who have called for the displacement of Palestinians. Israel's Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said Palestinians should leave Gaza and make way for Israeli settlers who could "make the desert bloom", while National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir has issued a call "to encourage the migration of Gaza residents" as a "solution" to the crisis. The official line from the Israeli government is that Gazans will eventually be able to return to their homes, though it has yet to outline how or when this will be possible. Following these comments in recent days, Blinken said yesterday: "Palestinian civilians must be able to return home as soon as conditions allow. "They cannot, they must not be pressed to leave Gaza.
