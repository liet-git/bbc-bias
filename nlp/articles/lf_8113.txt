Sir Lindsay Hoyle has a big job to do today to regain the confidence of MPs. The Labour party don't really have a problem with what he did because they say what he did was in his power to do and it's happened before. The problem he has is that the SNP particularly are furious because they feel what was meant to be their day of debate got hijacked because a Labour amendment was chosen to be voted on first and theirs never reached a vote. The Conservatives are pretty cross too. Hoyle explained his actions saying he wanted all perspectives to be debated, but there has been a lot of criticism. This morning government sources are saying what happened was unprecedented and that he has to account for what's happened. They're also asking if he was under pressure from Labour and if he was being induced to do this. The Labour side have said this is total nonsense, it's up to the Speaker to decide, this has been done before and in the end, their amendment did pass. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
