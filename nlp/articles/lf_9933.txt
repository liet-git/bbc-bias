Danon is a member of the Knesset for Likud and close to Prime Minister Netanyahu. He tells the HardTalk programme that the government would take action “to make sure that the leaders of Iran will think very carefully next time before they give the orders to send ballistic missiles and cruise missiles into Israel”.
