The UN's warning that Israel should not mount a full military push in Rafah follows on from unusually sharp criticism by the US - President Joe Biden on Thursday called Israel's retaliatory campaign in Gaza "over the top". On Monday, thse comments were echoed by the EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell who urged allies of Israel to stop sending weapons as "too many people" are being killed in Gaza.
