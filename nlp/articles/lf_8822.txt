T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Israel's Ambassador to the UN has thanked US President Joe Biden for "standing firmly by our side" by blocking resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. In a social media post , Gilad Erdan says the US showed "leadership and values and "a little of the light dispelled a lot of the darkness". Erdan is critical of the UN, saying he it is shocking that while "Hamas is firing rockets at Israel" the UN is "busy debating a distorted resolution that will enable Hamasâ€™ terrorists to stay in power in Gaza and does not condemn Hamas or call for the release of the hostages". "A ceasefire will be possible only with the return of all the hostages and the destruction of Hamas," adds Erdan. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
