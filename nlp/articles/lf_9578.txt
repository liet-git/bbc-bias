Missing from today's list of countries announcing a date for recognising a Palestinian state is Belgium, which on the face of it seems surprising. For months, Belgian PM Alexander De Croo has worked closely with his Spanish counterpart on the war in Gaza. Last November they visited the Rafah crossing between Egypt and Gaza together and were both highly critical of Israel's military operation. Brussels was on Pedro SÃ¡nchez's itinerary last month when he sought to co-ordinate today's announcement. Belgium's deputy prime minister, Petra De Sutter, says Belgium should now follow suit, but so far there are no concrete plans beyond discussing it in today's cabinet meeting. Not everyone in the ruling coalition is keen on the idea and with elections less than three weeks away, both federal and European, Belgium may be kicking this particular can down the road. It also holds the rotating presidency of the European Council and is apparently more keen on playing the role of mediator. Foreign Minister Hadja Lahbib said recently that Belgium wanted to do more work on "rationalising" what had to be done, and setting emotions aside. The Belgian PM (L) has been highly critical of Israel's military operation in Gaza. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
