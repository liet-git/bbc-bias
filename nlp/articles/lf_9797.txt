This is not the first time al-Shifa Hospital has been raided by the Israeli military. In fact, it was among the first the be raided back in November 2023, a month after the war broke out. Hundreds of displaced Palestinians are thought to be sheltering at the hospital that was once Gaza's main medical facility prior to the conflict, though now its operations have been severely disrupted after months of fighting. The IDF said it found a network of tunnels under the hospital used by Hamas when it raided al-Shifa in November 2023, as well as weapons. A World Health Organization team was allowed into the hospital following the November raid and described it as a "death zone". Last year, the BBC went inside al-Shifa with the IDF - take a look at that story here. Humanitarian groups say al-Shifa hospital (December 2023 pic) has struggled to keep operating in recent months.
