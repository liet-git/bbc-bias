There's plenty to unpack from today's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, during which the Israel-Gaza war and Tory defection dominated the agenda. Let's have a look at the key moments from this morning's show: UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron said restricting arms deliveries to Israel because of its war in Gaza would strengthen Hamas and make a deal to free Israeli hostages less likely. He reiterated that the Israeli army should not carry out a major offensive in Rafah. Putting British boots on the ground in Gaza would be "a risk we should not take," he added. Labour MP Jonathan Ashworth said the party does not want to see British-made weapons used in a Rafah offensive should it go ahead. Ashworth also points to Tory defector Natalie Elphicke dismissing as "nonsense" claims she lobbied the Lord Chancellor over husband's sexual assault case. On the panel, former Chancellor Nadhim Zahawi was questioned about his tax affairs. "My mistakes are my own," he said, adding that he paid HMRC "just shy of Â£5m" after admitting a "careless mistake" And actor Dominic West told Laura he has ambitions to play a villain in a James Bond movie. He's up for a Bafta TV award later, which you can follow live on BBC News this afternoon. UK arms exports change would make Hamas stronger, says Cameron. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
