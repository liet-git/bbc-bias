If you are just joining us, here is what's been happening today. Gazans are marking the festival of Eid al-Fitr in circumstances very different to last year, with many describing how their usual celebrations have been unable to take place as they live without basic necessities. "This year there are no sweets nor joy, only pain, sadness, oppression and mourning," says the BBC's Gaza correspondent. US President Joe Biden has called on Israel to agree to a six-to-eight-week ceasefire, another sign of growing American frustration at the situation in Gaza. But current and former US officials have told the BBC the pressure put on Israel has not been enough, in response to last week's deadly air strike on a humanitarian convoy. Meanwhile, fighting has continued in the centre of the Gaza Strip, according to the IDF, which says troops have fought Hamas fighters face-to-face in the last day. It comes after Israeli Prime Minster Benjamin Netanyahu said he had set a date for a ground offensive in the southern city of Rafah, despite international warnings about such a move. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
