The United Nation Security Council vote on its widely-anticipated resolution on humanitarian aid for Gaza is coming up soon. It comes after days of negotiations to avoid a US veto. The draft does not call for a ceasefire and leaves Israel in control of monitoring aid deliveries. The UAE - which sponsored the resolution - says it can make a real difference for Palestinian civilians. We'll bring you the result of the vote right here, so stay tuned. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
