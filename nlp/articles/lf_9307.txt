T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Some of those being held hostage in the Gaza Strip are facing an “immediate danger to life”, families of the detained have said in a letter to Israel’s war cabinet, in which they demand immediate action to secure their release. The letter says that of those being held, at least a third are suffering from “underlying illnesses that require regular medical treatment”, and that the lack of treatment is leading to an “immediate danger to life” or “irreversible complications such as stroke or heart attack”. It adds that many of those being detained received injuries during the attacks, including “gunshot wounds, amputations, shrapnel penetration and more”. “We received solid intelligence that there are abductees whose condition has deteriorated and are now in immediate danger due to untreated injuries or illnesses,” it adds. The Israeli government has been under constant pressure to bring the hostages home. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
