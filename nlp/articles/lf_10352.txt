We've got some more to bring you now from the White House news conference that's been going on (see our last few posts). In addition to a series of questions on Rafah and a potential ceasefire, US national security spokesman John Kirby was asked about the Israeli move to shut down Al Jazeera's network in the country. In response, Kirby says the US does "not support" that action, remarking that the work of a free press is vital. "It's important to help inform the policy making process," he adds. The Israeli move against Al Jazeera - and the Israeli raid on its headquarters in Jerusalem - was not a focus of discussion of the call between Biden and Netanyahu earlier, Kirby says.
