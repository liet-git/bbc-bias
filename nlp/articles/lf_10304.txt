Conflict has continued a day after Hamas accepted truce terms offered by Qatari and Egyptian mediators, which Israel rejected as being far from its "basic requirements". Here's the latest: Israel has taken "operational control" of the Gaza side of the Rafah crossing - a vital entry point for aid - after striking eastern Rafah overnight, killing 20 Hamas members. A senior Israeli official says a team of Israeli negotiators will go to Cairo "in the next few hours" to see whether Hamas can be persuaded to change its latest ceasefire offer. It comes after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dismissed the deal - drawn up by Egyptian mediators - as far from meeting "core demands" The exact terms of the deal Hamas has agreed to have not been confirmed. Hamas says it has fired rockets at the Israeli-controlled Kerem Shalom crossing , which was already closed after an earlier Hamas rocket attack killed four Israeli soldiers over the weekend. Palestinians are continuing to evacuate after Israel's military warned civilians to leave eastern parts of Rafah ahead of the strikes, with more than 100,000 people affected. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, continues to voice concern over the humanitarian situation , and has warned of the impact diminished aid supplies will have on civilians.
