Thanks for rejoining our live coverage of the Israel-Hamas war. Here are five things you need to know since we paused our coverage last night : Israeli forces are pushing further into southern Gaza - where have ordered people leave the centre of the southern city of Khan Younis. Hundreds of thousands of Gazans previously fled there to find a shelter from air strikes in the north. Meanwhile, the head of the Israeli army has called for his troops to "press harder" to defeat its enemy, Hamas. Questions have been raised about footage which has emerged, appearing to show Palestinians surrendering to Israeli forces in northern Gaza. The UN has warned that half of Gazans are starving - and that 90% of people in the Palestinian territory cannot eat every day, as a result of the Israeli siege. After Hamas showed a video of what it claimed was a failed Israeli rescue operation, an Israeli hostagesâ€™ group on Saturday confirmed the death of a hostage, Sahar Baruch, 25. This is Ece Goksedef, Ali Abbas Ahmadi and James FitzGerald in London - and with our teams on the ground, we'll continue to bring you the latest. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
