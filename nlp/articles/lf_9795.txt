Hamas has condemned what it calls a “new crime” and an “aggression” by Israel on the al-Shifa hospital in Gaza. In a statement posted on its Telegram channel today, Hamas says Israel “directly targeted” the hospital buildings “with no regard for the patients, medical crews and the displaced people inside”. The Israeli army says it has arrested more than 80 people, including Hamas militants, during the overnight raid. The army raided the hospital after it said it received intelligence that Hamas militants had regrouped and set up a command centre there.  The military says that it has gained control of the complex.
