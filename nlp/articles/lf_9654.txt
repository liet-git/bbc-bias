We're going to close this page soon - but you'll be able to keep up to date with everything we've covered right here . Before then, here's a reminder of what's been happening: After almost six months of fighting, the UN Security Council today passed a resolution calling for an "immediate ceasefire" in Gaza for the first time - after the US refrained from vetoing, instead abstaining. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reacted by cancelling an Israeli delegation visit to the White House, while Israel's permanent representative to the UN told Council members he was "disgusted" The White House said its abstention did not represent a shift in policy and was a result of the resolution's final wording not condemning Hamas's 7 October attack on Israel - but Netanyahu insisted it was "a clear retreat" The BBC's Jeremy Bowen explored the depth of the US-Israel rift - and what today might mean - here. Humanitarian organisations welcomed the measure, saying it would give hope to those trapped in Gaza - as did the Palestinian representative at the UN, who said it was a "vote for humanity to prevail" This coverage was written by Barbara Tasch, Bernd Debusmann, Nadine Yousif, Sophie Abdulla, Ece Goksedef, Ali Abbas Ahmadi and Gem O'Reilly.
