T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, who has been touring the Middle East during the past week, dropped in on a US aircraft carrier which is currently stationed in the eastern Mediterranean. According to a Reuters report, Austin thanked the crew of USS Gerald R Ford for their role in preventing Israel's war in Gaza from becoming a wider regional conflict, saying "this carrier and crew are making history". "Sometimes our greatest achievements are the bad things that we stop from happening. And at a moment of huge tensions in the region, you all have been the lynchpin to preventing a wider regional conflict," he added. The US deployed the massive nuclear-powered aircraft carrier - which houses eight squadrons of aircraft - alongside other warships to support Israel and deter other groups, such as Lebanon-based Hezbollah, from joining the conflict. Lloyd Austin thanks the aircraft carrier's crew for preventing a wider regional escalation. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
