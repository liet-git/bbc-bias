It's just gone 08:30 here in London, where we are taking over the coverage of the page from our colleagues in Singapore. Let's bring you a quick recap of the key headlines so far this morning and what we expect to happen later on: The head of militant group Hamas has arrived in Cairo to meet Egypt's intelligence chief. Ismail Haniyeh is usually based in Qatar, but his visit to the Egyptian capital is the latest sign of possible movement in negotiations. Egypt, along with Qatar, helped to broker a truce last month which lasted a week and saw a number of Israeli hostages released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. Israeli President Isaac Herzog has said his country was ready for another humanitarian pause in Gaza to enable the release of hostages. Also later today, the UN Security Council is due to vote on a delayed resolution calling for a pause in the fighting. The latest text, which it's hoped will avoid a US veto, is said to call for a "suspension," rather than a cessation of hostilities. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
