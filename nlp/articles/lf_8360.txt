T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. The Israeli military says it has found the tunnel network once used by Hamasâ€™s senior leadership in Gaza City, which it describes as an "underground terrorist city". In an update, the Israel Defense Forces says its troops have secured control over what it calls the "elite quarter" of Gaza's largest city - around Palestine Square in the al-Rimal area. The IDF says after weeks of fighting its forces took control of the area in Gaza's largest city, which it says is where Hamas's "administrative and military leadership operated" - including political leaders like Ismail Haniyeh, and military commanders Yahya Sinwar and Muhammad Deif. It adds that Palestine Square is the centre of a "strategic tunnel network", which connects to the "underground infrastructure in the area of   the Rantisi Hospital and the Shifa Hospital". The IDF shared video footage of soldiers exploring a series of tunnels and satellite images with alleged entrances marked, but no evidence of them being connected to either hospital was provided. It also says the tunnel shafts that form part of the "underground terrorist city" were built in the "residences and offices of senior officials", which were used to direct Hamas's "operational activity" and for "protected daily movement through the heart of Gaza City".
