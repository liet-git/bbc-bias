The representative for the US is now explaining why he vetoed the resolution. He calls the process behind this draft resolution "rushed," and says it lacked "appropriate consultation". He added that it did not include language that the US requested, like condemning Hamas' 7 October attack. "Unfortunately, nearly all of our recommendations were ignored," he says. "The result of this rushed process was an imbalanced resolution that was divorced from reality. " He concludes by saying that the US cannot support an "unsustainable ceasefire" than only "plants the seeds for the next war". T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
