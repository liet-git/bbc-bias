Days-long protests at Emerson College in Boston, Massachusetts culminated in more than 100 protesters being arrested overnight, and injuries to four police officers. Police told an affiliate for CBS News, the BBC’s media partner, that three of the officers' injuries were minor, and one was “more serious”. They said none of the arrested individuals were hurt. Student descriptions of the scene painted a violent picture. “There were people getting thrown down to the ground, arms put behind their back, dragged away, pushed away… without much regard for the safety of those they were removing," one student told CBS. Classes at the university were cancelled for the day on Thursday. Students made an encampment on Sunday night in an alley by the university. They remained until their removal on early Thursday morning, despite warnings from police. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
