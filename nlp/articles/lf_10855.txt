T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Israel has denied an accusation from the head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees that it's been trying to force huge numbers of Gazans into Egypt. In an opinion piece written in the Los Angeles Times , UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini said this was signalled by the Israeli military telling people in north Gaza to flee south, and people then being pushed even further towards the border with Egypt when fighting in the south intensified. Lazzarini went on to suggest that if this trend continued, Gaza "will not be a land for Palestinians anymore. " Israel says the accusation is "simply not true". A defence ministry spokesperson told the AFP news agency: "There is not, never was and never will be an Israeli plan to move the residents of Gaza to Egypt. " Separately, Israel has denied a similar claim made by Jordan. The Reuters news agency quotes an official saying it was "outrageous and false" that it had a systematic plan to push Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip.
