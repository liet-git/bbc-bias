Sharon Alony-Cunion and her three-year-old twin daughters were released from Hamas captivity late last month, but she worries about the safety of her husband, David, who is still being held. “Three days before we were released, they separated David from us. They took him to a different hiding place, and since then I don’t know what has happened to him,” she told Reuters news agency. She says the girls ask every day: "Where’s Daddy? Where’s Daddy?" Sharon was taken hostage on 7 October with her husband and one of their twin girls, she says. Their other daughter was separated from them, before they were reunited in Gaza 10 days later. The conditions were difficult, she said, particularly for children. Sometimes they had to use a sink or a rubbish bin as a toilet, and had to keep the girls quiet, or talk only in whispers, sometimes for as long as 12 hours. She said she had to make up stories to try to keep them quiet. "Every moment you have to be angry at her, tell her quiet, quiet, don’t, don’t,” she said. She said that none of those who have returned from Hamas captivity are the same as they were before the attacks. "We all have so many triggers, every little noise, every door slam, every airplane flying," she said, adding the girls sometimes cling to her or have tantrums. "Life has changed - this is not life. " And she says more needs to be done to free the remaining hostages: “There's a lot of families without a father, without a daughter, without a brother, without a grandfather, grandmother, mother. ”.
