Three Israeli soldiers have been killed in a Hamas rocket attack near one of the main crossings used to deliver aid into Gaza, Israel has said. The Kerem Shalom crossing was closed overnight by Israel following the strike. Subsequent Israeli strikes in the southern Gazan city of Rafah have reportedly killed at least 12 people. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) said 10 projectiles had been fired from an area near the Rafah crossing in southern Gaza, about 3.6km (2.2 miles) from Kerem Shalom. Hamas's armed wing claimed responsibility and said its target was a nearby Israeli army base. They were fired from a site some 350m from a civilian shelter, the IDF said. It called the launches "another clear example of the terrorist organisation's systematic exploitation of humanitarian facilities and spaces, and their continued use of the Gazan civilian population as human shields". Hamas denies it uses civilians as human shields. You can read the full story here . The armed wing of Hamas said it was responsible for rocket fire in the Kerem Shalom border area.
