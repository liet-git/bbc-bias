Isfahan province is a large area in the centre of Iran which takes its name from its largest city. The region is home to significant Iranian military infrastructure, including a large air base, a major missile production complex and several nuclear facilities. Israel would usually tell the US in advance about military action, but Italy's foreign minister Antonio Tajani told reporters at the G7 meeting in Capri that Washington had only been "informed at the very last minute". Speaking at the summit, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken refused to be drawn on the attack, saying only that the US had "not been involved in any offensive operations". The Israeli government has still not officially commented. This latest strike comes less than a week after Iran launched hundreds of missiles and drones at Israel, an incident seen as a dramatic escalation in tensions. Despite its vast scale and unprecedented nature, Iran's attack was largely unsuccessful, with the vast majority of projectiles shot down by Israeli air defences with the help of the US, UK and other allies. That unprecedented attack on Israeli soil was in response to a strike against a building on an Iranian diplomatic compoundin Syria on 1 April. Israel has not publicly confirmed it was behind that strike either, but it is widely accepted that it was. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
