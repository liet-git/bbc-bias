Laura asks the Nato chief if he believes the world is entering a new “era of instability”. Stoltenberg agrees. Nato is a regional alliance but the challenges are global, he says. For example, Stoltenberg says: “China is propping up the Russian war economy, delivering key parts to the defence industry, and in return, Moscow is mortgaging its future to Beijing. " Iran and North Korea are also sending military equipment and ammunition to Russia in exchange for technology, Stoltenberg says. He adds: “And that makes it even more important that like-minded countries, Nato allies, but also our partners in the Asia-Pacific, that we also work more closely together.  And that’s exactly what we do to stand up against this stronger alliance of authoritarian powers. ”. Nato chief says that West must stand up to authoritarian alliance of Russia and China.
