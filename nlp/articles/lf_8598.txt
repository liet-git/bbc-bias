The court has no retrospective jurisdiction - it can only deal with crimes committed after 1 July 2002 when the Rome Statute,  which established the court, came into effect. It has been ratified by 124 countries. Israel and the US have not ratified the treaty. The court has no police force of its own to track down and arrest suspects. It relies on national police services to make arrests and seek their transfer to The Hague. British lawyer Karim Khan became its chief prosecutor in 2021.
