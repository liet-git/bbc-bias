With the list of SNP and Tory MPs who have signed a motion of no confidence in Sir Lindsay Hoyle going up slowly but steadily throughout the day, anger at the Speaker remains - but what this means moving forward remains unclear. Here's how another busy day at Westminster played out: More than 65 MPs have now signed the motion of no confidence. The SNP and a number of Conservatives have expressed anger at Hoyle after his decision on Wednesday to table a Labour amendment over an SNP motion, leading to chaotic scenes in Parliament. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Hoyle's actions were "very concerning", but he didn't go as far as calling for him to stand down. Earlier, the SNP's Westminster leader Stephen Flynn said his party had lost confidence in Hoyle's ability to continue in the role. Hoyle appeared in the chamber this morning and apologised for a second time, saying he had made a mistake and regretted it. But a number of MPs on all sides of the house rallied to Hoyle's defence, with Lib Dem leader Ed Davey saying the Speaker still had the confidence of his party. Meanwhile, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer "categorically" denied allegations he had threatened the Speaker into allowing the Labour amendment. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
