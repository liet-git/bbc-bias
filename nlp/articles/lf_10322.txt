As Israel claims control of the Rafah crossing in Gaza, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, has warned of the impact diminished aid supplies will have on civilians. “The biggest problem we have in the last 24 to 48 hours is the border crossing and not having enough aid supplies come in," Louise Wateridge, a spokeswoman for the agency, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. The situation is “extremely concerning”, she says. Looking ahead, she warns of the risk to Gazans' health, saying the sanitation situation is deteriorating and very high temperatures are expected in the summer with many people currently sheltering in plastic tents. Wateridge, who is in Rafah, says the atmosphere is subdued. Many are waiting to see what happens next, while some are leaving the city, she says. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
