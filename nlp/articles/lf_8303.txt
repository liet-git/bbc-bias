As we’ve been reporting, fighting is continuing in Gaza - despite the UN Security Council resolution calling for a ceasefire being passed for the first time on Monday. Ohad Tal is an Israeli MP from the far-right Religious Zionism party, which is part of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition. Speaking to the BBC World Service’s Newsday programme earlier, he was asked why Israel is continuing its offensive in Gaza in the face of such a resolution. “We have a right to defend ourselves – it’s as simple as that,” Tal replied. He said the world must "make a choice" between supporting Israel or Hamas. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
