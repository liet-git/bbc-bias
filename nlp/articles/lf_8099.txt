Last night, Labour's amendment for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza went through to loud shouts of "aye" without a formal vote, after the government said it would not take part. It is important to note that despite the ferocity of the debate yesterday, the government does not have to adopt Labour's position as the vote is not binding. Conservative Leader of the House Penny Mordaunt said in the chamber yesterday that UK policy remained unchanged. And above all else, it changes nothing at all on the ground in Gaza. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
