Humanitarian charity Oxfam says Israeli authorities conducting checks on aid before it is allowed into Gaza have rejected a warehouse of supplies that included oxygen, incubators and water. In a statement, Oxfam says the reasons for the rejection were not clear, and labelled Israel's checks an "unpredictable and chaotic regime" that "keeps aid snarled up, subjected to onerous, repetitive and unpredictable bureaucratic procedures". Meanwhile, the head of the UN's Palestinian refugee agency, Philippe Lazzarini, says the hunger in the Gaza Strip was "man-made" and could be reversed through "proper political will". Speaking at a news conference in Egypt, he adds: "We are engaged in a race against the clock to try to reverse the impact of the spreading hunger and the looming famine in the Gaza Strip. " Israel has not responded to Oxfam's claims, but Cogat, the Israeli body that coordinates humanitarian aid to Gaza, has previously clashed with Lazzarini and UN organisations on social media, asserting that there is no limit to the amount and movement of aid to Gaza.
