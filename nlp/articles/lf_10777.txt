The UN has repeatedly warned of the ever-increasing severity of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Since the war began, it says, some 85% of Gaza’s 2.3 million residents have been displaced, many repeatedly. Tens of thousands are living in makeshift tents or under plastic sheets. Current UN estimates suggest 60% of homes have been destroyed or damaged, nine in every 10 schools have suffered "significant damage", most hospitals have stopped working and other public facilities, including electricity networks have been hit. When the war began, Israel stopped all imports of food, medicine, power and fuel into Gaza. It has since allowed some aid in, but the UN says the amount is a fraction of what is needed. UN reports have warned famine is imminent, access to safe drinking water is a “struggle” and infectious diseases are spreading rapidly. Displaced Palestinians hold empty pots and buckets as they wait to receive food aid. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
