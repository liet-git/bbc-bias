We will shortly be bringing our coverage of the latest developments in the Middle East to a close, but before we do let's have a quick recap of the key moments from the last 24 hours: Israel came under attack from a wave of drones and missiles in Iran's first direct strikes on its territory. The attack involved more than 300 drones and missiles - the vast majority were intercepted , Israeli's military said. One ballistic missile hit the Nevatim air base in the south of the country, causing minor damage , officials said. Iran said the assault was a response to a deadly attack on an Iranian diplomatic compound in Syria earlier this month. Tehran also warned if Israel retaliated its next response would be bigger. PM Benjamin Netanyahu convened a war cabinet to discuss the attack, which was separately condemned by global leaders including US President Joe Biden, British PM Rishi Sunak and the UN Secretary General. The US President has hosted an online meeting of the G7 leaders while the White House has insisted it does not want to see the crisis in the Middle East escalate. An anti-missile system operates after Iran launched drones and missiles towards Israel, as seen from Ashkelon on 13 April. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
