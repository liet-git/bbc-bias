"Hamas has to believe that Israel is going to attack Rafah. " Those were the words of a Western diplomat, speaking to me anonymously more than two months ago. The point he was making was: unless Hamas believes that the full weight of the Israeli military will eventually be brought to bear on Rafah, it will have no real incentive to strike a deal. Only the prospect of complete annihilation would force Hamas to sue for peace. Has Joe Biden now taken the prospect of a full-scale Rafah operation off the table? This morning, some Israeli commentators are coming to that conclusion. Writing in Yedioth Ahronoth, Avi Issacharoff says that public pressure on Israel has prompted Hamas “not to give up on any of its excessive demands”. "Rafah," he writes, "remains the last bullet in Israel’s magazine in the negotiations". "The problem is that as long as the Americans refuse to support an operation there, it is clear to all the sides that this bullet is a blank. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
