The Qatari media network, Al Jazeera, has said it will be referring the killing of its journalist Samer Abudaqa to the International Criminal Court (ICC), which presides over war crimes. "Al Jazeera affirms its commitment to pursuing all options possible to bring those responsible for the crime of Samerâ€™s assassination to the International Criminal Court," the company said in a statement. Abudaqa was killed by an Israeli drone strike on a school in Khan Younis on Friday, where he and his colleague, Wael Al-Dahdouh were reporting from. Al Jazeera has previously claimed that Israel is "targeting" its journalists and described Abudaqa's death as an "assassination". Israel denies this, and its military told US media that after the strike, it gave permission for an ambulance to attend the scene. The ambulance was dispatched but could not make it because of damaged roads, it added. Al Jazeera has said it will be establishing a group of legal experts to pull together a "comprehensive file" to be submitted to the ICC. Read our full story about his death here.
