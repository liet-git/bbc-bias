The World Central Kitchen (WCK) food aid charity says its aid workers were travelling in three cars in Gaza. BBC Verify has been studying images of three heavily-damaged vehicles. The geolocation was done by matching scenes in the photos with satellite images. One image, for example, shows a Toyota Hilux with a jagged hole in its roof, bearing the WCK logo. A low wall, a pylon, a section of woodland and two distinct roofs can be seen in the background. BBC Verify has matched these features with a part of the coastal road, Al-Rashid, in central Gaza. Separate photos showing a different Toyota Hilux depict palm trees, a distinctive archway and a tall red roofed building in the background. These features place the SUV about 800m further north on the same road, West of Deir al-Balah. A third vehicle is in a patch of open-ground to the south, about 100m off this road. All three vehicles are spread across a distance of just under 2.5kms (1.5 miles). The WCK says its convoy was hit as it was leaving the Deir al-Balah warehouse. One of the images shows a vehicle with a jagged hole in its roof. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
