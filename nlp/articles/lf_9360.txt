We've been receiving some more updates from Rewaa Mohsen , a nurse and mother-of two in Deir al Balah, who told us her plans for the afternoon: Rewaa later followed up to tell us that things didn't go to plan, along with a video of her daughter, eyes wide open looking at the camera. “She refuse bottle milk. I gave her on first month and after that it was not available so she is dependant on breast milk,” she writes in a message. “My mum and only sister were killed in November and I don’t have anyone to help me with them. ”.
