With fighting raging around Khan Younis and in the north, a video is circulating on social media, showing dozens of Palestinian men, stripped to their underwear, kneeling on the ground, being guarded by Israeli soldiers. The men are thought to have been arrested in Beit Lahiya, in the far north of the Gaza Strip. They appear to have been told to remove their shoes, which are seen scattered across the road. Other images show them being transported in military trucks. In the Israeli media, the captives are being described as Hamas fighters who have surrendered. The final image shows the men, bound and blindfolded, kneeling in a large area of bulldozed sand. One well-known Palestinian journalist, Diaa Al-Kahlout, a correspondent for The New Arab,  has been identified among those being held. The New Arab said al-Kahlout had been arrested along with his brothers, relatives “and other civilians”. Israel Defence Forces (IDF) spokesman Daniel Hagari said: “IDF fighters and Shin Bet officers detained and interrogated hundreds of terror suspects. Many of them also turned themselves in to our forces during the past 24 hours. The intelligence coming out of their interrogations is utilised to continue the fighting. ”. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
