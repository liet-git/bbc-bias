Israel’s military is said to have presented a range of options for potential strikes against Iran – with the war cabinet now weighing them up in a meeting scheduled to have begun now. An Israeli source has been briefing the media that Israel cannot allow such a large attack – involving more than 300 drones and missiles, launched directly from Iran for the first time – to pass without some kind of response. Some Israeli politicians argue that a powerful message needs to be sent so that Iran doesn’t repeat its action. However, key figures in the war cabinet have also been stressing the opportunity to strengthen the “strategic alliance” against the threat from Iran – building on the support shown by the US, the UK, Jordan and other allies in thwarting the attack. During the assault, Israel says Iran tried to attack strategically important infrastructure including the Nevatim air force base – where it keeps its stealth fighter jets – but that it failed to have an impact.
