Let's revisit some of the main headlines of the last few hours: Medics      at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis say they are overwhelmed as fighting continues      in the city in southern Gaza. The hospital boss told the BBC his team had "lost      control" as hundreds of dead and wounded people reached the facility. Khan      Younis is surrounded on two fronts by Israeli tanks; the Israeli      military says it's fighting house to house and "shaft to shaft" -      a reference to tunnels allegedly used by its enemy, Hamas. The      death of an Israeli hostage in Gaza has been confirmed by his kibbutz and a      hostages' group, following reports of a failed Israeli rescue mission. The      statement did not mention the cause of Sahar Baruch's death, but said      campaigners would demand the return of his body. The Israeli military has confirmed ground fighting with Hamas has continued in multiple areas of northern Gaza , and that it's targeted Hezbollah targets in neighbouring Lebanon. Reaction      continues to Friday's veto by the US of a resolution at the UN      Security Council that called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in      Gaza . The UK abstained in the vote. A man carries salvaged firewood in the southern Gaza Strip. The death of hostage Sahar Baruch, 25, has been confirmed. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
