A "celebration of life" service has been held in memory of three British aid workers killed in Gaza earlier this month. The memorial event, held at the National Cathedral in Washington DC, America, honoured seven men killed in the Israeli strike on 1 April, including James Kirby, from Bristol, John Chapman from Poole and James Henderson from Cornwall. Mr Kirby was one of seven World Central Kitchen (WCK) workers who died while travelling with a convoy leaving a warehouse in Deir al-Balah, south of Gaza City. The service, held on Thursday, also honoured Palestinian Saifeddin Issam Ayad Abutaha, Jacob Flickinger of the United States and Canada, Lalzawmi Frankcom of Australia and Damian Soból, from Poland. According to the charity WCK, all three vehicles were hit in the air strike, having just unloaded more than 100 tonnes of food aid from overseas. Ahead of the service, WCK founder José Andrés said: "People of all faiths, all gods, together under one roof will be able to hold our heroes in their hearts at the National Cathedral. "Israel has said it will carry out an independent investigation into the incident, after world leaders including USA President Joe Biden condemned the strike. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
