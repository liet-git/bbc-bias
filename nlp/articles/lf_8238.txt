The government’s stand-off with the former Post Office chair Henry Staunton is not going away. Sir Keir Starmer used all six of his questions to ask Rishi Sunak about the allegations from the Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch about Mr Staunton. She said his claims – that he had been told to stall payouts to allow the government to "limp into the election", apparently to help state finances – were "completely false" and accused him of spreading "made-up anecdotes". Some Conservative MPs I’ve spoken to privately questioned the wisdom of Badenoch attacking Staunton so vociferously. Why add oxygen to the row, they asked. It was notable that when Rishi Sunak was repeatedly asked whether he wanted to echo Ms Badenoch’s allegations, he declined to do so. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
