The UK’s Foreign Secretary David Cameron has also welcomed the Israeli decision to open the Kerem Shalom crossing into Gaza. Posting on X, Lord Cameron said: “Very pleased to see Israel’s decision to open Kerem Shalom. This is something the Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, and I, along with our partners, have been strongly advocating for. It’s a vital step towards ensuring significantly more life-saving aid can reach people in Gaza. ”. The Kerem Shalom crossing has been closed since the war started on 7 October but Israel had previously agreed to allow aid lorries to be inspected there before entering into Gaza via the Rafah crossing. It is a goods crossing and isn't used for people to cross in and out of Gaza. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
