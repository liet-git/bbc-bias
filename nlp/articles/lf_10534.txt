The US is the biggest supplier of arms to Israel, helping it build one of the most technologically sophisticated armies in the world. The US accounted for 69% of Israel's imports of major conventional arms between 2019 and 2023, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). Israel also receives $3.8bn (£3bn) in annual military aid from the US under a 10-year agreement that is intended to allow its ally to maintain what it calls a "qualitative military edge" over neighbouring countries. Biden has also said the US would continue to give Israel weapons needed to defend itself including interceptors for its ‘Iron Dome’ air defence system.
