Judge Joan Donoghue has not dismissed the entire case, as Israel has demanded. She said there was sufficient evidence of a dispute between Israel and South Africa and that South Africa has standing to bring the case. She has moved on to examine the question of whether any of the nine provisional measures demanded by South Africa are justified. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
