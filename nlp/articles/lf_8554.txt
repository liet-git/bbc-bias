T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. We’ve heard more from Cogat, the Israeli defence ministry body that co-ordinates humanitarian aid to Gaza. Speaking to the BBC, its spokesman Shimon Friedman says Monday's strike on World Central Kitchen aid workers was a “terrible tragedy” and a “mistake” which “shouldn’t have happened”, adding Israel is taking it “extremely seriously”. Israel has already launched an investigation which is being carried out by an “independent professional body”, he says. Amid calls for other countries to be included in the process, he says he cannot share details of “exactly who is going to be involved”, saying Cogat is not leading it. But he says "full transparency” is “something that we’ve already declared”. He does not directly answer when pressed over whether other countries should be involved, but says: “We want this investigation to be as thorough as possible in order for us to learn whatever needs to be learned so that we can prevent these things from happening again in the future. ”. “We hope for [the investigation to report] in the next few days. And as we’re learning things, we’re trying to implement them already. ”. And on aid, he says: “Israel is continuing to make sure that we are facilitating humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip. ”.
