The potential fallout from the killing of a senior Hamas leader in Lebanon is not yet clear. Saleh al-Arouri died in what Israel has called a "surgical strike against the Hamas leadership" in southern Beirut, along with six others. The Lebanese Foreign Minister, Abdallah Bou Habib, told BBC Radio 4 on Tuesday evening that his government was talking to Hezbollah to "impress on them that they should not respond themselves" but that: "We don't tell them, we dialogue with them in this regard". Over the next 24 hours it will become clear "whether they respond or not", he said, adding: "We are very concerned, [the] Lebanese don't want to be dragged, even Hezbollah does not want to be dragged into a regional war. " And he called on the West to "pressure Israel to stop also all its violence and all of its actions, not only on Lebanon, not only on Beirut, but also in Gaza". Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously vowed to eliminate Hamas's leaders, wherever they are. Saleh al-Arouri (left) masterminded attacks in the occupied West Bank. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
