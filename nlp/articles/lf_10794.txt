A surgeon working for the Doctors Without Borders (MSF) was shot and injured on Monday inside Al-Awda Hospital in northern Gaza, the international medical care charity says. The surgeon was reportedly shot from outside the facility, which MSF says is surrounded by snipers "firing on those inside". "Al-Awda has been under total siege by Israeli forces since 5 December," MSF Ireland's office says. Mohammed Salha, a manager at al-Awda, was earlier quoted by Reuters news agency as saying that Israeli forces had been besieging the facility for days with tanks, shooting people trying to enter or leave. An Israeli military spokesperson said the army followed international law and took "feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm", Reuters reports. The military has also accused Hamas of using medical facilities - a claim denied by the Palestinian group fighting Israel. Al-Awda is one of the last remaining functional hospitals in northern Gaza (image from last month) T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
