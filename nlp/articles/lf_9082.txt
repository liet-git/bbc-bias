T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Israeli government spokesperson David Mencer has been speaking to the BBC: "There is no power in the world that will push us to commit a public suicide, because that's what this is, to stop our war against Hamas. " Israeli cabinet ministers are meeting later to discuss the ruling but government officials have previously said that no power on earth would stop Israel protecting its citizens and pursuing Hamas in Gaza. The Palestinian Authority (PA) - which runs parts of the occupied West Bank - and Hamas - which runs Gaza and attacked nearby Israeli communities on 7 October, sparking the current war - have welcomed the decision. However Hamas says the call to end the offensive should cover all of Gaza and not just Rafah. The ruling "represents an international consensus to end the war on the Gaza Strip," PA presidential spokesperson Nabil Abu Rudeina tells Reuters news agency. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
