Mark Regev, a senior adviser to the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, has also been reacting to the news that UN aid workers may have been involved in the 7 October attacks by Hamas on Israel. He tells the BBC that as well as there being “specific information” about the involvement of UNRWA workers, there is also information that teachers in UNRWA schools “openly celebrated” the attacks. Regev says it is “well-documented” that the aid group has links to Hamas. “I think it’s high time that the UN investigated these links,” he says. Regev adds that the issue links to Friday’s ruling by the ICJ because UNRWA reports were quoted by the chief justice. “No-one should see UNRWA as in any way objective,” says Regev. Mark Regev.
