The amount of aid aid getting into Gaza has increased in the last few days, according to US national security spokesman John Kirby. "And quite dramatically," Kirby has told MSNBC, adding that deliveries must be "sustained". It comes as Cogat, the Israeli government body facilitating aid deliveries to Gaza, says a new crossing has been used to deliver food aid in northern Gaza. It adds that a convoy entered the region via the new northern crossing, and that it helped coordinate 102 food aid trucks to northern Gaza. Earlier this month, in the days that followed seven aid workers being killed in Gaza by an Israeli strike, Kirby told the world's media that the White House expected to see Israel make changes to the situation in Gaza in "the coming hours and days".
