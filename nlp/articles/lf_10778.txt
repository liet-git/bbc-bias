T-I-T-L-E-E-N-D.  T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Turning away from today's court ruling briefly, the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has released updated casualty figures for the territory - it says 200 people were killed there in the last 24 hours. The health ministry says some 25,900 people have now been killed since Israel began its offensive in Gaza following the 7 October attack in which Hamas fighters killed about 1,200 people in southern Israel and took more than 240 hostage. Correction 13 February: This post wrongly reported that about 1,300 people had been killed following the 7 October attack by Hamas. This was based on counting those who later died from their injuries in addition to the figure of more than 1,200. The article has been amended to now refer to about 1,200 deaths, a figure which includes those deaths and which Israel says is not final. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
