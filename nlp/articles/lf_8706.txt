T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. As we've been reporting, the political leader of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, says three of his sons and several of his grandchildren have been killed in an Israeli strike in Gaza. Eyewitnesses say that a car carrying three of Ismail Haniyeh's sons and several of his grandchildren was hit in Al-Shati camp on the beach to the west of Gaza City. They say the members of Haniyeh's family were on their way to visit a family member to celebrate the first day of the Muslim holiday, Eid. Haniyeh received the news in the Qatari capital, Doha, where he lives - as he was visiting Gazans receiving medical treatment. His response was to thank God for the honour bestowed on him by what he called the martyrdom of his sons. He also accused Israel of killing them in order to try to shift Hamas' position in the current ceasefire talks. He said that would not happen. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
