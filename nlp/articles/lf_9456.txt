We've been hearing from Palestinian aid workers and getting their reaction to the seven World Central Kitchen staff who were killed in Gaza. Naser Qadous is Palestinian and works for humanitarian organisation Anera. He knew Damian Sobol and Zomi Frankcom, two of the aid workers who were killed. Naser tells the BBC World Service’s OS programme that “Zomi Frankcom was energetic, always smiling and very friendly and helpful. She was so motivated to help people and had a special character". Naser is currently working in Ramallah in the West Bank, where he says distributing aid is difficult because after 7 October, most of the roads are closed. “Ramallah is not safe too. We’re 100 kilometres from projects in Jenin – it takes five hours now and used to take an hour and a half to get there,” he says. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
