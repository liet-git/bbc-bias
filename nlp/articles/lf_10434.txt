Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has denounced the college protests across the US. "What’s happening in America’s college campuses is horrific," he said on Wednesday, describing the pro-Palestinian protesters as "antisemitic mobs" taking over "leading universities". "They attack Jewish students. They attack Jewish faculty," Netanyahu said. "It has to be condemned and condemned unequivocally. But that’s not what happened. The response of several university presidents was shameful. " Though the protests have largely been peaceful, there are reports of increasing antisemitism on campuses, which has led the White House and multiple lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to condemn the hatred. Some Jewish students at the University of Columbia told the BBC they didn’t feel safe, but others have said they support the demonstrations. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
