Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu has accused Western countries of a two-faced attitude to Hamas - his enemy in Gaza. “You cannot on the one hand support the elimination of Hamas and on other pressure us to end the war, which would prevent the elimination of Hamas," he said while briefing his cabinet today. Netanyahu told his colleagues that he said as much to the leaders of France, Germany and "other leaders". His comments came two days after 13 members of UN Security Council supported a resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire . The US vetoed the move, while the UK abstained on its vote. Netanyahu also thanked the US for both the veto and its military aid. On Saturday, the Biden administration used an emergency law to bypass Congress and authorise the sale of some 14,000 rounds of tank ammunition worth more than $106m (£85m) to Israel. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
