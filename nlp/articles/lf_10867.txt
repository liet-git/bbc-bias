T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. There are more lines to bring you from Qatar - but first, a look at the latest scenes in southern Gaza. The bombardment continues on Khan Younis, where Israeli forces have ordered civilians to leave the centre of the city. Desperate Palestinians, packed in trucks, tractors or sometimes even horse- or donkey-carts, are fleeing. Many take Salah Al-Din road, one of the main arteries in southern Gaza. They must navigate the craters and rubble following Israeli strikes. Those who arrive in Rafah are forced to take shelter in tents and other makeshift housing, which stretch out into the distance.
