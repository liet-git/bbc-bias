The head of Israel's intelligence agency is expected to hold talks with Qatari and Egyptian mediators in Qatar later today on a possible ceasefire and release of hostages in Gaza. An Israeli official said that the Mossad chief, David Barnea, would discuss a proposal for a six-week truce during which forty hostages would be freed. The official said this stage of the negotiations could take at least two weeks - due in part to difficulties that Hamas delegates may have in communicating with the group's leaders inside Gaza. Earlier this month, weeks of intense negotiations involving Qatari, US and Egyptian mediators failed to secure a truce between Israel and Hamas for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which began last week.
