As we continue to cover the return of Palestinians to the destroyed city of Khan Younis this morning, it's worth recalling some of the major developments that happened in the last week of the Israel-Gaza war: An Israeli air strike on a convoy of charity workers in Gaza, who were leaving a warehouse after unloading aid, killed seven World Central Kitchen (WCK) aid workers. Speaking to ABC News in the US on Sunday night, WCK founder Jose Andres reiterated his belief that the attack was targeted. Andres once again hit out at the wider actions of Israel, saying: "This doesn't seem a war against terror, this doesn't seem any more a war about defending Israel. . . this seems a war against humanity itself" Six of the seven aid workers killed in the strike were foreigners, sparking outrage from the international community. US President Joe Biden warned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a call that Israel must take steps to prevent civilian harm and humanitarian suffering if it wanted its strongest ally to continue its support. National Security spokesman John Kirby has doubled-down on the US's position, telling ABC News on Sunday that the Biden administration has "made clear" changes need to be made in the way the Israeli Defense Forces are prosecuting operations in Gaza. Israel has also approved the reopening of two humanitarian routes into Gaza so as to allow more aid into the besieged enclave. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
