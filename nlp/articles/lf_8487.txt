Following Israel's announcement that it will allow aid to get into Gaza through the Kerem Shalom crossing - for the first time since the war began - the World Health Organization's representative in the enclave says more needs to be done. It's good news, Richard Peeperkorn, told the BBC but he said there now needs to be a focus on making sure aid "trucks can go everywhere in Gaza - not just the south". Peeperkorn said there were hospitals "barely functional" in the north - and "regular supplies" were needed there as a result, adding: How do we make sure that we can get regular supplies and . . . help to expend the number of beds, get emergency medical teams linked to those places? At the moment, that is not possible, because of the lack of security, the difficult routings. . . " Ultimately, Peeperkorn said, "we are not only talking about getting supplies into Gaza, weâ€™re talking about getting supplies to the people all over Gaza". Previously aid had only been able to enter Gaza through the Rafah border crossing from Egypt, which can only process a limited number of vehicles. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
