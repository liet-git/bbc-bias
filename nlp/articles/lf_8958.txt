Laura now turns to the Israel-Gaza war, which started six months ago. Stoltenberg recently condemned the strikes which killed seven World Central Kitchen (WCK) aid workers in Gaza. Laura asks if he believes Israel has gone too far? Stoltenberg believes it is “very important Nato allies, including the US, convey a very clear message to Israel that they have to do more, significantly more, to protect civilians and to protect aid workers”. He also welcomes efforts by the US, UK and others to facilitate an agreement on a ceasefire. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
