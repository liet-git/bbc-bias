UK-based charity Oxfam describes the ICJ ruling as a "critical intervention to stop Israel's military onslaught on Rafah", and says Israel must "immediately comply" and halt its "brutal offensive". Sally Abi-Khalil, the aid organisation's Middle East regional director, calls on the Israeli authorities to "release its stranglehold on the aid pipeline" and allow in some 4,500 trucks carrying food, water and medicine that are currently stuck in al-Arish, the Egyptian city closest to Gaza. She also urges countries to stop supplying weapons to Israel "immediately", saying if they continue they are defying the ICJ ruling and "complicit in any war crimes committed in Gaza". Israel has insisted it is facilitating the entry of aid and has blamed aid agencies for failing to distribute the supplies that enter Gaza. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
