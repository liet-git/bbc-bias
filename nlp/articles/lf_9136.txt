White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre is pressed further by a reporter on the alleged Israeli attack against Iran. The journalist suggests this level of silence is "really new" for the Biden administration and asks Jean-Pierre whether this was part of a strategy to de-escalate. Jean-Pierre says she understands the interest, but adds: "I just don't have anything to share. " On efforts around de-escalation, she says the US does not want to see the tensions escalate and that was a "sentiment" expressed earlier at the meeting of G7 leaders in Capri, Italy. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
