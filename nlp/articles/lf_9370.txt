Earlier, we heard from Yahya Hussen, a fashion designer living in Deir al Balah, who told us how food prices in Gaza have become "astronomical". The price of water, which is reported to be in very short supply, has gone up by 200%. A box of eggs now costs 100 shekels (Â£21) - a price increase of more than 560%. The prices seen in the graphic below reflect the average increases in Gaza, but many people in the enclave are paying much more to avoid queues or if items have limited availability. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
