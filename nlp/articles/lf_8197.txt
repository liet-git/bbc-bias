The House's principal constitutional adviser has warned the Speaker that "long-established conventions are not being followed" by allowing Labour's amendment to be debated today. In a letter to Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the clerk of the House of Commons, Tom Goldsmith, says the decision could prevent a vote on the SNP's own motion, or the government's. But he acknowledges that the Speaker and his deputies have "complete discretion" when deciding which amendments to select. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
