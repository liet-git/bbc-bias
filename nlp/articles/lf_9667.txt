T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. The vote at the United Nations is a key diplomatic development. For the first time in this war, the Security Council is calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. Crucially, it marks a shift in the US position: the Americans did not veto the resolution, as they had done on three earlier occasions. This is another sign of the huge frustration of the Biden administration with the way Israel has been conducting its campaign, which has faced intense international criticism. Unsurprisingly, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu immediately criticised the US after the vote, saying the abstention was a clear departure from the American position, as the resolution did not condition the ceasefire with the release of hostages still being held in Gaza. Netanyahu cancelled the trip of an Israeli delegation to Washington, intended to explain to American officials the plans of the military for an offensive into the southern city of Rafah, where more than one million Palestinians have been sheltering after being forced to leave other parts of the territory. The US and other countries, as well as the UN and aid organisations, say any incursion will lead to a humanitarian disaster. Netanyahu, however, has vowed to go ahead, with or without American support, saying this is the only way to defeat Hamas. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
