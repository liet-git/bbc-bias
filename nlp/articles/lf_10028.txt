T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Iran took a big risk with its attacks on Israel using more than 300 drones, cruise missiles and ballistic missiles. The best outcome for Iran’s military planners is if Israel decides not to retaliate. Iran does not have strong or sophisticated missile defence systems that cover the whole of the country, and similar attacks by Israel on Iran could cause extensive casualties and damage. Nonetheless, Iran seems to have decided to put its relations with Israel on a new footing. Iran entered into direct military conflict with Israel for the first time after nearly 45 years – that is a major shift and signals that Iran, under pressure from its own hardliners, and public opinion in the Arab world, has decided that it can no longer hide behind its proxies, and will have to manage its hostility towards Israel more openly.
