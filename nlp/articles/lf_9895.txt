Just a day ago, US President Joe Biden told Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that a “military operation in Rafah should not proceed” without an effective plan to ensure the safety and support of the many civilians sheltering in the city. Overnight, Israeli forces carried out strikes in Rafah, which the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza say killed 67 people. The US has continued to reiterate the widely declared shared goal of defeating Hamas, but in recent weeks the Biden administration has been increasingly critical of how Israeli military is carrying out its operations. And last Thursday, the US president said the “conduct of the response” by Israel in Gaza was “over the top”. Later on Monday, Biden will meet with King Abdullah II of Jordan, at the White House, to discuss efforts to free hostages in Gaza and their concerns regarding military operations in Rafah. The meeting will be their first since US troops were killed in a drone strike on a US base in Jordan. The US blames Iran-backed militia for the deadly attack. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
