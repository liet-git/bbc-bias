The SNP's Patricia Gibson , MP for North Ayrshire and Arran, asks whether MPs should be able to vote according to their consciences on life and death matters? She's referring to a vote later today in the Commons on calls for a ceasefire in the Israel-Gaza conflict. Sunak flags that he has called for an immediate humanitarian pause but "just calling for an immediate full ceasefire now, which collapses back into fighting in days or weeks will not be in anyone's interest". He adds: "We are committed. . . to finding a lasting resolution to this conflict, which delivers on the promise of a two-state solution. " Calling for Gaza ceasefire now 'not in anyone’s interest’ - Sunak. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
