T-I-T-L-E-E-N-D.  T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. We've just heard from the UK's former ambassador to Lebanon, Tom Fletcher, who has told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the picture is still "quite hazy" and many across the region are "waking up with real fear". "This is a sign that Israel does intend to continue this game of high-stakes poker with Iran," he says. Fletcher added that diplomats across the region, as well as the US and UK, "will all be looking to find ways to play it down now". "We don't know how much of an escalation this is for now. Clearly Iran is starting to signal that it is not necessarily a major escalation. They are playing it down. And of course Israel could have chosen to do something more dramatic," he says. Fletcher goes on to say Israel is "clearly saying" to Iran that it can "dial it up" and that nuclear sites are not off-limits, despite Iran attempting to signal in the last few days "you don't go near the nuclear sites". "The danger in all of this of course is that there is risk of miscalculation," Fletcher says. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
