We're currently watching events in Dublin and Madrid, as both countries simultaneously announce plans to recognise Palestinian statehood. In Dublin, the Irish PM says the country believes that "permanent peace can only be secured upon the basis of the free will of a free people". Simon Harris pointed to a vote earlier this month at the United Nations General Assembly - where 143 nations voted in favour of a resolution granting Palestine enhanced status within the organisation. He adds: "Palestinians in Gaza are enduring the most appalling, suffering, hardship and starvation. "A humanitarian catastrophe, unimaginable to most, and unconscionable to all - is unfolding in real time. " Simon Harris (centre) in Dublin. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
