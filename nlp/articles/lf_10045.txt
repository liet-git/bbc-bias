 F-N-S-T-A-R-T. 10045 F-N-E-N-D.  D-A-T-E-S-T-A-R-T. 2024-04-14 D-A-T-E-E-N-D.  T-I-T-L-E-S-T-A-R-T. Where is Biden today? T-I-T-L-E-E-N-D.  T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. I've just arrived at the White House. It would normally be quiet here on a Sunday morning - but today there's a noticeable uptick in activity as reporters do live appearances for TV and radio outside or make phone calls and watch morning talk shows from their desks in the press area. Getting inside was slightly more challenging than it usually is for me. As I arrived here this morning, staff were putting up metal barriers to keep the public away, forcing me to show my "hard pass" to move past uniformed Secret Service agents. As of now, there's been no word about President Biden's plans today. He was originally slated to be in Delaware - where he usually spends his weekends - until tonight, but last night he abruptly returned to meet with his national security team as the situation in the Middle East unfolded. While his plan remains unclear, much of his focus, US officials have said, will be on de-escalating and preventing the conflict from widening in the coming hours and days. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
