People "not affiliated" with Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, have been arrested after setting up an encampment on school grounds, the school's president says. Emory University President Gregory Fenves says several dozen protesters - "largely unaffiliated" with the university - entered the campus and were "disrupting" students in class. "This is completely unacceptable," Fenves says. An official from the school's police force told local news that those arrested will be charged with criminal trespass and assaulting police officers. "The ones that were arrested, there wasn't anything peaceful about what was going on," Emory police Commander Thomas Mann told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution newspaper. But not everyone detained on Thursday was unaffiliated with the university. On X, formerly Twitter, video is circulating showing a woman who identifies herself as Noelle McAfee, chairwoman of the philosophy department at Emory University, being led away by an Atlanta Police officer.
