T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. A ceasefire deal between Hamas and Israel is the ultimate political prize for the White House. President Biden is under huge pressure from all sides over the war in Gaza. Some traditional Democrat supporters are extremely unhappy with the Biden administration’s support for the Israelis. America is Israel’s most important supplier of arms, and many here are calling for conditions to be attached to arms deliveries – or for them to be stopped completely. This view is especially prevalent among young people and ethnic minorities – crucial groups that Biden must win over if he has any chance of holding on to the White House during this November’s presidential election. University campuses across the US have been rocked by pro-Palestinian protests in the past few weeks. Some of them have turned violent – leading to accusations that Biden has overseen a breakdown in law and order. Many Republicans in Congress and Jewish groups say the protests are antisemitic and a threat to the safety of Jewish students. Joe Biden has spoken of his frustration over Israel’s conduct of the war and has urged Netanyahu not to go ahead with a military operation in Rafah. If a full-scale offensive does go ahead, that would be a humiliating blow to Biden. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
