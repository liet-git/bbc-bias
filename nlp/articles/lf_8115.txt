Here's a brief rundown of the events in the Commons that have sparked such controversy: Sir Lindsay Hoyle sparked fury on the SNP and Tory benches when he broke with convention to allow a vote on a Labour motion for an "immediate humanitarian ceasefire" The row erupted on a day which had been designated an SNP opposition day , meaning they could put forward motions for debate and vote. The Speaker later said he came to this decision so that MPs could express their view on "the widest range of propositions", but was accused of allowing Labour to hijack the debate. His decision meant Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer avoided another potential rebellion over the party's position on Gaza, after suffering a major revolt in November. It also meant there was no vote on the SNP's motion for an "immediate ceasefire" This sparked fury, with some SNP and Tory MPs seen walking out of the chamber. Hoyle also faces calls to resign, with 33 MPs signing a motion declaring they have no confidence in him. Watch: Chaos in the Commons over Gaza ceasefire vote. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
