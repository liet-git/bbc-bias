The intense bombardment of towns and cities in Gaza, including Khan Younis and Rafah in the south, by Israeli forces is continuing. Palestinian health officials say four people, including two children, were killed and several others wounded in an Israeli air strike on a house in Khan Younis early this morning, with reports of other wounded Palestinians being taken to Nasser hospital in the city. Palestinian news agency WAFA said overnight Israeli airstrikes also killed and injured people in Rafah. One of the strikes is said to have hit a housing block near the Kuwaiti hospital in the city. Thick, black plumes of smoke could be seen in southern Gaza from Israel after dawn on Friday. The cause of the smoke was not immediately known. Many Gazans fled towards Rafah after Israel urged them to leave parts of Khan Younis - where hundreds of thousands had already fled from north Gaza earlier in the fighting. Israel believes Hamas leaders are hiding out in the south of the Gaza Strip. Smoke rising above Khan Younis this morning. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
