Speaking in Brussels, Lord Cameron says he welcomes Israel pledging a full, urgent and transparent inquiry. He spoke to his Israeli counterpart, Israel Katz, after the death of three UK citizens. Lord Cameron says that Katz had talked about getting more aid into Gaza - including up to 500 trucks a day. "We've been promised these things before - this really needs to happen," Lord Cameron says. He adds that the UK would watch "very closely" to ensure aid workers could travel safely around Gaza. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
