The SNP's Patricia Gibson is making a bold claim relating to the allegations of interference by Sir Keir Starmer, which he has in the last hour denied. She says the Labour leadership are the subject of "grave allegations" of "engaging in dark practices" and "possibly even of blackmail", which she says led to the break in parliamentary convention. A chorus of "what?" echoes around the House as Gibson says this. She asks for Mordaunt to give her opinion on there being full disclosure on the conversations that took place between Sir Lindsay Hoyle and Starmer prior to the debate yesterday. She also asks for another Opposition day for the SNP to air their views on the Israel-Gaza war. Mordaunt says Gibson has her views on the record, and will talk to the SNP leader, but doesn't specify exactly which request of Gibson's she will raise. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
