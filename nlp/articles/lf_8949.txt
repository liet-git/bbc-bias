After two weeks of talks, the UN Security Council is today due to vote on a much-delayed resolution concerning humanitarian aid for Gaza. And the US has expressed support for the latest draft. The vote had been in limbo after Washington voiced "widespread concerns" with a draft, but last night US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield called it a "very strong" resolution that "we can support". She did not, however, say outright if the US will vote in favour or abstain. All week, the Security Council has postponed the resolution aimed at bringing in some form of ceasefire, as wrangling continued over the language. The original draft called for a sustainable cessation of hostilities, but the final version calls for creating the conditions for one. And it no longer calls for the use of all land, sea and air routes for deliveries - just all available routes. The key sticking point yesterday appeared to be over the text's proposal to have a UN mechanism to monitor aid into Gaza, with the US saying this could take away Israel's control of the screening process. Currently, Israel monitors all aid and fuel deliveries to Gaza. You can read more on all this here. US Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield told reporters the latest draft has US support.
