This week’s Prime Minister’s Questions were overshadowed by something that went unnoticed by many MPs at the beginning of the session, Labour welcoming an extra body while the government benches were reduced by one. Natalie Elphicke, who represents Dover, followed Dan Poulter in leaving the Tories with a withering assessment of Rishi Sunak’s government. Elphicke said her decision had been driven by concerns over housing and border security, accused Rishi Sunak of "broken promises" and abandoning key pledges and said the Tories "have become a byword for incompetence and division". She was welcomed onto the Labour benches by Sir Keir Starmer who asked PM Sunak "what is the point of this failed government staggering on" when "the Tory MP for Dover on the front line of small boats crisis says the prime minister cannot be trusted with our borders and joins Labour". Some Tory MPs were bemused by the defection, as Elphicke was regarded as being on the right of the party, and Transport Minister Huw Merriman accused Elphicke of being "opportunistic".
