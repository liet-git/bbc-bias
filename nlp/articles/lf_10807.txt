Mark Regev, senior adviser to Israel's prime minister, told the BBC earlier that “hitting them [Hamas] hard” with military pressure is the best way to get the remaining 135 Israeli hostages released. “[Hamas] release hostages because they are desperate for time out in the fighting,” he says. Mediator Qatar has said the bombardment of Gaza means the window for a new truce is narrowing, but Regev says this is “wrong", adding that the only way to facilitate the release of hostages is military pressure. He says Israel has "grave concerns about hostages who remain captive with Hamas", referencing how Hamas "brutalised and raped" civilians during the 7 October attacks. Regev adds that Israel has designated “humanitarian safer” areas on maps and says “the people of Gaza know where these areas are" - though Gazans have said they struggle to access online maps with intermittent internet coverage, while aid agencies say nowhere is safe in Gaza. Israel has called for specific areas of Khan Younis to be evacuated, but not the city in its entirety. Regev says Israel disagrees with diplomatic calls for a ceasefire because that would mean “Hamas stays in power” and “Hamas has said the 7 October attacks would happen again".
