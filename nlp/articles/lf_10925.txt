It's the bleakest of milestones, with little sign that after six months, the war is likely to end any time soon. On the streets of Tel Aviv and other Israeli towns and cities on Saturday night, the anger and despair were palpable as tens of thousands once more demanded that their government do a deal to free the hostages. Their pleas were made more urgent by the discovery by Israeli commandos in Gaza of the body of one of the hostages, Elad Katzir. His sister blamed his death on the failure to reach a second ceasefire deal. Talks are once again expected to resume today in Cairo - delegations from Hamas and Israel are due to attend, while high-profile mediators, including the head of the CIA and Qatar's foreign minister, are there too. But the positions of both sides still seem far apart. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
