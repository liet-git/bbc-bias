Not all students are taking part in the demonstrations. One of those is Columbia freshman Jacob. He saw the group from afar on Tuesday, and says since the police were called, "everything has blown up". "That was pouring gasoline on the fire," he says of the decision to call in law enforcement. "I wish our administration had maybe worked with them a little more to hear their demands," he adds. Jacob says he has Jewish friends who feel uncomfortable on campus and he empathises with them.
