The US is still formulating its response to the court’s ruling. I’ve just been on a reporters call with James O’Brien, US Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian affairs. The call was to announce a trip to Europe next week by Secretary of State Antony Blinken. I asked if the administration had a response to the ICJ ruling, but the official moderating the call said they “may need to get back” separately on that, while O’Brien joked that the moderator was “forbidding” him from commenting, before adding: “I don’t know. ”. All major US policy decisions on Israel are made by one person - President Biden. There will be a form of words, likely being put together now by Biden’s National Security Council at the White House, and bounced around top officials in the State Department and Pentagon. The US has previously said it wouldn’t support a full scale military offensive by Israel on Rafah, but has stopped short so far of viewing the current assault in those terms, instead calling it a “limited operation”. When asked previously about South Africa’s case, the White House has said it “firmly” rejects the contention that what is happening in Gaza is a genocide. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
