T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. I visited an informal camp set up by displaced families in al-Attar area to the west of Rafah. It is largely made of families who could not find space in UN schools or shelters. People here are visibly exhausted and angry. Everyone complains of a lack of aid, food and even bathrooms. Outside one tent sit a group of men. One of them is lying on a thin, shabby mattress. "He’s injured but we can’t find him shelter," one man says. “We need a solution. Protect us,” he pleads. As we walk around the dozens of tents, we see families cooking bread and other food over a wood fire. Children play with whatever they can find. I see two girls filling empty plastic bottles with sand. Two more girls lie on their stomach in the dirt, their heads resting on an old pillow. I cannot describe the desperation people feel.
