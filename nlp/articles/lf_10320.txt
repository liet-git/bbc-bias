The situation regarding a Gaza ceasefire is "very murky" at the moment, according to international affairs think tank Chatham House. "I can only imagine how the families of Israel hostages as well as all the people in Gaza are feeling on this rollercoaster," Dr Lina Khatib, an associate fellow at the think tank, tells BBC 5 Live Breakfast. "Diplomatic efforts are being stepped up by Egypt, by Qatar and by the US. It’s also positive that Benjamin Netanyahu that Israel will send negotiations back to Cairo," she added ahead of talks continuing today. When asked if any concessions were on the table, she says that it remains unclear. "There are unconfirmed reports that Hamas effectively wants a long-term end to ‘hostile activity'. . . if this is long-term or forever as an unnamed Palestinian official supposedly said, this would be a game changing situation because it means Hamas are accepting only playing a political role. " "We’ll have to wait and see," she adds. Khatib says that Israel wants to put more pressure on Hamas to accept their terms. "Unfortunately, civilians always suffer in this scenario. It is likely still the US is going to exert more pressure on Israel to prevent the current attack on Rafah from expanding," she says. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
