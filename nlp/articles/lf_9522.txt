The World Food Programme's (WFP) county director for Palestine, Matthew Hollingworth, has been telling the BBC about the "massive amount of work" that goes into aid groups organising the simplest of tasks in Gaza in order to reduce risks. He says this sometimes involves co-ordination with the Israeli military, through what's known as "deconflicting". This includes providing details from GPS co-ordinates, to descriptions of the places they plan to work. He said the World Central Kitchen "has been notifying every time its personnel move, and it has been co-ordinating when it’s in very close proximity to front lines and troop movements". "There is going to have to be a full, very high-level scale investigation by the IDF on what happened, what went wrong. They’re going to have to dissect exactly what they were told and why it wasn’t successful in keeping these humanitarians safe. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
