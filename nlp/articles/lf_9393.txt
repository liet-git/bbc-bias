We're now going to bring our coverage of this morning's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg show to a close. As we've been reporting, the ongoing conflict in the Middle East and Natalie Elphicke's defection to Labour featured prominently on this week's show. There's plenty to read across the BBC which delves into these topics: UK ban on selling arms to Israel would strengthen Hamas, says Cameron. Foreign Office investigating Hamas claim British-Israeli hostage killed in Gaza. Natalie Elphicke accused of lobbying over husband's sexual assault case. Kuenssberg's analysis: What could go wrong for Keir Starmer? A lot actually. This page was written by Ece Goksedef and Thomas Mackintosh, and was edited by Marita Moloney. Thanks for joining us.
