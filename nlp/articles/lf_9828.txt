Blinken says the daily toll on civilians in Gaza, particularly on children, is far too high. He notes that 90% of Gaza's population continues to face acute food insecurity according to the UN, and this has lifelong consequences for children. He says he noted in meetings today that more essential aid needs to be allowed into Gaza and there needs to be more effective distribution within Gaza. He says Israel needs to do everything it can to remove obstacles and facilitate that. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
