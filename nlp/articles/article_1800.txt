A British-Israeli teenager has been killed in Gaza while serving in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). Binyamin Needham, 19, reportedly moved from England to Israel with his family when he was eight-years-old. He is at least the second UK citizen to have died while serving in the Israeli military during the current conflict. Mr Needham's sister told Israeli media her brother was "always smiling, always loving" and had only recently completed his training. Speaking to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, sister Orly said:  "He was so proud, and he had just finished basic training. He was happy to defend the country. " She told Israeli public broadcaster Kan News Mr Needham was "happy to be in the army and to be protecting the Jewish people and our homeland", adding: "We are so, so proud of him. " Mr Needham's death was confirmed by the IDF in a statement, which said he had been posthumously promoted to the rank of sergeant.  He was one of three fatalities confirmed by the Israeli military on Monday, taking its death toll to 75 since the current conflict between Israel and Gaza broke out. An IDF statement said Mr Needham was serving with the Combat Engineering Corps and "fell in battle in the northern Gaza Strip". Nathanel Young, 20, was the first British solider serving with the IDF to be killed. He died on 7 October near the border with Gaza, his family said.
