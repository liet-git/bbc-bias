SNP MP Pete Wishart has been speaking about his disappointment at today’s events in the House of Commons. His party’s motion calling for a ceasefire in Gaza was scuppered by Westminster party politics. The MP for Perth and North Perthshire told the PA news agency he was “appalled and horrified”. "The debate was hijacked by the Labour Party," he said. He said observers would be "disgusted at what they've seen. This was a day that deserved and required some serious attention. . . and what they got was an absolute circus. " He said he had never seen anything like it in his time as an MP. “I've been through Iraq, through the whole dramas when it came to the independence referendum, through Brexit, and there has never been a day quite like this.
