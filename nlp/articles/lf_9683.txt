We're bringing our live coverage to an end soon. To recap, a little while ago US President Joe Biden spoke from the White House and outlined the terms of a proposal he said Israel has put forward to end the conflict in Gaza. Here's the key points: The proposal is made up of three phases, starting with a six-week ceasefire, which if certain conditions were met, would become permanent and then be followed by the rebuilding of Gaza - see our earlier post for the details. He urged Hamas to "take the deal", and called on the Israeli leadership to "stand behind" it. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu's office said it has authorised a negotiating team to "present an outline" for achieving the release of hostages. In a statement, the Israeli PM's office said the conditional phased outline would allow it to maintain its war aims, including the "elimination" of Hamas's armed wing and organisational capacities. We have not yet heard from representatives of Hamas. To get the full view of the Israeli ceasefire plan and Biden's comments about it, read our story here.
