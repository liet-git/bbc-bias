T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Amal Clooney - who was involved in the ICC's decision - has welcomed today's statement. Clooney, a renowned human rights lawyer, says she was approached by the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Karim Khan, more than four months ago to help evaluate evidence. Clooney - along with others of what she calls "diverse personal backgrounds" - unanimously determined "the Court has jurisdiction over crimes committed in Palestine and Palestinian nationals". "As a human rights lawyer, I will never accept that one child’s life has less value than another’s," Clooney says. "I do not accept that any conflict should be beyond the reach of the law, nor that any perpetrator should be above the law. So I support the historic step that the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court has taken to bring justice to victims of atrocities in Israel and Palestine. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
