T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. RAF Typhoon jets have been flying over areas of Iraq and Syria tonight and have been authorised to target any Iranian drones and missiles flying within range. At present, the UK Ministry of Defence is not saying how many Typhoons have been airborne or whether they have intercepted any targets. The MoD statement makes clear that RAF jets have been flying in the same areas theyâ€™ve been conducting counter IS missions as part of Operation Shader - for several years. They are not flying over Israel. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
