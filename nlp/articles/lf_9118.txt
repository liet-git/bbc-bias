The situation in the strategically vital southern Red Sea is now at a standoff. Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels have issued defiant statements vowing to continue their attacks on any vessel passing their coast that they consider has links to Israel. Their actions have now been unanimously condemned by the UN and, perhaps more significantly, a statement late on Wednesday by the US and 11 other nations implicitly warns the Houthis to stop or "bear the consequences". In practice, this is likely to mean armed action against their bases, boats and weapons if the attacks on shipping persist. US, British and French warships in the Red Sea all have the capability to shoot down Houthi missiles and drones but this is getting expensive and they can’t be sure to hit every single one, especially if the Houthis decide to launch a ‘swarm’ attack: launching multiple drones and missiles at once, as Russia has been doing in Ukraine. Yemen may be the poorest Arab nation but the Houthis have a large stockpile of missiles and drones and they are showing no sign of backing down. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
