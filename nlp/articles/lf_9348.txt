We've been hearing all day from medical student Nagham Atef Mezied , 22, in Deir al Balah. She sent us this recent update on conditions inside the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, where she is volunteering: The hospital is overflowing with displaced people seeking shelter. It has become a refuge for those who have lost everything â€“ their homes, their loved ones, their sense of security. Some sleep in makeshift shelters and tents on the hospital grounds. Others find solace in the narrow corridors. Within these crowded walls we also have contagious diseases such as influenza, hepatitis, lice, and scabies spreading unchecked, fuelled by the cramped conditions and lack of proper sanitation. The scarcity of even the most basic medical equipment and supplies further compounds the challenges faced by the dedicated healthcare workers. Nagham sent us this photo of the scene at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
