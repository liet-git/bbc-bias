Funerals are expected to take place shortly for six Palestinians killed in an Israeli raid of al-Fara refugee camp near Tubas in the north of the occupied West Bank. The Israeli military has not yet responded to requests for comments. Witnesses in the camp said that Israeli special undercover forces entered the camp in the early hours of this morning. One man said that his relative had been shot dead after opening a door to see what was happening. A small local armed group operates from the camp. According to the Palestinian Authority, 263 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces and settlers in the West Bank since the war in Gaza began. That exceeds the entire death toll of Palestinians killed in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict last year. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
