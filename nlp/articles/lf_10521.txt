The UK should follow the US in threatening to withdraw military aid to Israel if they begin a ground offensive in Rafah, a Conservative MP has told the BBC. Speaking to the World at One programme, James Sunderland said the UK needs to review what it is supplying to the country. Israel's "right to self-defence comes with responsibility", he added. "The Israelis have been suffering from this proscribed terrorist organisation for a long time. But unchecked anger is a dangerous thing and what the Israelis need to do is remove Hamas as a military, terrorist threat," he said. He went on to say that Israel must not do this by targeting civilians. Military vehicles gather in southern Israel, near the Gaza border. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
