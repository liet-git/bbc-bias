The Israeli defence ministry body overseeing policy for the Palestinian territories, Cogat, has published a video which it says shows Hamas gunmen "violently" seizing a humanitarian aid convoy and shooting at civilians. The video shows hooded figures standing on the back of several lorries, shooting at people as they drive past. It's unclear what part of Gaza the video is filmed in, and the BBC is working to verify its accuracy. Israel opened the Kerem Shalom goods crossing with Gaza on Tuesday for security checks on aid shipments delivered via Rafah. However, the UN says its ability to receive incoming aid is being significantly undermined by a shortage of lorries within Gaza; the lack of fuel; telecommunications blackouts; and the increasing number of staff unable to reach the Rafah crossing safely because of the intensity of hostilities in the south. Aid distribution has also largely stopped outside the Rafah area becauser of the fighting. Israel has severely limited supplies of fuel, arguing that it could be stolen by Hamas and used for military purposes. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
