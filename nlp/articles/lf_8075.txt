We'll have more from the exchange between the SNP's Stephen Flynn and Sir Linday Hoyle shortly, but can bring you some other speakers from the session for now. Before Flynn raised his question there was a rare moment of solidarity in the House of Commons as Labour's Stephen Doughty acknowledged Tory Mark Francois and his track record of taking MPs concerns on board. Moving on to the constituencies he represents, Cardiff South and Penarth, Doughty said the public are concerned about the scenes they have witnessed on the ground in Gaza. He also asked for guidance on support for people who have duel-citizenship and might also have relatives living in the besieged enclave. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
