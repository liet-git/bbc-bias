Returning Palestinians have described the scene in Khan Younis as if the city had been hit by an earthquake. Many have found their homes reduced to rubble. Gaza's second city was the focus of Israeli troops for months. It said it believed that the Hamas leadership was hiding out there. Israel says it did all it could to protect civilians. But the casualties were high and hundreds of thousands were displaced. One Palestinian told the BBC, though, that he would rather live in a tent above the rubble of his home than be displaced or forced into exile. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
