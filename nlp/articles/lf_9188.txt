T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. A senior Iranian official tells Reuters news agency "Iran has no plan for immediate retaliation against Israel," hours after an attack on the Iranian city of Isfahan, that is reported to have been conducted by Israel. Two US officials told media the attack came from Israel, but Israel has not claimed responsibility so far. "The foreign source of the incident has not been confirmed. We have not received any external attack, and the discussion leans more towards infiltration than attack," the Iranian official said on condition of anonymity. Only about an hour ago, an Iranian analyst told Iranian state TV that "Mini drones shot down by air defences in Isfahan were flown by infiltrators from inside Iran", downplaying the reports that Israel had conducted the attack.
