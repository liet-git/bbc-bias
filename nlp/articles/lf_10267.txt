It's just gone midday in Israel and Gaza, where fighting between the Israeli military and Hamas continues. If you're just joining us, or need a recap, here's a round-up of the latest developments: Israel's ambassador to the UK has said the country will not accept a two-state solution after the war in Gaza ends. "The Palestinians never wanted to have a state next to Israel," Tzipi Hotovely told Sky News. The two-state solution is the idea that establishing an independent Palestine alongside Israel would create a way for the two peoples to co-exist peacefully. The policy is supported by the United States and other allies of Israel. White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan is on his way to Israel, where he's scheduled to hold talks with Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu about a need for more precise strikes against targets in Gaza. The health ministry in Gaza, which is run by Hamas, says 18,600 people have been killed in the enclave since the start of the war. The health ministry ministry said at least 19 people were killed this morning in Gaza as a result of Israeli air strikes. And in the West Bank, Israel's military operation in Jenin is continuing for a third day - 11 Palestinians have been killed and many more injured. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
