T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Liz Saville-Roberts, an MP of Plaid Cymru, starts her comments by saying that everyone in the House knows what is unfolding in Rafah. She talks of an "irrevocable disaster" in a refugee camp the size of Cardiff, but with triple the number of people in its boundaries. She says it's shameful that, despite the evidence, the government is refusing to support calls for a ceasefire. She adds that it is doing "reputational damage to the UK's interest at home and abroad". "Where are the arms export bans to Israel, which give clear evidence of their use against civilians?" she asks. "Where is the diplomatic pressure on the Israeli government to comply with the ICJ ruling?" She adds: "Where is the provision of treatment for injured Palestinian children in the UK specialist hospitals?" She concludes her statement: "The longer we allow death and violence to continue, the rising reactions in the form of antisemitism and Islamophobia will continue to spread through all our communities.
