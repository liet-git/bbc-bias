Hamas's armed wing has released another video of an Israeli hostage. He is dual British-Israeli national Nadav Popplewell, who was kidnapped from Kibbutz Nirim on 7 October. In the 11-second clip, the 51-year-old identifies himself by name, before the video cuts to a question mark superimposed with text in Arabic and Hebrew: "Time is running out. Your government is lying. " Nadav Popplewell has an obvious bruise under one of his eyes. It is not clear when the video was taken. He was taken hostage with his mother Channa Peri. His brother Roy was killed in the 7 October attacks. Channa Peri was released in November. Nadavâ€™s sister Ayelet Svatitzky told the BBC in October that Nadav was diabetic. She said the medication issue was "really troubling and worrying". Svatitzky and her brothers are all British. The family originally came from Wakefield, West Yorkshire. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
