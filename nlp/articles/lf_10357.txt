The US government is "reviewing" Hamas's acceptance of a ceasefire deal, according to White House national security spokesman John Kirby. At the start of a news briefing at the White House, Kirby declined to give more details on the US assessment of ongoing ceasefire talks, adding that doing so could endanger the deal. "The last thing I want to do is say anything at that podium that will put that process at risk," he said, adding that the Biden administration would "not stop working" on a ceasefire. When asked by a reporter, Kirby also declined to comment on what aspects of the deal Hamas agreed to. He added that the Hamas statement came after, and "as a result of", ceasefire talks that CIA Director William Burns has had in the region in recent days. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
