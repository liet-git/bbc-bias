Two charities - Save the Children and Islamic Relief - say they will continue operating in Gaza, after an Israeli air strike killed seven aid workers in the territory. Save the Children says its staff will "continue working around the clock" despite a "horrendous trend" of attacks on aid workers. The charity says it "takes all possible measures to keep our staff safe", but "that is getting harder". Meanwhile, Islamic Relief says its staff remain "at constant risk alongside every other civilian in Gaza", with every aid delivery being "difficult and perilous". T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
