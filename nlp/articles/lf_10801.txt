Women and girls in Gaza who are having their periods are having to use nappies or scraps of cloth because they can't get hold of sanitary products, women have told the French news agency AFP. "I cut up any piece of cloth I find, and I use them like sanitary towels for my period," said Hala Ataya, who says she had to leave Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza and fled to the southern city of Rafah. "There's no security, no food, no water, no hygiene. I'm ashamed, I feel humiliated," said Samar Shalhoub, 18, who was displaced from Gaza City. Shalhoub has been using rags instead of hygienic pads and says she has suffered skin infections as a consequence. Another displaced woman in Rafah, Umm Saif, said her five daughters were "all using Pampers" for their periods. Action Against Hunger says that many women's clothes were stained with menstrual blood and they were "using period products for longer than anticipated, increasing the risk of infection". The fighting in Gaza has left hundreds of thousands of people displaced and facing severe shortages of basic necessities. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
