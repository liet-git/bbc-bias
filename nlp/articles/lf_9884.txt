The Red Cross has said there is "no safe area" in Gaza for evacuees, after the Israeli government called on aid agencies to "work with us" to evacuate civilians in Rafah ahead of their intended ground operation. "I cannot imagine that any international organisation would have the capacity, the logistical preparations and the security guarantee to evacuate hundreds of thousands of people,” Hisham Mhanna, spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), told the BBC's World at One on Radio 4. “There is no destination to evacuate this large number of people to," said Mhanna, who is currently in the city of Rafah. "There is nowhere in Gaza now that is equipped as a safe environment, [a] safe area - so I see nowhere for people to go further than Rafah. " He said many in the border city had been displaced, on average, five times since the conflict broke out in Gaza in October. Around 1.5 million Palestinians are now estimated to be sheltering in Rafah. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
