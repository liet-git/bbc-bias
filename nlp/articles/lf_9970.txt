We have just heard that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has invited, in an unusual move, the heads of all the opposition parties to a security briefing in Tel Aviv. This is going to heighten the speculation about what kind of discussion is being conducted inside that war cabinet which has been tasked with making the decision about what Israel should do next. Israeli media are talking about some heated debates and about a division with some of the former army chiefs including Benny Gantz and Gadi Eisenkot, arguing for a swift and forceful response which sends a very clear signal and firmly establishes Israeli deterrence. Others are arguing that this is a moment when Israel is enjoying strong backing from the international community and it should take time to solidify this coalition. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
