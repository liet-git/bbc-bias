The White House is also holding its daily media briefing, and National Security Council spokesman John Kirby is taking questions. Kirby tells reporters the US never said Israel should not go into Rafah to take out Hamas targets, but he says “Israel has an obligation” to protect civilians. Admiral Kirby follows the same talking point we just heard in the State Department briefing - that Israel must have a humanitarian plan for civilians in Rafah. "The proper number of civilian casualties is zero. We don't want to see a single innocent civilian death, Israeli or Palestinian," Kirby says. Kirby says Israel has heard "loud and clear" what the US expects. He also tells the briefing the US will continue to support Israel so it can defend itself. Multiple reporters are quizzing Kirby about what leverage the US might have if Israel does not have a plan in place for Rafah. But Kirby refuses to be drawn into what he calls "hypotheticals".
