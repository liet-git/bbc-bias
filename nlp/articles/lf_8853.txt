Israel's ambassador to the UN, Gilad Erdan, has firmly rejected calls for a ceasefire. He told the UN that "a ceasefire cements Hamas’s control of Gaza" and sends a mesage that "Hamas is forgiven for their deliberate atrocities". Erdan also said "Hamas’s oppression of Gazans" had been given a "green light by the international community". "Without the military pressure applied on Hamas no amount of diplomacy can secure the release of hostages," he added. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
