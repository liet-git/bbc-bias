Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey condemns Iran's attack as an "alarming escalation" in a conflict that has "already seen far too many deaths and suffering". He says his party supports the action taken by the RAF to intercept Iranian drones "as we stand up for Israel's security". But he says his party also worries about what Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government will do next. Davey says Sunak is right to say further escalation must be prevented, and asks the prime minister if he agrees the best way to achieve that is to press all sides to "agree to an immediate, bilateral ceasefire in Gaza", get the hostages home, get aid in, and "put us on the path to a lasting peace", and a two-state solution. Sunak says he has repeatedly called for an immediate humanitarian pause to act as the foundation for a sustainable ceasefire, but says it is worth pointing out that "Hamas have yet again rejected another offer to release hostages".
