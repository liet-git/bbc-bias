Matt Western , Labour MP for Warwick and Leamington, is up. He raises alleged comments made by members of Warwickshire Country Council about children with special educational needs. Western quotes them as saying that the children need "some form of strict correction" or they're "just really badly behaved kids". He says other "inappropriate language" was also used. Western asks Sunak if he condemns the councillors' language and urges them to resign. Sunak says he is not aware of the details of the allegations, adding that his government has a track record of supporting children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND).
