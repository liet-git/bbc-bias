We've just seen some of the images of the debris from one of the projectiles that Jordan intercepted overnight during Iran's attack on Israel, but there were several other countries involved in helping Israel defend itself. The US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin has said the US military had intercepted dozens of missiles and drones. UK fighter planes were also involved and an Israeli military spokesperson said France had contributed by patrolling air space. Meanwhile, Jordan has issued a statement saying it intercepted objects that entered its air space. As a reminder, President Biden will later host a meeting of G7 leaders to co-ordinate a diplomatic response to Iran's attack. RAF jets pictured back in February. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
