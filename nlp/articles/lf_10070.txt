Iran has reiterated a warning to Israel on Sunday, saying it should not respond to its unprecedented attack on Israeli territory and that its next steps would be bigger should this happen. The Iranian armed forces chief of staff, Major General Mohammad Bagheri, told state TV that if Israeli retaliates, Iran's response would be "much larger" than the overnight bombardment, Reuters reports. Iran also warned Washington that backing Israeli retaliation would lead to the targeting of US bases. Earlier, Iran's mission to the UN cited the UN Charter provision for self defence, under Article 51, and said that the country considered "this matter. . . concluded" after its barrage against Israel, while also warning Israeli against making "another mistake".
