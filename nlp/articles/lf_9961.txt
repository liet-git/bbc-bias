Sunak says Saturday's attack was that of a "despotic regime". "Tel Aviv was not the only target of drones on Saturday, Putin was also launching them at Kyiv and Kharkiv," he says, reminding Parliament of the war in Ukraine. Sunak says Russia has been speaking up for Iran to "justify their own actions". "The threats to stability are growing not just in the Middle East but everywhere and we're meeting those threats time after time, with British forces at the forefront. " "That's why our pilots were in action this weekend, they were policing in the skies above Iran and Syria for a decade, our sailors in the Red Sea against the reckless attacks of the Iran-backed Houthi militia.
