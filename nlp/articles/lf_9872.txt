It has been a tense day in Rafah, following an overnight raid by Israeli forces to rescue two hostages, with nearly 70 Palestinians killed in the border city, according to Hamas-run health ministry officials. As we wind up our live coverage, here's a summary of the key events: Senior UN officials, as well as key allies, have stepped up calls for Israel to refrain from attacking the overcrowded city of Rafah. UN human rights chief Volker TÃ¼rk said a fully-fledged military operation would be terrifying, given some 1.5m Gazans are sheltering in the area. The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Philippe Lazzarini, said civil order in the city was breaking down and aid lorries were being looted. Israel has urged humanitarian agencies to cooperate with its efforts to evacuate civilians from conflict zones. But UK Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron urged Israel to "stop and think seriously" before taking further action in the city, stressing there was "nowhere" for people to escape to. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell went further and called on allies of Israel to halt arms sales to the country. The Israeli government responded by accusing those Western leaders demanding it curtails activities in Rafah of "complicity with Hamas's human shields' strategy" Israel says Rafah is the last stronghold for Hamas fighters , and key to securing the release of the remaining hostages in Gaza. The two hostages rescued overnight on Sunday are in "good medical condition" and have been reuinted with their families. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
