Across the country at the University of Southern California (USC) in Los Angeles, 93 people were taken into custody for trespassing charges on Wednesday. Defiant pro-Palestinian protesters were dressed in kaffiyehs, and were equipped with megaphones and drums. They were met by helmeted officers in riot gear who moved to disperse the crowd, giving them 10-minute warnings to move. Helicopters hovered overhead. “Your time is up. Leave the area or you will be arrested for trespassing,” police said. The protest was reported to have been largely peaceful at first, but then turned tense. As police tried to detain one woman, protesters threw water bottles at them and chanted: "Let her go!" The arrests at USC were made as students gathered in Alumni Park - where the university's main-stage graduation ceremony is scheduled to take place next month. Professors were given the option to teach virtually on Thursday. Police make an arrest at the University of Southern California. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
