As the protests become increasingly political, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders , an independent who caucuses with Democrats, has hit back at Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu's description of the demonstrations as "horrific". Sanders replied on X: "No, Mr Netanyahu. It is not antisemitic or pro-Hamas to point out that in a little over six months your extremist government has killed 34,000 Palestinians and wounded more than 77,000 – 70% of whom are women and children. " While left-wing Democrats have accused college authorities of a heavy-handed response to the demonstrations, other lawmakers in the party have voiced concern about reports of antisemitism at the rallies. Republicans lawmakers have been more vocal in criticising the student activists. South Carolina congresswoman Nancy Mace posted on X: “Today in the US, we have entitled little Ivy League students terrorizing Jews on campus and their punishment? Student loans paid off by American taxpayers. Thanks Joe Biden. " Senator Tim Scott - another South Carolina Republican and a possible running mate for Donald Trump - wrote on X: "We cannot be a nation of hate. Standing in the gap for our Jewish brothers and sisters is the right thing to do and it is the American thing to do. " US Senator Bernie Sanders. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
