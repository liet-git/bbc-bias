T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Mark Lyall-Grant, the UK's former Permanent Representative to the UN, says today marks a "significant shift" in the US position on the war in Gaza. Lyall-Grant outlined that although it demands the unconditional release of hostages, the difference with this resolution is that their release is "not directly linked to the call for an immediate ceasefire". "Israel is now under an obligation, essentially, to stop its military campaign for the next 15 days until at least the end of Ramadan," he tells BBC Radio 4's PM programme. "Legally, this resolution is binding on the state of Israel. But it's actually not binding on Hamas, because Hamas is not a country and therefore it has a slightly different legal capacity. " He adds that there is no alternative for Israel "if they're going to stick with international law". Despite this, Lyall-Grant explains that the UN cannot impose sanctions against Israel if it ignores the resolution. The significance of this is that it draws a very clear distinction between the US and Israel and so if Israel does not abide by this resolution, then the question is, what does America do about that in terms of arms sales, political support for Israel, going forward.
