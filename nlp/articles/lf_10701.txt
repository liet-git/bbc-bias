T-I-T-L-E-E-N-D.  T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. I don’t think Israeli forces have been able to progress as far as they would like to. It is difficult to be accurate from this side of the border, as we are unable to report from inside Gaza, but when our team was driving to Tel Aviv yesterday, we witnessed real fear and terror on the motorway when a rocket strike came in from Gaza. The sirens were sounded, the Iron Dome anti-missile system was activated, people swerved to a halt, leapt out of their cars and ran for cover. Traffic accidents occurred as cars ran into each other in the chaos. On the Gaza side, Israeli forces are fighting heavily in Khan Younis and still fighting in the north near Gaza city. Israel has not yet controlled those areas. So while Israel claims to be killing many Hamas fighters, they are still popping out of their tunnels and targeting Israeli soldiers, and the names of the reservists who have been killed are being published. So how do we measure whether Hamas is beaten? Hamas still have a chain of command and Israel cannot claim that the key Hamas leaders have been captured or killed – none of the three names on their must-get list have been taken. And while Hamas can fire rockets into Israel - causing the kind of real panic I witnessed yesterday - well, I think they are still going and that’s something that, by this point, Israel was hoping would not be the case.
