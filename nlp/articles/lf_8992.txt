Footage emerged on 24 December showing a large number of detainees being rounded up at in a stadium in Gaza. Among those being held appear to be minors, based on their height and build. As with other such footage released in recent weeks, those being held are stripped to their underwear and holding their hands up, under the watch of armed soldiers. Women and young children are also seen within the stadium â€“ although they are fully clothed. A man in a wheelchair is also visible at one point. BBC Verify and BBC Arabic were able to confirm the location by analysing available imagery of various stadiums in the Gaza strip and matching it to the details seen in the footage. In this case, the presence of a racetrack, and the shape and positioning of several buildings seen in the background confirmed that the footage was filmed at the Yarmouk stadium in Gaza City. These images are freely available on Google where we can see the stadium being used for cycling events. The video also shows tanks and other vehicles carving up the turf of the pitch, which provided a clue as to when the footage was shot. Satellite imagery shows that track marks appeared between 14 and 18 December, which tallies with reports on Telegram saying soldiers were in the area of the stadium and calling for people to surrender around 15 December.
