Hello and welcome to our live coverage as we wait to hear from a panel of judges at the UN’s highest court over South Africa’s request to order a halt to Israel’s offensive in Rafah, in southern Gaza. Lawyers for South Africa have asked the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to impose emergency provisional measures, which they say are necessary to ensure the survival of the Palestinian people. They are also seeking to force Israel to allow aid workers, journalists and investigators “unimpeded access” to Gaza. It all forms part of a larger case brought to the Hague-based court by South Africa about Israel’s actions in Gaza. Israel, which has called South Africa’s case “wholly unfounded”, says its offensive in Rafah is necessary to destroy the last remaining Hamas battalions after the 7 October attack. One key thing to note is that while ICJ rulings are legally binding, in practice they are unenforceable by the court. We’ll be bringing you the latest lines from the court, analysis and reaction to the ruling once it comes.
