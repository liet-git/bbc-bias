Mediations for ceasefire negotiations are very much Egyptian-led. The Qataris are also involved - the Middle Eastern country is home to the political leadership of Hamas. Egypt borders Gaza and they have a vested interest in seeing calm restored. They don’t want the violence to spill over their borders, so it’s the Egyptians and Egyptian intelligence pushing this through. Hamas has been quite canny militarily - they hold 128 hostages, of whom at least 34 are presumed dead, meaning they're in quite a good bargaining position. Every night I drive past protesters here in Jerusalem, waving banners featuring calls to “Bring them home” or similar. Tens of thousands were protesting in Tel Aviv just a couple of nights ago - they don’t believe the Israeli government is doing enough. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
