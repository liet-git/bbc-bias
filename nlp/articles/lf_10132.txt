BBC Arabic has been speaking to patients suffering from chronic medical conditions in Gaza. Tens of thousands of people there have long-term health conditions in Gaza, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). But the WHO says it had to cancel more medical supplies being brought into the area, after failing to receive security guarantees. Om Khalil is an asthma patient and her case became worse from the ongoing displacement, alongside the scarcity of medications. “I can’t do my breathing sessions because they require electricity and there is no electricity. " Khalil also says she can't access her medication and that if patients don't die from the ongoing bombardment they "will die from the shortage in medications". Om Ali suffers from high blood pressure and diabetes. She says it has been months since she took what she needs. She says: "Since the displacement. . . I can’t find the medications nor am I able to get up, I’m very ill. " Dr Ahmed Hesham Sakr works in one of the pharmacies in Rafah where he says there is an "extreme shortage" in medical resources due to the closed boarders and ongoing war. He wants the WHO to allow "the weakest long-term illness patients to leave the district of Gaza so they can receive the medical care they need". Medical supplies have been airdropped by the French and Jordanian air forces for a field hospital set up in Khan Younis. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
