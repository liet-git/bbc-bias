We're expecting to hear from UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak this afternoon, who will be delivering a statement on Iran's attack on Israel. In the meantime, we've just got some comments from Sunak's spokesperson, who says the PM  rejects Iran's assertion that it gave advanced warning of the attack on Israel. Yesterday Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said  that Iran gave neighbouring countries, and Israel's ally the United States, 72 hours' notice that it would launch the strikes. "I would reject that characterisation," Sunak's spokesman tells reporters. "And more broadly we condemn in the strongest possible terms their direct attack against Israel. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
