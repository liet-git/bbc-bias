The deadliest day for the Jews since the Holocaust unfolded on the morning of 7 October. Waves of Hamas gunmen stormed across Gaza's border into Israel, killing about 1,200 people. Hamas also launched more than 5,000 rockets across southern Israel. Those killed included children, the elderly and 364 young people at a music festival. Hamas took 253 others to Gaza as hostages. Of those taken, about 130 remain unaccounted for, at least 34 of whom are presumed dead. The surprise attacks on Israel took place on the Jewish Sabbath which coincided with the religious festival of Simchat Torah. The Israel Defense Forces took hours to contain the attackers and did not give the all-clear until days afterwards. It is considered a catastrophic failing of the security and intelligence services, which Israel has pledged to thoroughly investigate. In the next few posts we’ll look at some of the communities that were devastated on this day six months ago. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
