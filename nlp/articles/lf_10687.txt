T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. The humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip remains desperate, aid groups are warning, as a tiny amount of the assistance needed in the territory is getting in. In recent days, about 20% of the aid required has entered the territory, much of which cannot be distributed because of the scale of Israeli bombardments, Melanie Ward, from Medical Aid for Palestinians, told the BBC. She described the aid getting in as a “drop in the ocean”, and said it is the “worst humanitarian catastrophe that any of us who work in Gaza have ever known”. The only border crossing currently open is at Rafah, on the Egyptian border, and the UN’s humanitarian agency, OCHA, said “limited aid distributions” are taking place there. Almost no aid has been able to get to the north of Gaza, due to the intensity of the fighting as well as restrictions of movement on the main road. Aid agencies say distributions increased into Gaza during the week-long ceasefire that ended on 1 December, which also saw the release of some hostages, but the situation has only grown worse since then. A limited number of trucks carrying humanitarian aid have managed to enter Gaza, mainly through the Rafah border crossing. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
