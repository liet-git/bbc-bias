At the US State Department briefing, press secretary Matt Miller says the US doesn’t believe that the International Criminal Court has jurisdiction over either Israel or Hamas. He says that Hamas should be “held accountable” for its actions, however. Miller’s condemnations are focused on the warrants targeting Israeli officials. He says they would “embolden” Hamas and make it less likely that negotiations to implement a ceasefire and gain the release of hostages will be successful. For the moment, the US is not putting any concrete consequences behind its harsh words. When asked what the US will do next, Miller says he had no announcements to make. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
