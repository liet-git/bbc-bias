Israel's ambassador to the United Nations Gilad Erdan has reacted angrily to UN Secretary General Antonio Guterresâ€™s appeal for a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza, and reiterated calls for him to resign. "Today, the secretary-general has reached a new moral low," he said. He added that the call for a ceasefire was "actually a call to keep Hamas' reign of terror in Gaza". "The distorted positions of the secretary general only prolong the fighting in Gaza, because they give hope to the Hamas terrorists that the war will be stopped and they will be able to survive," he said. I again call on the secretary-general to resign immediately - the UN needs a secretary-general who supports the war on terror, not a secretary-general who acts according to the script written by Hamas.
