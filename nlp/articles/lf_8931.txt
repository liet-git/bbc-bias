T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Let's bring you some thoughts from Sir Peter Westmacott, a former British Ambassador to Turkey, France and the US, who feels it is a step forward to at least have a resolution going before the UN later today. "It is definitely better to have a resolution which can go through the security council without a US veto than not to have one at all," Sir Peter tells the BBC. "I think it could be of real value of alleviating the immediate suffering in Gaza. "I'm not sure it takes us much further in stopping the hostilities. " Sir Peter feels the US government "has done its best" to put pressure on Benjamin Netanyahu's government. He adds that "pulling the plug on support for Israel would be politically impossible".
