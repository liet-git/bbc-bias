T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. The Israeli goverment has accused Western leaders urging Israel not to proceed with military operations in Rafah of being "complicit with Hamas's  human shields' strategy". "In telling Israel not to attack because civilians will be hurt, but then resisting efforts to get civilians out of harm's way, they have rendered themselves complicit with Hamasâ€™ human shields strategy," said Israeli government spokesman Eylon Levy. "The United Nations and international actors now face a fateful choice. Do they want to save Hamas or save Palestinian civilians?" added Levy. "They cannot stop Israel from dismantling the last four Hamas battalions in the Gaza Strip and securing the release of 134 remaining hostages. " Overnight on Sunday, two hostages were freed by members of the Israeli army after being found captive in the centre of Rafah. Earlier today, Levy called on UN relief agencies to cooperate with the Israeli government's efforts to evacuate civilians in Rafah, to avoid them getting caught up in the offensive. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
