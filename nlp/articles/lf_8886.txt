T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. I've been speaking Dr Nasser, a senior clinician sheltering at the European hospital in Khan Younis, the city in southern Gaza which has seen intense fighting over the last few days, "I will be honest with you, I am very hungry and I have low energy," he says. I have been hungry for a while now. We only received food aid once, and it was mostly biscuits and canned food" Dr Nasser. Nasser says if he does manage to secure any food, he makes sure his children eat. "I have not experienced the feeling of being full for weeks," he continues. He tells me his children are afraid of the dark and the sound of bombing terrifies them. My son is five years old and he asks me to get him rice and meat. He doesn't understand that his father is more hungry than he is. " Dr Nasser. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
