The humanitarian situation in the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza is extremely dire. For the last five days, tanks have surrounded the area from all directions. Thousands of people still remain inside the camp. I received text messages this morning from a resident who was displaced and who moved to Jabalia. He said they had been without food and without water for the last five days. Dozens of similar messages reached some local radio stations that operate in the southern Gaza Strip about the continuation of the Israeli raids on the Jabalia camp. Islam Badr, an activist in the Jabalia camp, sent a voice message, saying: “It’s 08:00 on Saturday morning. The Israeli artillery continues its bombardment of the Jabalia camp. ”. We understand none of the aid allowed into Gaza has reached northern Gaza and Gaza City since the ceasefire. Israeli troops operating in the Jabalia camp on Friday. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
