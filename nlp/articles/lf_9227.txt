We aren't able to give you lot of detail about what's happening in Gaza's southern city of Khan Younis, one of the main focuses of the current fighting. Israel said on Wednesday its forces were encircling the area. On Thursday it said it had "killed Hamas terrorists and struck dozens of terror targets" in the city. We are receiving images from the city via news agencies. Many of them are too distressing and graphic to show here, including scenes of injured people being carried into hospital, and others of people lying on crowded floors awaiting treatment - with woman and small children among them. Here are a few photographs of events in the city today. You may find some of them distressing. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
