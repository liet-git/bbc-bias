Ahmed Yousef, a former senior political adviser to Ismail Haniyeh, the political head of Hamas - widely considered to be the group's overall leader - who is now based in Qatar, spoke to BBC Radio 4's World at One programme a little earlier. He says Hamas, a proscribed terrorist group in the UK, US and other countries, is serious about a ceasefire and blames Israel and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the deadlock in negotiations - saying Hamas leaders have spoken about making "a lot of positive concessions". "Netanyahu is the one responsible for all these things that have happened and until now I think Hamas have said to the Egyptians, to the Qataris, even to the Americans, that they are ready, they are flexible to have a positive reaction to the proposal submitted by these three countries," he says. "But until now the Israelis, they keep saying no, no, no, no, and asking for more concessions that make Hamas in a very embarrassing position. " Ceasefire talks in Cairo have stalled following a Hamas rocket strike on the Kerem Shalom border crossing. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has described Israel's offer to Hamas as "extraordinarily generous", but Yousef rejects that characterisation. Israel and Hamas have blamed each other for the deadlock in ceasefire talks. On Sunday, Netanyahu reiterated Israel's aim to disarm and dismantle Hamas for good or else endanger Israel's future security. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
