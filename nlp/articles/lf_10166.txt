IDF spokesman Jonathan Conricus has told the BBC that the killing of three Israeli hostages is being investigated. When asked about the misidentification, he gave two possible reasons. “One, they were dressed in civilian clothing probably in a similar fashion to what we have seen on Hamas combatants,” he said. He didn’t clarify if the hostages were holding weapons. “The second one is that before and after this tragic mistake occurred there were clashes in the area between Israeli troops and Hamas combatants,” he said.
