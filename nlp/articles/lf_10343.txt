The Palestinian Islamic Jihad's armed wing said its militants had launched rockets from Gaza towards southern Israel Monday in response to Israeli air strikes on the Palestinian territory. "We have targeted Sderot, Nir Am, and settlements in the Gaza envelope with rocket barrages," it said in a statement, translated by the AFP new agency. The "Gaza envelope" refers to a zone of southern Israel close to Gaza. The PIJ is Gaza's second largest armed faction and - like Hamas - a proscribed terrorist organisation in the UK and other countries. As we've been reporting, sirens sounded in southern Israeli a short while ago with pictures showing the Iron Dome defence system intercepting missiles heading for Israel. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
