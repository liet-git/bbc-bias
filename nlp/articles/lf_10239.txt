Up until now, Israeli authorities say around 7,000 Hamas fighters have been killed, from an estimated 20,000 the group had before the war. In some areas in Gaza, Hamas and its allies are fighting back. And top Hamas leaders have not been captured or killed yet, including the head of the group in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar. Israel believes they are hiding in Khan Younis, which has been the focus of the Israeli military in the south. Even if the Hamas infrastructure is destroyed, its ideology is likely to resist. There are some signs, for example, that Hamasâ€™s popularity is rising in the occupied West Bank. Amid so much loss of life and suffering, Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani gave a warning last weekend: the war risked radicalising an entire generation across the Middle East.
