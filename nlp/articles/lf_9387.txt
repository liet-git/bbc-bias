We’ve just had a message from Mosa Al-Dos, a 26-year-old lawyer in Rafah: “I woke up more than one time in the night because it was so cold in the tent,” he says. “I struggle to sleep because of the lack of mattresses and blankets. There are a lot of queues today - they are reaching at least three hours. “Now I am two kilometres away from my tent, trying to find internet connection but it is still very weak. I am slowly, slowly walking further from the tent," he adds. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
