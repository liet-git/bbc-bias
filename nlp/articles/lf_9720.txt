Our colleagues at BBC Arabic's Gaza Lifeline programme have been speaking to Gazans at the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza about the World Central Kitchen (WCK) temporarily suspending its work inside the Strip. One woman says it is a "real tragedy". "This organisation used to provide a lot of assistance to the people and we often saw its products in the markets where people traded and ate them," she says. " As for the incident, it is a tragedy for the families of the victims and even the Palestinian people who have been negatively affected by it, as the aid we used to receive has decreased. " Targeting aid workers affects residents "a lot", one person says, adding: "It scares everyone who tries to help us because they know that they can be targeted at any moment". Another woman says the food the workers from WCK provided was "healthy", with meals being "distributed safety at the school where we have been displaced". T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
