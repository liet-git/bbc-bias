At least three aid convoys in Gaza for the UN's relief agency (Unrwa) have been hit by the Israeli military in recent months, according to the organisation's communications director. Speaking to the BBC's Newsday, Juliette Touma says the organisation co-ordinates their movements with the Israeli army - "where we are, what are the names and nationalities of people. . . the route, the GPS co-ordinates" - but still "have been hit, luckily without casualties". Touma says "people are terrified," and wherever they are, aid workers "should be protected". T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
