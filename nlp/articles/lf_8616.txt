Three people from Syria and Lebanon have been arrested in Argentina, suspected of planning what the government said was a "terrorist act" as the country hosts a major Jewish sporting event. The Pan American Maccabi Games that brings together around 4,000 athletes from Israeli and Jewish backgrounds is currently taking place in Buenos Aires. Security Minister Patricia Bullrich said the authorities had been on high alert and had received intelligence from the United States and Israel on the potential threat from a "terrorist cell". The three suspects had booked a hotel near the Israeli embassy and were awaiting the arrival of 35kg parcel from Yemen, Bullrich said. Argentina has the largest Jewish community in Latin America, the target of two major attacks in 1992 and 1994, which killed more than 100 people. Read more here.
