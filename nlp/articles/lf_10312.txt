In diplomatic terms, the most interesting question now is what the Americans say and do. Because overnight their briefers have been very, very cautious, refusing to say anything substantive about the Hamas announcement, simply saying that a deal is achievable and that they oppose, and they continue to oppose, any military operation in Rafah. But on the substance they have remained remarkably quiet. And that is because if the Americans at any stage publicly say ‘this is what Israel must accept’, then at that point the pressure on the Israeli government is huge. But we’re not at that point yet, because the Americans have yet to say what is their substantive view on what Hamas has agreed to. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
