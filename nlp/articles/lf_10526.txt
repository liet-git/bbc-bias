T-I-T-L-E-E-N-D.  T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. We've heard from Justin Crump, who is the chief executive of Sibylline, a defence and intelligence company. In an interview with the BBC Radio 4's World at One, Crump says US President Joe Biden's warning in essence tells Israel "'we won't give these more destructive systems that the Israelis might use as a sledgehammer'". But Crump adds that Washington will "carry on supplying and supporting Israel" against outside aggression. Earlier, Biden warned Israel against a major ground offensive in Rafah. Asked about the impact this might have on Israel's military strategy, Crump says it "reduces the options". "I think it sends a strong political message", he adds. "It certainly causes Israel to think more carefully," he adds. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
