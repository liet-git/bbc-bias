Legislation to provide billions of dollars in new security assistance for Israel and Ukraine has been blocked by Republican members of the US Senate. They're insisting on more funding for tougher immigration control at the US border with Mexico before any other foreign assistance is given. This marks a significant defeat for President Joe Biden, who'd made an impassioned appeal to Republican congressmen to approve the additional package. Sixty votes were needed to start debate on the multi-billion dollar aid bill. The voting went along party lines, with every Senate Republican voting no. Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who generally votes with Democrats, also voted No. He has expressed concerns about funding Israel's "current inhumane military strategy" against the Palestinians.
