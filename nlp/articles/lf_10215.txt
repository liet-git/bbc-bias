T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Israel has continued its heavy bombardment of Gaza overnight, with children reported to have been among those killed in strikes on Khan Younis and Rafah in the south. Recently, the US - Israel’s closest ally - has shown increasing disquiet about the number of civilian casualties and the humanitarian crisis caused by the war. White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said his talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about shifting to a more precise phase of military operations had been “constructive”. Unconfirmed reports suggest the US is pressing for that by the end of the year. In Washington, US President Biden said he didn’t want Israel to stop going after Hamas but wanted it “to be focused on how to save civilian lives. ” Today, Sullivan is due to meet Palestinian Authority officials in the occupied West Bank. In a separate development, Israeli special forces are said to have recovered the body of an Israeli hostage, Elia Toledano, who was snatched by Hamas from a music festival on 7 October. More than 100 hostages are still thought to be alive in Gaza. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
