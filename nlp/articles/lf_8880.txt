As we've been reporting, Israel says that it will open the Kerem Shalom border crossing in the next few days to allow aid into Gaza. It has been closed since the 7 October Hamas attacks. The Kerem Shalom crossing is located southeast of Rafah, and is solely a commercial goods junction between Israel and southern Gaza. It was first closed by Israel along with the Erez crossing in north Gaza soon after Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October. Israel has now agreed to open it to screen goods being taken into Gaza from Egypt. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
