International medical aid groups say that increasing Israeli military activity means they have been forced to stop working at Gaza's al-Aqsa Hospital. In a statement, the Medical Aid for Palestinians and International Rescue Committee's emergency medical team (EMT) says Israel's military has dropped leaflets designating the areas surrounding the hospital as a "red zone", adding that given Israel's history of attacks on medical staff and facilities in Gaza, "the team is unable to return". Professor Nick Maynard, a surgeon and clinical lead EMT, says the number of wounded being brought to the hospital over the last few days has been "horrific". Dr James Smith, emergency medical specialist with the EMT, says he is fearful "for the immediate safety of people in the area, the Palestinian staff we’ve worked alongside, the hundreds of patients in the hospital, and thousands of displaced people in the hospital compound and nearby camps. ”. A local emergency physician in the area adds: “I’m really scared because the past few days they’re getting closer and closer, and no place is safe anymore. Where should people go if they get injured?" The Medical Aid for Palestinians charity and the International Rescue Committee say they remain committed to sustaining  providing emergency medical services in Gaza "wherever it is safe to do so".
