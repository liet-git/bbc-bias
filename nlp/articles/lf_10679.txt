US President Joe Biden has said Israel is starting to lose support around the world. His remarks are based on pool notes of a campaign event, and he was referring to the international community’s dismay and alarm at the bombing of Gaza. However, Biden gave no indication Israel was losing US support for its military campaign, despite his administration’s growing concern about the enormous cost in Palestinian lives and destruction of civilian infrastructure. He did express differences with Israel over plans for Gaza’s future. He said the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was opposed to a two-state solution with the Palestinians, something that Biden’s top officials have been promoting as the post-war path. And he urged Netanyahu to “strengthen and change…the most conservative government in Israel's history," in order to find a long-term solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Netanyahu acknowledged the disagreement yesterday, but said Israel has US support for its goal of destroying Hamas and recovering hostages held by the group. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
