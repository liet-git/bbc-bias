If you're just joining us, here's a round-up of the key developments from the Israel-Gaza war today: UN aid has entered Gaza directly from Israel for the first time since fighting broke out. Deliveries via the Kerem Shalom crossing which borders the Strip will help increase the volume of aid reaching civilians in Gaza. The opening of the crossing comes as the level of hunger and desperation increases, with footage showing crowds in Rafah boarding aid trucks and racing to grab supplies. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu continues to reject calls for a ceasefire as pressure mounts from the UK, Germany and France who have all called for the fighting in Gaza to stop. Gaza's largest hospital has been described as a "bloodbath" by the WHO. Palestinian news agency Wafa says that dozens of people have been killed in strikes on the Jabalia refugee camp in Gaza . The Israeli military said it had come under fire from Hamas operatives in the area. A funeral for one of the hostages mistakenly killed by the IDF on Friday has taken place in central Israel. Alon Shamriz was mis-identified as a "threat" by an Israeli soldier, along with hostages Yotam Haim and Samer Talalka who were also killed. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
