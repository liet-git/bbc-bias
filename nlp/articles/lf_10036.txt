Iran's state TV repeatedly aired a video of a fire in Chile today, claiming that it was footage of missiles successfully hitting targets in Israel. The clip, run several times during the live coverage of Iran's retaliatory attack, shows a motorway in the foreground while a huge fire turns the night sky red. A woman can be heard speaking in Spanish while another subs. The video was one of several clips to show Iranian missiles and drones successfully pass through Israel's air defence "minutes ago" and strike pre-designated targets, state TV reported. But the footage is neither recent nor related to Iran's retaliatory attack against Israel. The BBC has found the original version of the clip posted to TikTok in February , showing a fire in  Vina del Mar, Chile. Several other Iranian news outlets also published the clip with the same false claim. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
