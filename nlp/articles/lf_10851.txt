Several regional and international leaders have spoken today at the Doha Forum in Qatar - where the situation in Gaza was the key topic of discussion. Here's some of what was said: Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani said Israel's bombardment of Gaza was "narrowing the window" to secure a new ceasefire. Qatar helped to broker a previous week-long pause in hostilities. Palestinian PM Mohammad Shtayyeh (who does not govern in Gaza, but instead parts of the West Bank not under Israeli control) called for countries to sanction Israel. UN chief Ant√≥nio Guterres says he regretted the UN Security Council's failure to demand a ceasefire in a vote on Friday, adding that the organisation's "authority and credibility were severely undermined". The US opposed the move on behalf of its ally Israel; both argued that it would have benefited Hamas. Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, said the " dehumanisation of Palestinians has allowed the international community to bear continued Israeli attacks in Gaza" Dozens of world leaders are at the Doha Forum in Qatar's capital.
