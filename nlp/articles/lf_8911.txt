For the families in Gaza in desperate need of aid - those carefully formulated words of the UN’s resolution now have to translate into reality on the ground. That is the fix that the UN finds itself in with this watered down resolution. The UN resolution may have finally passed but Hamas and Israel have not agreed to any of it. In fact Hamas has doubled down on its position saying that there will be no deal to free the hostages until there’s a full ceasefire - a notion that is out of the question for Israel. Hamas has also continued to fire rockets with sirens sounding in Tel Aviv. Israel seems to be expanding its ground offensive in central Gaza after it issued an evacuation order to residents of Al-Bureij telling them to move further south. Nearly 400 people died in Gaza in last 48 hours - according the Hamas-run health ministry. The bombardment continues in Gaza’s north and south and has now reached Rafah. The director of the Kerem Shalom crossing was killed in a strike in the area on Thursday and the current picture makes any plans for the Kerem Shalom crossing to open and operate at full capacity that much riskier, especially given the vague language of the resolution with no outright mention of a pause or a truce. Humanitarian agencies are now asking for “any available route” for aid - not only does it speak of desperation to get aid in safely, but also that as it stands no particular route is safe. The need is not just for more aid to enter but for it to be distributed consistently and in an orderly way. This whole week has been about the language of diplomacy and how, as it stands, it stills falls short from what is needed on the ground. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
