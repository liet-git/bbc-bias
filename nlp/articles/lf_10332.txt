It's been difficult to get information from inside Rafah on Israel's operation there. The Israeli military said it had conducted "targeted strikes" in eastern Rafah. It earlier ordered the evacuation of some 100.000 people to a new humanitarian camp near Khan Younis. The Associated Press news agency said Israeli tanks had been spotted heading towards Rafah, on a route very close to the border with Egypt - but the BBC cannot independently verify this. Images of flares lighting the sky over the Gazan city earlier on Monday, which were sent to the BBC by a Palestinian medic, may suggest ground forces were involved in the raid - as flares are often used for illumination and target marking.
