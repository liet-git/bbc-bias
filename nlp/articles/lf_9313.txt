Israel appears to be intensifying it ground operations in many areas across the Gaza Strip, particularly around Khan Younis, but also in other areas. Here are some of the latest developments: Israel's military is continuing its advance towards southern Gaza’s Khan Younis , where it believes some of Hamas’s leadership could be hiding. Fighting is also ongoing in other areas including the Jabalia refugee camp and Shejaiya in northern Gaza. The head of UNRWA, the UN’s agency for Palestinian refugees, says more than 600,000 people are under evacuation orders in southern Gaza, nearly half of which have already been forced to leave their homes. Philippe Lazzarini also warned that “there is nowhere to go” as shelters are over capacity. Israel has urged civilians to move to Rafah near the Egyptian border, or to al-Mawasi, a thin strip of land along the Mediterranean coast . In an apparent reference to al-Mawasi, Unicef spokesman James Elder told the BBC that the "humanitarian areas" designated by Israel are “tiny patches of land” with no water or shelter. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says 73 people have been killed in central Gaza in the past 24 hours, while more than 100 injured people were taken to the al-Aqsa hospital. Israel’s army spokesman Daniel Hagari confirmed there are still 138 hostages being held in Gaza , and called on the international community to do more to secure their release. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
