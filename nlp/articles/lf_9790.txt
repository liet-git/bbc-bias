The assault on al-Shifa hospital today underlines the challenges facing Israel’s prime minister in achieving his war goals. Israel’s army carried out an extensive operation at the same hospital in November, trawling the complex, room by room, for Hamas fighters and evidence of what it said was a key ‘command and control centre’ for the group. In January, the army said it had dismantled Hamas’s entire command structure in the northern Gaza Strip, reducing its fighters to sporadic attacks “without commanders”. Now Israeli forces are back inside al-Shifa hospital, to arrest Hamas operatives they say had returned there. This military operation inside a protected medical facility adds pressure on negotiators in Qatar today, where both sides are due to resume talks on a ceasefire deal. One of the key sticking points is thought to be the demand from Hamas that civilians displaced by the war can return to their homes in the north. Israel is reportedly concerned that it could provide cover for Hamas to rebuild its capabilities there. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
