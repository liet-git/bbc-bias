World Health Organization (WHO) chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus says "the impact of the conflict on health is catastrophic", adding that "Gaza's health system is on its knees and collapsing. " Speaking at an event in Geneva, the WHO head says that Israeli actions to force Palestinians into a smaller and smaller area is creating the "ideal conditions for disease to spread. " He says there is just one shower for every 750 people and one toilet for every 150. And "only 14 hospitals out of the original 36 (in the Gaza Strip) are even partially functional”: two in the north and 12 in the south. The conditions for health workers - which were already very difficult in 2018 - are "impossible and they’re directly in the firing line”, Ghebreyesus says. And he says the WHO has recorded 449 attacks on healthcare in Gaza and the West Bank since the start of this conflict on 7 October - and 60 in Israel. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
