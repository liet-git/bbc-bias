T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. We're now hearing from the panel before this week's programme wraps up. Writer and former Vanity Fair editor Tina Brown, who often shares her expertise on the Royal Family, is speaking about Prince Harry. "After all the trashing of Harry, when I saw him and Meghan in Nigeria this week, I had a nostalgia. This is what could have been, these two, who are enormously appealing to the public, looking very attractive," she says. She thinks that the couple's distance from the Royal Family might be permanent. "But I think we needed Harry and Meghan and unfortunately what's come to pass with the cancer diagnosis shows how depleted the family is and I hope it does mend," she concludes. We'll be bringing you some more lines from the show and reflect on what we heard this morning, so stay with us. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex visited Nigeria this week. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
