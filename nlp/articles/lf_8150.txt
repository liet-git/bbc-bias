Stephen Flynn, the SNP's Westminster leader, is demanding the Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle return to the House of Commons to explain what has happened. He says if the Labour Party's amendment is carried, then the SNP vote will not be held - a consequence he says Hoyle was warned would happen. "Where on earth is the Speaker of the House of Commons and how do we bring him to this house now to explain to the SNP why our views and our votes in this house are irrelevant to him?" T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
