He says he told the war cabinet that the US stands with Israel in ensuring security of its northern border and he is committed to working with Israel to find a diplomatic solution to ensure security in Israel and Lebanon. Lasting peace requires a pathway to a Palestinian state, he says, and this needs a regional approach -these goals are attainable but only if they are pursued together. "Israel must be a partner to Palestinian leaders who are willing to lead their people in living side by side in peace with Israel as neighbours," he says. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
