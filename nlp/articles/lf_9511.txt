The co-ordination complaints have been pointed out by the Biden administration - publicly in gentle tones - to Israel since at least January, along with appeals for Israel to get more food to starving people. Yesterday’s strike, and the impact it will have on further aid supplies, deepens the crisis, with Gaza on the brink of famine. The White House has just said it is “outraged” by the strikes. But pressed about whether it would lead to conditioning US arms supplies to Israel, the administration’s reaction hasn’t veered from previous similar messages - which has been to describe this as a tragic incident, point to "deconfliction" problems and the need for more aid access, while calling on Israel to investigate.
