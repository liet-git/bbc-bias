T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. People are gathering outside the Tel Aviv Museum of Art in what is now known as Hostages Square, following the deaths of three captives who were shot dead by mistake by the Israeli military. The square has become a symbol of the agonising wait for the families. More than 100 people remain in captivity in Gaza. Posters with the faces of the hostages, kidnapped 70 days ago, have been glued to lampposts and walls, together with the message: “Bring them home now. ”. Since the end of a temporary ceasefire that allowed the release of around 100 captives, the families have urged the government to reach a new deal with Hamas for at least some of the remaining hostages to be freed. The Israeli authorities, however, say that military pressure is the only way to bring them home. The incident - described as “tragic” by the Israeli military - will add pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as the war in Gaza continues. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
