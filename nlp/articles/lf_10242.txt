An official from the UN World Food Programme (WFP) has described fear and desperation in Gaza as Palestinians wonder "where their next meal will come from". Addressing reporters, Carl Skau reiterated the WFP's line - first published at the weekend - that half of Gaza's population was starving and nine out of 10 people were not eating every day. He said the agency had managed to survey Palestinians during the recent week-long pause in fighting. Skau said he couldn't answer a question on whether starvation-related deaths had occurred in the territory. He said the WFP had observed "increasing desperation. . . and anger" at its distribution sites, due to a "breakdown of law and order" which he described as a growing problem. And he stressed that the agency's own staff were "living this crisis" themselves, while also trying to solve it. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
