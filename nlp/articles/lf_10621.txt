As we reach early evening here in London, here's a quick recap of what's happened so far today: Israel's foreign minister says Israel will continue the war "with or without international support" , after last night's non-binding UN vote demanding a ceasefire in Gaza. The Hamas-run health ministry says 18,608 people have been killed in Gaza since the start of the war. Meanwhile, Israel says 10 IDF soldiers have been killed in northern Gaza - making it the deadliest day for the military since its ground offensive began. In the US, President Joe Biden has met family members of the American hostages in-person for the first time. And people have formed a human chain outside the Israeli parliament , demanding the release of all remaining hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. US and UK officials have announced a fresh wave of sanctions targeting individuals linked to Hamas. While the EU Commission President has called for sanctions on "extremist" Israeli settlers, who she says are responsible for attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank. And there have been warnings the UN Palestinian refugee agency's ability to help is on the "verge of collapse" T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
