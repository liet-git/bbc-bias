Sara El Shaer, another 10 year-old girl from Gaza, tells BBC Arabic's Gaza Lifeline programme that despite the collapse of their house and the loss of their things "due to the fierce bombing of war, we will celebrate and rejoice in Eid". But not all the children are celebrating, some are reluctant this year. Like Thuria El-Masry. "I am seven years old, during Eid I want to celebrate it, but because of the violent bombing, I do not know how to be happy. "I want to be happy on Eid night as I used to be before, and to take the Eid gifts and play with other children", Thuria says. Sara El Shaer is 10 years old and lives in Gaza.
