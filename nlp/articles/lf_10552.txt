As Israel's strikes on Rafah continue, around 80,000 people have fled the city since Monday, according to the UN agency for Palestinian refugees. "People are facing yet another forced displacement in the Gaza Strip," says Unrwa on X. "The toll on these families is unbearable. Nowhere is safe. We need a ceasefire now. " Previously, more than a million displaced Palestinians - half of them children - had been sheltering there. On Monday, the military told the tens of thousands of people in the eastern parts of Rafah to begin heading towards an â€œexpanded humanitarian area" , where it said they would find field hospitals, tents and basic supplies.
