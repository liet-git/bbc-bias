We have more voices now from some of the 600,000 children currently sheltering in Rafah. The Israeli military previously told people from other parts of Gaza to evacuate to Rafah, declaring it a safe zone, but is now planning to enter the city, saying an offensive there is necessary to eliminate Hamas. Ten-year-old Sara Amer, originally from Gaza City, told BBC Arabic she and the other children live each day “scared from every missile”. “This war is the toughest war we have witnessed. We want the war to completely stop,” she said. She shared her fears of the anticipated military offensive in the city she currently calls home. “If they [Israeli forces] enter, we will go through tough days and won’t be able to go anywhere because all of the places are bombarded. "There is not even a single area to set a tent. ”. Ten-year-old Sara, originally from Gaza City, is currently sheltering in Rafah. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
