It's just gone 03:00 in Israel and Gaza and 01:00 here in London on 7 December, two months since Hamas launched its devastating surprise attack on Israel, igniting a war which has left much of the Gaza Strip in ruins. Here's a recap of the main developments after a day of intense fighting in Gaza, and a new diplomatic war of words, as Israeli troops continue their hunt for Hamas operatives: UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres warned Security Council member states that the humanitarian system in Gaza could collapse, urging them to avert a "catastrophe" Israel's Foreign Minister, Eli Cohen, shaply criticised Guterres, saying his tenure was a "danger to world peace" In the south Gazan city of Khan Younis, which Israeli tanks and troops have now entered, hospitals have been overwhelmed since the Israeli air force intensified its bombardment on Friday, BBC Arabic's Adnan El-Bursh reports from the city. In northern Gaza, witnesses spoke about Israeli tanks surrounding the Jabalia refugee camp. Israel said it had agreed to allow a "minimal" supplement of fuel into Gaza "to prevent a humanitarian collapse and the outbreak of epidemics" in southern Gaza. Republican members of the US Senate blocked billions of dollars in new security assistance for Israel and Ukraine. Wednesday also brought a rare bit of good news for some of the most vulnerable people caught up in this conflict - premature newborn babies. A Reuters photographer visited the New Administrative Capital Hospital in the Egyptian capital Cairo where this tiny Palestinian evacuated from Gaza was receiving treatment. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
