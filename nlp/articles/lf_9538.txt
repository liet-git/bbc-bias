T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. The war in Gaza has led to at least 196 aid workers being killed before last night's attack on the seven WCK workers, according to data from the Aid Worker Security Database . Of those killed, 174 have worked for the UN, while aid organisation Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders) say at least five of their staff, alongside many of their family members, have been killed. Jamie McGoldrick, the humanitarian co-ordinator for the Occupied Palestinian Territory, says the recent fatal strike on Gaza is "not an isolated incident". Describing the Palestinian enclave as "one of the world’s most dangerous and difficult places to work," he says "there is no safe place left in Gaza". Israel has accused UNRWA of supporting Hamas, which the agency has denied, but in January it sacked nine of the 12 employees accused in an Israeli document of playing a part in the 7 October attacks. The UN has yet to publish the results of an investigation into Israel's claims. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
