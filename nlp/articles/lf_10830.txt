The Israeli defence ministry body overseeing policy for the Palestinian territories, Cogat, says the UN “must do better” on delivering aid to people in Gaza. A post on X , formerly known as Twitter, says Israel has expanded its capability to inspect aid being delivered via the Egyptian-controlled Rafah border crossing, and that the Israeli-controlled Kerem Shalom goods crossing is to be opened for the first time since the war began. “The aid keeps waiting at the entrance of Rafah. The UN must do better - the aid is there, and the people need it,” it adds, underneath a photo showing dozens of lorries queuing. In its latest briefing , the UN humanitarian office says the ability of its staff in Gaza to receive incoming aid has been “significantly impaired over the past few days by several factors”. “These include a shortage of trucks within Gaza; telecommunications blackouts; and the increasing number of staff who were unable to travel to the Rafah crossing due to the intensity of hostilities. ”. The UN also says aid distribution has also largely stopped outside the Rafah area over the past few days due to the fierce fighting and restrictions of movement on main roads, particularly in and around the nearby city of Khan Younis.
