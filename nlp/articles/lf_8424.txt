It's just past 06:30 in Gaza and Israel and 04:30 in London. If you're just joining us, here's a quick look at what's happened over the last few hours: Efforts to get a United Nations Security Council ceasefire motion are set to resume after Tuesday's vote was delayed. Negotiators are trying to agree on a wording that will not be vetoed by Washington - for example, by replacing the word "ceasefire" with "an urgent suspension of hostilities" The US vetoed the last draft resolution because of the language that it contained. The latest attempt to agree on a motion comes as fighting rages, with the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza saying 100 Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes across the territory on Tuesday. Aid agencies have voiced anger and frustration over the continuing plight of civilians in Gaza ahead of the vote. Israeli President Isaac Herzog has said his country is ready for another humanitarian pause but Hamas says it will not negotiate while Israel's military operation continues. Meanwhile, British Foreign Minister David Cameron will travel to Jordan and Egypt this week to push for a sustainable ceasefire , said the Foreign Office. Nearly 20,000 people are now reported to have been killed and more than 52,000 injured in Gaza since the start of the war.
