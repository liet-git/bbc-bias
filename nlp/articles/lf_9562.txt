Gaza is highly dangerous and I think this terrible incident is a function of the reluctance of occupying power Israel to institute mechanisms of law and order; to try and think hard about governance, which might involve difficult political consequences back in Israel itself. In other words, it seems to be - and remember we are not allowed into Gaza to report ourselves - a chaotic environment. When people like those aid workers move around in there they do whatâ€™s called co-ordination with the Israelis and inform them of their planned movements, their vehicles, their staff. But, my understanding from talking to aid organisations who have been operating there for months - during which many, many Palestinian aid workers have been killed - is even though they co-ordinate with Israel they still get attacked. So when there is an absence of governance, an absence of law and order, Israel going in and out and doing their military stuff and not doing other things, these kind of incidents are, sadly, going to happen because this is such a nightmarish environment.
