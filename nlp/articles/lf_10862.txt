Earlier, we reported that footage had emerged on Israeli social media, which appeared to show people surrendering to Israeli forces in the northern Gaza Strip. As our correspondent Paul Adams noted , there were two versions of the same scene - with the same man holding a rifle using a different hand in each - which raised questions about the event's authenticity. We asked the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for comment, which we have provided below. The statement was also provided in reply to separate allegations from a group of men and boys in Gaza that they were tortured while detained by Israeli soldiers. "The IDF is currently operating in the Hamas strongholds in Jabalia and Shejaiya, as part of the efforts to dismantle Hamas' military capabilities, and to rescue the hostages brutally kidnapped by the Hamas' terrorist organization. "As part of the IDF activity in the combat area, individuals suspected of involvement in terrorist activity are being detained and questioned. Individuals who are found not to be taking part in terrorist activities are released. The individuals detained are treated in accordance with international law. It is often necessary for terror suspects to hand over their clothes such that their clothes can be searched and to ensure that they are not concealing explosive vests or other weaponry.
