Tensions in the Israeli-occupied West Bank have been high since the Hamas attacks on 7 October, amid raids by the Israeli military that have resulted in hundreds of arrests and deadly attacks carried out by extremist settlers on Palestinian civilians. Today, an Israeli settler was put on administrative detention, the Israeli defence ministry said, the third such order against a settler suspected of posing a threat to national or public security since the October attacks. The man, who has not been formally identified, will be held for four months. The US, Israel’s main ally, has repeatedly warned Israeli authorities that they must act to stop violence by settlers. A day earlier, the Biden administration started imposing visa bans on dozens of individuals involved in violence in the West Bank and their families, a state department spokesman said. The policy will also deny visas to Palestinians who have committed violent acts against Israelis. Violence from settlers against Palestinians was already at a high level before the Hamas attacks, and has since worsened dramatically. Palestinians say the settlers are better armed and more aggressive, and accuse the Israeli authorities of letting them act with impunity. The international community considers all Israeli settlements as illegal under international law – though this is disputed by Israel – and their existence, and continuing expansion, is one of the key obstacles in the creation of a future Palestinian state.
