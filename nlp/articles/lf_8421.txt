Wrangles over wording delayed the UN Security Council's vote yesterday on a draft resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. The vote may be held today instead. Negotiations had aimed to avoid another veto from Washington - which stymied the Council's previous resolution calling for a ceasefire. The UK also abstained from the vote. Diplomats say one of the main sticking points has been how to frame calls for a cessation of hostilities. The original draft proposed by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) called for an "urgent and sustainable cessation of hostilities" to allow "safe and unhindered humanitarian access". Diplomats thought they were very close to an agreement but final discussions have been complex, says the UAE. The draft has already been watered down and now calls for "a suspension of hostilities" , rather than a sustainable cessation.  But it still includes a phrase calling for "urgent steps" towards a sustainable cessation of hostilities. The US, along with Israel, opposes a ceasefire because they say it would benefit Hamas. Its UN representative on Tuesday said it was "engaging constructively" on the sticking points. Deputy Ambassador Robert Wood told the BBC: "We're still working on the text with other players and I don't want to get ahead of where we are at this point. " Read more on the UN negotiations here.
