Ella Ben Ami, whose father Ohad Ben Ami is still being held hostage by Hamas, says she is hoping for a "miracle" that her father will be released. Her mother, Raz Ben Ami, 57, was taken hostage by Hamas on 7 October along with her father from Kibbutz Be'eri, and Raz was released during the temporary truce last month. Ella told Reuters news agency that her mother feels "broken" without her father despite being freed. "She just all the time speaks about my dad and how much she needs him and how much she misses him," Ella says. She says her mother came back from captivity "really thin" after eating "a meal a day or less. I know she wasn't drinking a lot because she was really dehydrated and excited from a bottle of water. " Ohad will turn 56 on 24 December, and Ella says the "Christmas miracle that I'm asking, is that my dad will come back". It is believed that more than 100 hostages remain in Gaza, and there are fresh signs that a new pause in fighting between Israel and Hamas could be possible as the Hamas chief visits Cairo today. Ella Ben Ami visits her parents' damaged house in Kibbutz Be'eri. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
