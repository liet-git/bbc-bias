These strikes, carried out by Iran, mark the first time ever that the country's fired at Israeli territory. In the middle of Saturday night, air raid alerts went off in Israel and residents were urged to seek shelter while explosions were heard as air defences were activated. Iran launched more than 300 drones and missiles, the Israeli military said the next day - including 170 drones and 30 cruise missiles. The shortest distance from Iran to Israel is about 1,000km (620 miles) across Iraq, Syria and Jordan. Interceptions lit up the night sky in several places across the country, while many of the strikes were shot down by Israel's allies before they reached Israeli territory. At least nine countries were involved in the military escalation - with projectiles fired from Iran, Iraq, Syria and Yemen and downed by Israel, the US, the UK and France as well as Jordan.
