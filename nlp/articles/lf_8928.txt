T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. We've just been hearing from Lord Peter Ricketts, a former permanent secretary at the UK Foreign Office, who was discussing the imminent UN vote on a resolution for humanitarian aid getting into Gaza. He describes the process to get even to the vote as a "marathon", referencing the lengthy negotiations between UN Security Council delegates. Ricketts tells our colleagues on the BBC News channel that the final version of the resolution, which the US last night signalled it was ready to support, may be "weaker than many would like" but it "brings the international community together". Setting out the resolution, he says its main aim is to try to "clear the blockages" preventing aid from getting into Gaza quickly. On whether the resolution will be accepted, if it's voted for, Ricketts says he believes Israel's "instant reaction" will be a refusal to "bow down to public pressure". But, he goes on, "there are limits to which Israel can go if the US has deemed this necessary". T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
