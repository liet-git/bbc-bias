The House of Commons has a rule book - Erskine May - but it is also a place of conventions and traditions. Today, Sir Lindsay Hoyle broke with convention. Opposition-day debates are designed to give opposition parties the chance to present a case and vote on it. That's why they have a slightly different procedure from other days in the Commons. The big difference is the order of the votes. What normally happens is that the government either tries to vote down an opposition motion or rewrite it by proposing an amendment. But the opposition motion is always voted on. The Speaker's decision to select both the Labour and the government amendments opens up the possibility that SNP MPs might not get the chance to vote on their own motion. That's why we saw and heard the outcry in the Commons this afternoon. It's very unusual for another opposition party to put forward changes as well. There was a debate in 2000 when there was a Liberal Democrat amendment  (but no government amendment because of a slip-up) on a Conservative opposition-day debate on asylum and immigration. The Liberal Democrat amendment was voted on first and defeated. MPs then rejected the Conservative motion. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
