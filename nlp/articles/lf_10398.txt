T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant spoke with his US counterpart - Lloyd Austin - on Sunday night, before Israel's call for civilians to leave parts of eastern Rafah. In a statement, Gallant's office says he told Austin that "military action is required" in Rafah "at the lack of an alternative", due to stalling talks over the release of Israeli hostages. Hamas has a "lack of seriousness in regard to the frameworks" for their release, the statement continues. In the Pentagon's readout of the call, it says the pair discussed "ongoing hostage negotiations, humanitarian aid, and Rafah". In the call Austin "reaffirmed" his commitment for the return of hostages to Israel, the statement continues, adding that he told Gallant there is a need for any military operation in Rafah "to include a credible plan to evacuate Palestinian civilians and maintain the flow of humanitarian aid".
