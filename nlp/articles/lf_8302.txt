T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Qatar's foreign ministry spokesman says the passing on Monday of a UN Security Council resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza has had no "immediate impact" on the ongoing negotiations between Israel and Hamas. These talks, which are aimed at agreeing a temporary truce and the release of hostages still being held by Hamas, are currently taking place in Doha with the input of mediators from Qatar, Egypt and the US. According to the Reuters news agency, sources briefed on the discussions said they were "moving ahead" and that while some of the Israeli delegation has left Doha, a smaller group of representatives remains. Israel's Haaretz newspaper also cited an Israeli source as stating that "the deal has not collapsed". However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned in a statement that the UN resolution had "damaged" the negotiations and encouraged Hamas to stick to its "delusional demands". Hamas says a ceasefire should mean the end of the war and the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, which Netanyahu rejects. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
