Thank you for following our coverage of the latest developments in the Gaza-Israel war - we will close this page shortly. This is what happened today: The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has said 22,438 people have now been killed in Gaza since the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October. The ministry also said that 14 people were killed in a blast at al-Mawasi , near Khan Younis. Al-Mawasi is a narrow strip of land in the south of the Gaza Strip which has few buildings and largely consists of sandy dunes and agricultural land. It was designated a safe zone by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) last year , though humanitarian agencies criticised the choice. The IDF has announced it has killed Mamdouh Lolo , a senior member of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) In Lebanon, the funeral of assassinated deputy Hamas leader Saleh al-Arouri has taken place. Our Middle East correspondent Hugo Bachega said that many Lebanese citizens are now wondering how the killing will affect their country - read more from Hugo here . There are concrete fears that this conflict is expanding. Yemen's Houthis are defiant after several countries warned them not to continue their Red Sea attacks , while over in Lebanon Hezbollah has said that the death of Hamas Saleh al-Arouri "won't go unpunished" .
