At the UN, the Americans are saying that they will most likely veto this resolution calling for a ceasefire. For those concerned about the significant loss of life, that does sound a bit hollow – the Americans claim the Israelis are saying they will stick to the rules of war and avoid unnecessary civilian deaths. But, they say, there is a gap between what Israel says and what it does. I think the strategy behind the secretary-general’s decision to bring a vote – which he knew would probably get vetoed – was to hurry up the inevitable moment when the Americans will say to Israel: "Enough is enough, you’ve had enough time and killed enough people and it’s time for a ceasefire. " Some diplomats I have spoken to have said they might give the Israelis another month – I think Guterres’s strategy is to try and shorten that, partly by increasing international pressure and also partly by shaming the Americans into thinking that they cannot continue to hold this position as it becomes less and less tenable.
