Jerome Mayhew, a Conservative MP from Broadland, says there is a universal desire for the violence to stop immediately. "The question is what is the most effective method to achieve that?" he asks. After mentioning that this is an SNP debate, he criticises the party for not making any reference "to the stated intention of Hamas to repeat atrocities [against Israel] again and again, similar to and worse than [what] was achieved on 7 October". "Yet again, removing Hamas from Gaza, again something the SNP motion makes no reference to, is the only way for Israelis and Palestinian to stop being killed," he argues. "The most important thing for the people in the region is an immediate cessation of violence which is achieved by a humanitarian pause," adds Mayhew, saying that will let the aid in and ensure the release of the hostages. "Hamas don't just terrorise Israelis, they terrorise Palestinians as well," Mayhew says, as he reiterates the need for a two-state solution, but acknowledges that will take time. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
