More than 250 Israelis and foreigners were kidnapped by Hamas on 7 October, according to Israel. Of those taken, 130 remain unaccounted for. On 13 February, Israel said at least 29 of them are dead. Since then another hostage, Yair Yaakov, has been confirmed to have died. Israel gives an official figure of 134 hostages because it includes four people taken hostage in 2014 and 2015. Two of these are believed to have died. We don’t know a lot about the condition of the hostages still being held by Hamas, but we have heard accounts from those who have been released so far. Yocheved Lifschitz, the 85-year-old grandmother who was released in late October said she “went through hell” in captivity. Wichian Temthong, a Thai farm worker held with the three men mistakenly killed by the IDF , said they were only fed once a day and he saw Israeli hostages being beaten with electric cables.
