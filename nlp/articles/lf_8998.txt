According to the Hamas-run health ministry, at least 86 people were killed by Israeli air strikes on the camp on Sunday , according to the UN, and that number could still rise. Speaking to public broadcaster Kan news, an Israeli military official said: "The type of munition did not match the nature of the attack, causing extensive collateral damage that could have been avoided. " They said the incident was being investigated further. Asked about the report, the IDF told the BBC that it "regrets the harm to  uninvolved individuals, and is working to draw lessons from the incident".
