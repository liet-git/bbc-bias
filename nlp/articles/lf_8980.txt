 F-N-S-T-A-R-T. 8980 F-N-E-N-D.  D-A-T-E-S-T-A-R-T. 2024-04-07 D-A-T-E-E-N-D.  T-I-T-L-E-S-T-A-R-T. What's been happening in politics this week? T-I-T-L-E-E-N-D.  T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. The corridors of Westminster have been much quieter than usual this week due to Parliament being in recess. It resumes on Monday, but let’s have a look at some of the political stories which have made headlines in the last few days: Throughout the week there has been global condemnation after an air strike in Gaza, carried out by the Israeli army, killed seven aid workers – including three British nationals. The UK has echoed calls by the charity World Central Kitchen for an independent inquiry into an Israeli airstrike on a convoy of aid vehicles. Two senior Israeli military officers have been sacked , after Israel's own investigation blamed errors, failings and violations of procedure for the deaths. The UK government has come under growing pressure to suspend arms sales to Israel following the deaths of the aid workers. More than 600 lawyers, including former Supreme Court justices, signed a letter arguing ministers risk breaching international law by continuing to allow the exports. Elsewhere, away from the Middle East conflict, senior Tory MP William Wragg has told the Times that about a year ago he gave personal phone numbers for a number of other politicians to someone he'd met on a dating app. Another Conservative MP Luke Evans has revealed he is one of the men to have been sent unsolicited explicit messages in a suspected honeytrap plot targeting Westminster. Finally, Lord Cameron has spoken in Brussels at a Nato meeting where he and other leaders discussed how best they can help Ukraine with its ongoing war against Russia - the foreign secretary has ruled out Western troops on the ground in Ukraine.
