Conservative MP Kit Malthouse is up next and says there can be no military victory over Hamas. That is widely accepted across the world and "whispered even in Israel". Every bomb that lands is a recruiting sergeant for Hamas, he says. "The UK is trapped in a crazy battle of semantics" over the wording of the calls for a ceasefire. He goes on to say that the British people think "we have no clue what we're doing any more". But what the British people want is for the killing to stop, the hostages to be returned and aid to flow into Gaza, he concludes. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
