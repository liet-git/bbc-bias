 F-N-S-T-A-R-T. 8222 F-N-E-N-D.  D-A-T-E-S-T-A-R-T. 2024-02-21 D-A-T-E-E-N-D.  T-I-T-L-E-S-T-A-R-T. Why are some MPs unhappy with the Speaker's decision? T-I-T-L-E-E-N-D.  T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. MPs have filed back into the Commons for the Gaza debate and it's already proving to be an impassioned affair. After significant consideration, the Speaker has decided that amendments from both the government and Labour will be allowed. First, the Labour amendment will be voted on. If that passes, the SNP's amended motion (effectively the same thing) will be voted on. If the original Labour amendment fails, there will be a vote on the SNP's motion, which is unlikely to pass due to opposition across the House. If both the Labour amendment and SNP motion fail, there will then be a vote on the government's amendment. This proposal has been met with outrage from the SNP, who complain their time for debate has already been cut into and now other parties' proposals will use up their time further. Owen Thompson, SNP MP for Midlothian says: "What is the point of an opposition day if it is going to be met like this?" T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
