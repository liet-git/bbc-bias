It's just passed 13:00 (12:00 GMT) here in our London newsroom. Here are the headlines so far today: An Israeli missile has struck Iran , two US officials have told the BBC's US partner CBS News. Tehran state media shared reports of explosions in the central province of Isfahan - home to a large Iranian airbase - but downplayed claims of an attack. BBC Persian shared footage showing orange flashes in the night sky above Isfahan and what appears to be bursts of anti-aircraft fire. Israel has not officially commented. Speaking at a G7 leaders' meeting in Capri, Italy, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken refused to be drawn on whether the US had prior knowledge of the attack and said the US was "not involved" in the strikes. Countries around the world - including the UK, China and Egypt - have urged calm. It follows weeks of soaring tensions between the regional rivals, which have already seen an attack on an Iranian compound in Syria - widely believed to have come from Israel - and an unprecedented assault on Israel by Iran.
