Germany's Lufthansa Airlines says it will resume flights to and from Tel Aviv, Amman and Erbil tomorrow, after it halted services to and from the Middle East yesterday amid rising tensions. Flights to Tehran and Beirut "will remain suspended until at least 18 April", the company says, adding that it will continue not to use Iranian airspace up to and including Thursday. Israel reopened its airspace yesterday morning, as did Jordan, Iraq and Lebanon, which had stopped flights for a period after Iran launched its first-ever direct assault on Israel. British airline EasyJet says it is pausing flights to and from Tel Aviv until April 21, due to "safety concerns". Read the latest on flight disruptions after Iran's attack on Israel here.
