Akram Aggour, a media and PR graduate from north Gaza, lives in a tent in Rafah with his friends. He's just sent us this message telling us how his morning in Rafah has been: Good morning. We just woke up at 07:00, me and the guys. There’s eight of us friends sleeping in the same tent. The first thing we do when we wake up is check the news. The news is contradictory, sometimes it says a ceasefire is about to happen, sometimes not. We’re all displaced from the north and we’re waiting to go home. That’s the first thing I did today.  We’re staying in a tent with no life necessities, so we try to use what we can. We store our clothes in plastic bags, we hang them off of nails. We’re trying to create makeshift solutions, as all our homes were destroyed and left behind. There’s a huge water crisis here, everyone who was displaced to the west of Rafah feels it. There’s no supplies, these places weren’t ready to receive this number of refugees. We fill up water from the water trucks every day just to get by. Akram Aggour, right, tells us supplies are running out. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
