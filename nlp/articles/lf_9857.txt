As we reported earlier, Antony Blinken says that as well as meeting Israeli political leaders, he hopes to speak with families of people taken hostage by Hamas later today. Outside the Tel Aviv hotel where the US Secretary of State has been having talks with Israel's president, several dozen protestors held up banners calling for a ceasefire to secure the release of the 132 people still being held in Gaza. And in another sign of the strength of feeling in Israel about the plight of the hostages, photos from the south of the country show people demonstrating against humanitarian aid for Gaza at a crossing point for trucks entering the territory.
