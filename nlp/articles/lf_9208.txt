It has posted a video on Telegram showing one of its reporters standing on the top of a building in the centre of the city of Isfahan. "The city is safe and sound, people are living their normal lives," he says. "A couple of hours ago sounds were heard in the skies. From what we know, multiple mini drones were flying in the skies of Isfahan when they were targeted. "So far, provincial authorities have not given us any information. Some outlets had said that Isfahan's nuclear facilities were targeted, but based on our research this information is false, no place has been targeted. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
