T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak says the UK is "deeply concerned" about a possible Israeli offensive in Rafah "given the number of civilians that are sheltering there". He adds that he has expressed his concerns to Israel and has called for a pause in fighting to allow aid into Gaza. "I've made those points repeatedly to PM Netanyahu," he says. "The priority right now should be on all parties - but particularly Hamas - to agree to a deal to release hostages and allow more aid to go in as part of a temporary pause which will allow us to build a sustainable ceasefire".
