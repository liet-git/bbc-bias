Hamas's statement that it accepts a ceasefire proposal came as weeks of mediated talks seemed to have stalled. Negotiations have been arduous, involving not just Hamas and Israel indirectly but also the US, Qatar and Egypt. At this point, it is unclear exactly what Hamas means it accepts, but in recent days unconfirmed reports spoke of a phased agreement which would see dozens of Israeli hostages released in return for a much greater number of Palestinian prisoners in Israel amid a pause in the fighting. Hamas had been holding out for a complete end to the war but Israel has made clear that is something which it can't accept, since it would allow Hamas to survive. Hamas's statement came hours after Israel, for the first time, ordered Palestinians to evacuate from part of the southern Gaza city of Rafah in preparation for an operation - a move which could have put increased pressure on Hamas to avert that.
