It's just after 19:00 in Israel and Gaza and 17:00 here in London. Here's a quick recap of what's been happening today: Rocket attacks have been launched against Jerusalem for the first time since 30 October. The country's Iron Dome defence system intercepted the missiles. Earlier, Israel said it would allow aid into Gaza through the Kerem Shalom crossing, a move praised by the White House. The Israeli offensive has continued in Gaza on Friday, with residents reporting fighting in northern, central and southern Gaza. Israeli military said it had recovered the bodies of two Israeli soldiers, Nik Beizer and Ron Scherman, and civilian Elia Toledano, who had all been taken hostage by Hamas when the group launched its cross-border attacks on southern Israel on 7 October. Elsewhere, White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan met Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, who said Gaza must remain an "integral part" of the Palestinian state. In other news, Danish shipping company Maersk said it was pausing all journeys through the Red Sea after a spate of attacks on vessels from a part of Yemen controlled by the Iran-backed Houthis. The Houthis, who have declared their support for Hamas, say they have been targeting ships travelling to Israel. It is the first time since 30 October that Jerusalem (pictured) has been targeted by rockets. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
