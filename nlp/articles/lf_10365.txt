The White House is scheduled to hold a press briefing at 14:15 EST (18:15 GMT) today, which will likely include national security communications advisor John Kirby. Israel's operation in Rafah and news of a potential ceasefire deal are likely to feature prominently. As we reported earlier, US President Joe Biden held a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in which he reiterated his "clear" position that the US does not support an invasion of Rafah without a plan for the civilians that are located there. Earlier, Biden was also scheduled to have a private lunch with King Abdullah of Jordan. In the evening, Biden and his wife Jill are scheduled to host a Cinco de Mayo event at the White House.
