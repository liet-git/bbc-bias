Earlier we reported on an attack on a Norwegian tanker off the coast of Yemen - we're now hearing that the Iran-backed Houthi rebels have claimed responsibility. The group targeted the tanker with a rocket after the crew "refused to respond to all warnings", Reuters has reported, citing Houthi military spokesperson Yehia Sareea. He also claimed the tanker was carrying oil to Israel, according to GLZ Radio, and said the Houthis had obstructed the passage of several ships in recent days. The group said last week that it will target all ships heading north to Israel. It has also warned international shipping companies against dealing with Israeli ports. All 22 crew members on board the Strinda vessel are unhurt, its owner Mowinckel Chemical Tankers told Reuters. The ship is now headed for a safe port, the company said. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
