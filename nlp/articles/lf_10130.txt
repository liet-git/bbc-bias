We'll soon be wrapping up our live coverage of the ongoing Israel-Gaza war for the day, but before we go let's take a look at some of today's main headlines: A senior commander with the Islamist Hezbollah movement, Wissam Tawil was killed, purportedly in an Israeli drone strike, in southern Lebanon. Reports from Lebanese media suggest a car that Tawil was reportedly in was targeted in the Khibert Selm vicinity before veering off the road and catching fire. Separately, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu says he will do "whatever is necessary to restore security to the north" of Israel - near the border with Lebanon. On the ground in Gaza , the Hamas-run health ministry says more than 23,000 Palestinians have been killed in the densely populated enclave since Israel started its retaliatory offensive. A spokeswoman for the United Nations' humanitarian agency told the BBC the situation in the only medical facility in central Gaza - al-Aqsa hospital - is "dire" and "just a single doctor" is working in the hospital's emergency department. The International Rescue Committee had to pull its medics from the same hospital, because the Israeli military increase its activities near the hospital. A video released by al-Quds brigades published a video that purports to have Israeli national Elad Katzir speaking from captivity in Gaza. Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in the Middle East, where he's had talks with leaders in the UAE and Saudi Arabia before he heads to Israel. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
