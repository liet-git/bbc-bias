The UK government has summoned the Israeli ambassador in London to the Foreign Office following the deaths of aid workers in Gaza. The ambassador attended the Foreign Commonwealth and Development Offices where Andrew Mitchell, the minister for development and Africa, "set out the Government's unequivocal condemnation of the appalling killing of seven World Central Kitchen aid workers, including three British Nationals". "Today, I summoned the Ambassador of the Israeli Embassy in London to the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office," Mitchell said, adding that he'd "requested a quick and transparent investigation, shared with the international community, and full accountability". "I reiterated the need for Israel to put in place an effective deconfliction mechanism immediately and urgently to scale up humanitarian access. We need to see an immediate humanitarian pause, to get aid in and the hostages out, then progress towards a sustainable ceasefire. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
