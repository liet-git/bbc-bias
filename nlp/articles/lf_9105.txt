As we've been reporting , the Hamas-run health ministry says 14 people - including nine children - have been killed in an Israeli strike in Al-Mawasi, west of Khan Younis in Gaza's south. Al-Mawasi is a narrow strip of land which has few buildings and largely consists of sandy dunes and agricultural land. It was designated a safe zone by the Israel Defense Forces last year, though humanitarian agencies said it was too small and lacking in infrastructure for them to be able to support displaced people effectively there. The IDF has said that on 6 December Hamas "launched a rocket from a humanitarian zone toward Israel", and released a map with al-Mawasi marked. The BBC has not been able to independently verify this.
