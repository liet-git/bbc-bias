Following the vote in the UN Security Council, Israel now has more time to continue its military operation in Gaza - and whether it’s a month, three months, or more, I think judging at the pace things are going, Israel may well struggle to achieve its military objectives. It will be messy. There won’t be an easy end. There won’t be a moment when Israel says it’s time to go home and rebuild, which is the kind of thing that happened before in the wars between Hamas and Israel. This is of a totally different order of magnitude. That’s why the future is unknown territory for everyone involved in this. Hamas is continuing to fire rockets into Israeli areas, but also fighting Israeli troops street by street in Gaza, inflicting casualties. Israel has tremendous military power. In a 24-hour period this week, it says it hit Gaza 450 times by land, sea and air - and that is an enormous amount of power and destruction. But what it has not so far done is show it can break Hamas as a military organisation with a military chain of command. Then, perhaps, Israeli could claim victory. But right now, Hamas is still fighting in an organised way, which will dismay those Israelis who want this to be over and done with. And an issue Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is going to have, is that they have set a very high bar for victory – annihilate Hamas. Not just as a military organisation, but as a group that has a political role as well. Since those ideas are pretty much embedded among some Palestinians, that might be pretty much impossible.
