Labour's Debbie Abraham is now chiming in to say that she was "ashamed to be an MP" during yesterday's Commons row, but she swiftly moves on to use her time to question Penny Mordaunt about the potential for a new debate on Gaza. Mordaunt responds to this by saying that there will be "ample opportunities" to hold discussions on Gaza. She also adds that she isn't ashamed of being an MP, despite what happened, before taking a jab at the Labour Party. "I think if I was a member of the Labour Party, I'd be ashamed of that," she says.
