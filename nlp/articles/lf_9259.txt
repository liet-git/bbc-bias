While the focus of the Israeli ground operation seems to be in the south, hundreds of tank shells hit Jabalia refugee camp in the north. The situation in the biggest refugee camp is terribly difficult, hundreds of tanks are surrounding the densely populated area according to witnesses. The Hamas-run local authority said about 100,000 people are still in the camp without a functioning hospital and at risk of starvation. No aid has reached the north since the humanitarian truce has collapsed, very little food and fuel were allowed during the truce. Fifty-six year-old Hanan Alturok, a mother of eight, lives close to Jabalia. She told the BBC: “During the ceasefire we moved to the hospital, we thought it's safer than my house but yesterday the shells were landing inside the place and we had to flee under fire. “My husband Maher was killed on 29 November when he was trying to buy some food from the local market, I don’t know what to do or where to go, I have no money and no food and very little drinking water. "I’m afraid that my kids will die from hunger. " The director general of the Hamas-run Health Ministry, Dr Munir Al-Bursh, said: “Yesterday, we dug a mass grave in Jabalia market for more than 100 martyrs, whose bodies rotted in the besieged Kamal Adwan Hospital. "All of the northern hospitals are out of service, including the last functionining hospital, Kamal Adwan, which was heavily bombed by artillery shells. " Israel's attacks on Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza have left dozens of structures in ruins. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
