The health ministry in Gaza, which is controlled by Hamas, says more than 50,000 people have been injured since the Israeli offensive began - in addition to more than 18,400 whoâ€™ve been killed. The UN and aid agencies have been documenting some of the problems obstructing the treatment of the injured. A global disability charity, Humanity and Inclusion, says that amputations, burns and traumatic brain injuries have been caused from the use of explosive weapons in Gaza. The charity says the lack of medical care and painkillers means that many people suffer needlessly and may develop long-term impairments that could have been avoided. Only about 400 of the most seriously wounded have so far been evacuated abroad, according to an Israeli group, Physicians for Human Rights Israel. The World Health Organization (WHO) has also blamed Israeli forces for causing lengthy delays at checkpoints in allowing emergency vehicles carrying the wounded to pass.
