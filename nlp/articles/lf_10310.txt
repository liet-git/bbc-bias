T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. A former Israeli MP for Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party says he believes if Hamas is serious about accepting a deal which would see all hostages returned to Israel, then Israel would sign the deal too. Michael Kleiner, who's now president of the Likud party's internal court, tells BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Israel can't declare victory in its military action against Hamas until all of the hostages are home. But at the moment, Israeli officials will be examining how "serious" Hamas is in accepting the proposal for a new Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal with Israel, he says. Meanwhile in Rafah, Kleiner adds, "the pace of the activity. . . will not be accelerated, just preparation action, not full scale war". "If (Hamas leader) Sinwar is serious, there will be a deal," he says. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
