The Israeli military says it has killed a senior Hezbollah commander in an air strike on southern Lebanon. Ali Ahmed Hassin was targeted in an attack near the village of Sultaniyeh, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) claims in a post on X, formerly Twitter. "Two more terrorists who were under his command" were also killed, according to the IDF, which accuses Hassin of "the planning and execution" of various attacks against Israel. Hezbollah is yet to respond publicly to news of Hassin's death. The Shia Muslim organisation has considerable political influence and controls the most powerful armed force in Lebanon. Its relationship with Israel is contentious - in 2006, a full-blown war broke out after Hezbollah carried out a deadly raid. Since the war with Hamas began in October, it has exchanged sporadic cross-border fire with the Israeli military. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
