Labour MP Barry Sheerman is now calling for a review into yesterday's events in the House of Commons, which he says he's "not seen" in his time on the bench. He says that his fellow MPs "should learn" from the behaviour that was on display Wednesday during the ceasefire vote, adding that it was "awful" and "rowdy". Penny Mordaunt agrees with the Labour MP's characterisation by saying that what took place yesterday is "completely shameful". She adds that though she wants to "take the heat out of this", she will continue to advocate for all members of Parliament to be able to express their views. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
