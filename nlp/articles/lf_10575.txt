T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Jordan's foreign minister says the international community should stop Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu from "stealing" attention away from the war in Gaza by escalating its confrontation with Iran. Ayman Safadi says Iran was responding to the attack against its consulate and had announced it "did not want to escalate further". "We are against escalating. Netanyahu wants to draw attention away from Gaza and focus on his confrontation with Iran," Safadi told reporters at a press conference in Berlin. Netanyahuâ€™s office has said the international community "must continue to stand united in resisting this Iranian aggression, which threatens world peace". As a reminder, Jordan helped shoot down Iran's attack on Israel over the weekend - but its leaders have also previously criticised Israel's war in Gaza. On helping thwart Iran's attack, Safadi earlier said: "If the danger had come from Israel, Jordan would have taken the same measures. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
