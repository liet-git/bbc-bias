This tragic error by Israeli forces in Gaza throws an uncomfortable spotlight on the Israeli government’s controversial efforts to recover its hostages alive. The official policy is that the best way to get them out of Gaza is to continue putting military pressure on Hamas. But relatives of the hostages, who vented their anger outside the Ministry of Defence in Tel Aviv last night, worry that this is proving counter-productive. One of their banners read: ‘Every day a hostage dies’. So far, 110 hostages have been released from Gaza – all through negotiation, mostly brokered by Qatar but also by Egypt, with additional involvement by the CIA. But once Israel resumed its military campaign after the recent 7-day pause it has proved very hard indeed to find and free the remaining 100-plus hostages, held both above and below ground in this densely packed residential area. So now there is pressure on the government to resume negotiations and there are reports that the head of Israel’s spy agency, Mossad, may soon be meeting the Qatari PM to discuss the issue.
