Humanitarian conditions continue to deteriorate in Gaza and there is now a serious risk of famine, according to aid agencies. One of them, Unicef, says 325,000 children under the age of five are at risk of acute malnutrition. "Unicef expects that in the coming days and weeks there will be at least 10,000 children whose lives are essentially at risk if the situation does not change," said regional chief of advocacy Ammar Ammar. One woman, Hana Tabash, who was displaced from Khan Younis, told the Reuters news agency her two-year-old daughter weighs seven kilograms (one stone) - less than half what is considered a healthy weight for a girl her age. My daughter can't handle being in crowded places, she needs oxygen - and we can't get her the required treatment. She needs fresh air, oxygen, to strengthen her immune system, because her immunity is currently weak. . . she also doesn't walk. I don't know what to say. Our situation is tragic. Hana Tabash. Hana Tabash is living in a tent with her malnourished daughter. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
