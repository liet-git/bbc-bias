Families of the two hostages, who were seen in a video released by Islamic Jihad on Tuesday, say they are glad to see their loved ones alive, but are also worried about their health. Elad Katzir, 47, was one of the hostages seen in the video. His sister, Carmit Palty Katzir, says: "I have mixed emotions: A sign of life! But I am also beset with worry and rage". In a post on social media, Carmit Katzir writes: "It sears into my flesh. The humiliation. His life is not his own. He looks weak, emaciated, down. I know I should be grateful, many families don't have anything, not even a signal of life. " She adds: "Bring him back already!" Yair Mozes, son of the other hostage seen in the video, Gadi Moses, 79, says "the family is delighted, on the one hand, to get a first sign of life. On the other hand, he looks exhausted and emaciated, which is extremely worrying. " Speaking to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, he says "a deal is needed to secure the release of as many [hostages] as quickly as possible". In the video, both men warned that Israelâ€™s bombings were endangering their lives but Yair believes what his father said were "words he was ordered to speak". Gadi Mozes. Elad Katzir.
