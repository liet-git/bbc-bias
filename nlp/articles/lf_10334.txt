It's been a rollercoaster on the diplomatic front on Monday. First, Hamas stated it had agreed to a ceasefire plan drawn up through indirect talks facilitated by US, Qatar and Egypt. Israel then quickly rejected the deal, which has not been made public. Perhaps crucially, however, Israel did say it would send a delegation to Cairo for more (indirect) talks. Qatar, the state where Hamas' leadership is based, confirmed that its delegates would return on Tuesday. "The Qatari delegation will head to Cairo on Tuesday morning to resume indirect negotiations between the two parties," the Qatari foreign ministry said. It added that the diplomats "hope that the talks will culminate in reaching an agreement for an immediate and permanent ceasefire in the Gaza strip". T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
