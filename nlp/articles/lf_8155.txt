The Leader of the Commons Penny Mordaunt has just told MPs the government will "play no further part in today's proceedings". She added the government's position in Israel and Gaza remained unchanged. This suggests the government's amendment to the SNP motion will not go to a vote. That could then mean that Labour's amendment, which the SNP pledged to support earlier this evening, could pass. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
