The United Nations estimates that almost two million people - most of the population of Gaza - have had to flee due to the conflict. As the war began last October, Israel ordered civilians to evacuate, issuing evacuation warnings to the population. BBC analysis has found significant errors in the warnings issued by Israel and experts say these mistakes could violate Israel’s international law obligations. Civilians living north of the Wadi Gaza riverbed, including Gaza City, were warned to evacuate in October. Many headed south after the Erez border crossing into Israel in the north was closed, but Israeli forces have recently been focusing on southern cities. The main urban areas, Khan Younis and Rafah, have been bombed, and Israeli troops have clashed with Hamas fighters on the ground. Civilians, including thousands who fled fighting in the north, have been told to moved to a so-called “safe area” at al-Mawasi, a thin strip of land along the Mediterranean coast, close to the Egyptian border. The UN says more than half of Gaza’s population is crammed into Rafah - previously a town of 250,000 people - where living conditions are “abysmal”. Read more here. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
