There are now four flashpoints in the Middle East that could each lead independently to a broader and even more deadly conflict in the region. The most recent are the unexplained explosions in Iran that have led to the deaths of over 100 people today. It would make no sense for Israel to have done this, risking a new front when it already has its hands full. But as Iran hunts down the perpetrators it will inevitably raise tensions in the region. Then there is Tuesday’s targeted assassination of the Hamas No. 2 in Beirut, Saleh Al-Arouri. Hamas is already at war with Israel but the question now is whether this provokes the powerful Lebanese militia Hezbollah to respond against Israel by stepping up its cross-border attacks. Then there are the Houthis in Yemen, who show no sign of stopping their missile attacks on ships they believe are connected to Israel. This may well lead to a US-led military strike on their launch sites. And finally there is Gaza, where Israel has vowed to continue its operations for months, while the EU’s top diplomat has said Israel’s military response to the 7 October attacks had “exceeded the limits of what can be understood as the right to defend itself” and that “a solution to the conflict needs to be imposed from the outside”.
