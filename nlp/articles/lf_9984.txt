Markets in northern Gaza are witnessing a good recovery after Israel opened the Erez crossing - one of two new humanitarian routes - and allowed the entry of goods, including medicines and fuel. A video posted to TikTok shows a man grilling meat and chicken in a restaurant in Jabalia camp, which has opened its doors for the first time in six months. In the clip, local activist Hussein Odeh says: “Grills with their delicious smell have returned again after the availability of meat and chicken at slightly high prices, but they are not comparable to before. It is 55 shekels (£12) for a kilo of frozen veal now. ”. In another video, Odeh adds: "Life has gradually begun to return to the main camp market. There are many food products, vegetables, fruits and meat. Prices have begun to decrease after the opening of the Erez crossing. " Correction: This post says aid got into Gaza via the recently opened Erez crossing, but aid trucks actually entered via an opening made in nearby fencing. Erez itself is not currently officially functioning. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
