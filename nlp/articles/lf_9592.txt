We earlier brought you reaction from Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz - here's some more from his statement. "Today’s decision sends a message to the Palestinians and the world: terrorism pays," he says. "After the Hamas terror organisation carried out the largest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust, after committing heinous sexual crimes witnessed by the world, these countries chose to reward Hamas and Iran by recognizing a Palestinian state. "This distorted step by these countries is an injustice to the memory of the victims of 7/10, a blow to efforts to return the 128 hostages, and a boost to Hamas and Iran's jihadists, which undermines the chance for peace and questions Israel’s right to self-defence.
