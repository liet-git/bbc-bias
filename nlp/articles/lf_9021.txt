Police at Portland State University are trying to clear the library which had been taken over by protesters who used furniture to barricade themselves inside. Police have made two arrests outside the library and are still trying to clear the library. They said attempts to speak with the protesters inside were unsuccessful. The university has warned those who remain inside the library that they are criminally trespassing. As well as Israel, the protest on this campus have also stemmed from ties the university has with aerospace company Boeing, which was once headquartered on the west coast. University President Ann Cudd wrote a letter to the campus community earlier this week announcing the university will pause gifts or grants from Boeing until they meet to debate at a forum later this month.
