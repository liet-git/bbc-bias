An opposition politician in the Israeli Knesset has said she hopes the country's allies "will stand by Israel and continue to support us" amid international criticism of how the country is handling the war. Shelly Tal Meron is a member of Yesh Atid, the main opposition party in the Israeli parliament, tells Radio 4's World at One programme that when it comes to "the national security of the state of Israel, we are all in agreement" that Hamas needs to be eradicated. "Israel has to defend itself, has to defend its borders, and has to do everything in its power to return our hostages," she says. Asked about whether control of aid into Gaza was a weapon of war that could be used by Israel, Tal Meron says Israel "does not want to harm civilians" and its forces "do not target them". "When civilians get hurt, it is horrible, it shouldn't happen," she says, "but we do not target them on purpose in any way. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
