The World Health Organization (WHO) says it is "terribly worried" about what is happening at al-Shifa hospital. In a post on social media, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus says the situation at the hospital is "endangering health workers, patients and civilians". He says al-Shifa had only recently restored "minimal health services", and that any hostilities or militarisation of the hospital "jeopardize health services, access for ambulances, and delivery of life-saving supplies". "Hospitals should never be battlegrounds," he says, ending the post with: "Hospitals must be protected. Ceasefire!" T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
