T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Let's hear more from the questioning of UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron - this time by the Foreign Affairs Committee chair, Alicia Kearns. In response to her questions, he declined to say whether he had seen any Foreign Office legal advice stating that Israel has breached international humanitarian law in Gaza. The foreign secretary went on to MPs it was not his job to make a "legal adjudication". Cameron did say that he had seen things during the war that have been "deeply concerning" and he also called on Israel to restore water supply to Gaza. But he would not be drawn on whether the deprivation of water breached humanitarian law, saying: "It is just something they ought to do, in my view. " Israel should turn water back on in Gaza - Lord Cameron. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
