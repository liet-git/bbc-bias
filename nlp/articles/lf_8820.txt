T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Oxfam America's CEO says US President Joe Biden's administration has missed an opportunity to "live up to its lofty rhetoric supporting human rights and a rules-based international order". In a statetment, Abby Maxman says the world is "ready for the horrific carnage in Gaza to end and focus on the release of hostages and helping Palestinians rebuild their lives". The US veto of the UN's ceasefire resolution puts "another nail in the coffin for US credibility on matters of human rights," adds Maxman. Maxman says the US has "rightly maintained that Israel has the right to defend its people from attacks," but says the White House "has not leveraged its special relationship with Israel to end this spiraling crisis". The Oxfam director calls for "a future without the threat of another October 7 attack or crushing blockade". T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
