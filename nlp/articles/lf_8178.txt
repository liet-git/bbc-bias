T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Conservative Steve Double says everyone wants to see a ceasefire in Gaza, and no one wants to see an  Israeli escalation in Rafah. But a real ceasefire has to mean Hamas laying down its weapons - otherwise it is an "Israeli surrender" - and Hamas is very unlikely to do that, he adds. Double says a ceasefire existed on 6 October until Hamas broke it by killing more than 1,200 Israelis and committing the "most despicable" sexual assaults. The SNP motion is "glaring", he adds, in its lack of condemnation of Hamas, which remains an obstacle to peace and a two-state solution. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
