Wichian Temthong, 37, one of the 23 freed Thai hostage that have returned to their homeland, has told the BBC he was “very shocked” and “saddened” to learn about the deaths of the three Israeli hostages mistakenly killed on Friday. Wichian, a Thai worker who was sent to Israel only 10 days before the Hamas attack, said he was captured from Kibbutz Kfar Aza on 7 October and was the only Thai held hostage with three other Israeli hostages. He spent nearly 50 days in Gaza with the three men whose names he remembered as Yotam, who did a drumming gesture to tell Wichian he was a musician; Alon, and Sammy. He said two of them joined him since the first day of detention and the third one came on the third day. We couldn’t speak each other’s languages, so we mostly did hand signals and drawing to communicate. " Wichian said all four of them would shake hands and did a hand gesture to say “keep on fighting” every day to boost their moral support. He said that while he was spared from any beating in detention, he saw some of his fellow Israeli hostages beaten by the guards with electrical wires. Wichian said each of them were fed one piece of pita bread and one date per day when they were kept in the first tunnel for 40 days. When they were moved to the second tunnel, they were given a loaf of bread to share among themselves. He said they hugged him goodbye when Wichian learned he was going to be released on 26 November. People protested in Tel Aviv last night after the news that three hostages had been mistakenly killed by Israeli military. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
