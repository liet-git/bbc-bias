Raghad Muhammad Fadl, 12, says that as bombs fell above her home in northern Gaza, she moved to Khan Younis in the south because she was told the area was safe. “We departed with tears in our eyes and nothing else,” she tells BBC Arabic. Arriving in Khan Younis, instead of going to school, she began working so she could buy food. Then the bombing returned and she was forced to move again – this time to Rafah, near the Egyptian border. Through tears she says: “Life is tragic. The bombing and the sounds we hear at night make us unable to sleep. I am a child who leads a miserable life. How can I describe it? I will never be able to forget this war. ”. Many Gazans have fled Khan Younis for Rafah, near the Egyptian border. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
