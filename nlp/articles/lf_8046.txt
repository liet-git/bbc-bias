Yesterday Antony Blinken was in Cairo for, what he called, “productive” talks with ministers from a number of Arab countries. Speaking at a press conference, he said the gaps were “narrowing" in ongoing talks aimed at reaching a ceasefire in Gaza, alongside the release of hostages being held by Hamas. “There’s still difficult work to get there, but I continue to believe it‘s possible,” Blinken said, adding that the US was in agreement with its Arab allies for the need for a ceasefire. A planned major military operation by Israel in the Gazan city of Rafah would be "a mistake", Blinken said, calling it "unnecessary". America’s top diplomat also called on Israel “to do more" to allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza, where he said the entire population faced severe levels of food insecurity. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
