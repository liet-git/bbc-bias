T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. The withdrawal of troops from Khan Younis comes as Israel faces growing international pressure to de-escalate the conflict. The Israeli defence minister said soldiers had left the city, the largest in southern Gaza, to prepare for future operations against Hamas. It is still not clear what this could mean for a possible incursion into the overcrowded town of Rafah, where more than a million Palestinians are sheltering. Israel says an offensive there is essential to defeat Hamas, but the UN and the US have warned that a major operation could lead to a humanitarian disaster. In Cairo, efforts to agree a ceasefire deal continue. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
