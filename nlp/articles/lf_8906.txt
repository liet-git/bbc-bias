T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. After days of tense diplomatic negotiations, the United Nations Security Council has finally agreed to a resolution to get more aid into Gaza. The text calls for "safe and unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance at scale". To get that aid in as fast as possible, the resolution also calls for the creation of "conditions for a sustainable cessation of hostilities". But it does not call for a ceasefire. The resolution calls for all parties to facilitate the use of routes across the Gaza Strip, including border crossings, “for the provision of humanitarian assistance". It also mentions the creation of a UN humanitarian coordinator role to oversee aid into Gaza. Israel will still be involved in this process. After the vote, UN chief Antonio Guterres said the “real problem” for UN aid efforts has been Israel’s offensive, which he says has created “massive obstacles”. “A humanitarian ceasefire is the only way to begin to meet the desperate needs of people in Gaza and end their ongoing nightmare,” he added.
