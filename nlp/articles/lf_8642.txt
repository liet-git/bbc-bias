Israel will “operate against Hamas leaders wherever they are”. That was Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s warning in November. Saleh al-Arouri, Hamas's deputy leader who was killed in Beirut yesterday, was known to be on Israel’s hit lit. He was on the US’s black list too, with a bounty of $5m ($3.9m) on his head since 2018. Israel doesn’t usually confirm or deny operations like this, but this long conflict is a history of assassinations. Even before this war with Hamas erupted, Hezbollah’s leader Hassan Nasrallah warned that any targeted attack on Lebanese soil would trigger a “powerful response". He and his Iranian allies know their response now could change the shape of this war. Hezbollah has tried to confine its engagement to the southern border with Israel to avoid drawing Lebanon into another costly conflagration. But this attack, in Beirut’s southern suburbs, against the Hamas official who was a key link to Hezbollah and Iran, has jolted its calculations. Al-Arouri’s death must also be concentrating minds in Turkey and Qatar where Hamas leaders are also based, believing they’d be safer there. Calls for restraint grow louder as the shadows stretching over this region grow longer, darker. To remind yourself what Hezbollah is, head here. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
