Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen are engaging in Oman-mediated talks with "international parties" over its ongoing "operations" in the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea, a spokesman for the group says. Spokesperson Mohamed Abdel-Salam says the group will continue to target Israeli vessels or ships bound for Israel until the "aggression and siege" on Gaza end. Four of the world's five-largest shipping companies have now suspended their vessels from travelling through the Red Sea, because of missile attacks from Houthi rebels. The Houthis have targeted foreign ships in the area since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. They have declared support for Hamas and have said they were targeting ships travelling to Israel.
