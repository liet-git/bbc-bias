Sharone Lifschitz, whose 83-year-old father Oded is still missing, presumed to be held captive in the Gaza Strip, says she's not hopeful about truce talks continuing because "there are extremists on both sides that can derail it". Speaking to BBC 4's Today programme, she says she hopes Israel's government will follow what the majority of Israeli citizens want and "bring this deal so that our loved ones could come back". Sharone's mother was freed from Hamas captivity in Gaza in October but she says her family hasn't had proof of life for her father since the 20th day of his captivity. "If my father is alive it is a miracle, we can’t wait to have him back, we can’t wait to hug him," says Lifschitz. If it doesn’t happen now it is going to take very long. We know some of them are dead, we know that they are in harm's way every day and every hour. We need to find a way to negotiate long term deals to provide the security of citizens of Israel and Palestine. I urge the government to do all it can to bring back our people.
