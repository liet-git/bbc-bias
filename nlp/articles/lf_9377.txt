Aseel Mousa, 26, in Rafah, has sent us pictures from her morning spent baking bread over fire. She tells us: I woke up at 06:30 in Rafah, prayed and because I had electricity and internet connection I seized the chance and did some work. After that, I started helping my mum to make bread. Before the war we used to buy bread, now we make it in our homes.  We get wood, start a fire, make dough, put it into portions, let it rise. This is what weâ€™re doing now. This process takes at least three hours. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
