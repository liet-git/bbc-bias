A group of "mid-ranking" Israeli envoys will go to Cairo in the next few hours to see if Hamas can be persuaded to change its latest ceasefire offer, a senior Israeli official tells Reuters news agency. The official reiterates that the current proposal is unacceptable, adding: "This delegation is made up of mid-level envoys. Were there a credible deal in the offing, the principals would be heading the delegation. " Hamas said yesterday that it would accept a deal drawn up by Egyptian mediators, but it's not clear what exactly is in the deal Hamas has agreed to and Israel rejected the proposal, saying it was "far from meeting" its "core demands".
