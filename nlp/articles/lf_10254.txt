A meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US national security adviser Jake Sullivan is under way in Tel Aviv. Sullivan arrived in Israel for talks with top officials, as Israeli forces continue the offensive against Hamas in Gaza and disagreements with the US deepen. Yesterday, Netanyahu said nothing would stop the war, in reference to growing international pressure for a ceasefire amid mounting civilian casualties and a severe humanitarian crisis. Sullivan is expected to push for a timeline for the end of the war and for Israel to increase efforts to protect civilians. The visit happens just days after President Joe Biden made his strongest comments yet about the Israeli military conduct, saying Israel was starting to lose support internationally with its “indiscriminate bombing” of Gaza, something that has been rejected by Israel. Gaps are also widening over who should govern post-war Gaza. The US supports the view that the Palestinian Authority, which currently administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, take over control of Gaza - something that Netanyahu has rejected for now. Some in Israeli media suggest that Netanyahu, by openly disagreeing with the Biden administration, is trying to appeal to his right-wing base. Netanyahu, who is on trial for corruption charges, is under pressure for the security failings that did not prevent the Hamas attacks on 7 October. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
