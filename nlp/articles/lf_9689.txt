Negotiations for a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel were already deadlocked but have looked in peril in recent weeks. Earlier this month, Hamas announced it agreed to a ceasefire proposal and said the "ball is now in Israel's court". However, Israel said the deal that Hamas's leadership had approved had not been agreed to by it negotiators, including its provisions on releasing hostages and the terms around a "permanent" ceasefire. It has long been the position of the US - which has helped to mediate these discussions, along with Egypt and Qatar - that any deal must include the release of prisoners. In the meantime, Israel has pressed ahead with its military offensive in Rafah, despite international pressure to call it off and avoid more civilian deaths. Hamas has signalled in recent days it would take part in further talks as long as the Rafah offensive continues. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
