Jamie McGoldrick, the UN’s humanitarian coordinator, also warned of imminent famine in Gaza, as reported by the UN’s food security monitor earlier today, but said it could be averted if there was an "enabling environment" for aid supplies. He called for all road crossings into Gaza to be opened, warning that air and sea deliveries would not be sufficient. Responding to questions about Israel’s claims that it has "no limits" on the amount of aid that can enter Gaza, McGoldrick said UN supplies of medical equipment, solar panels, chemicals for water sanitation and even communication equipment for UN aid workers, had all been prevented from entering Gaza. He added that food supplies, already limited by the restricted road crossings, were regularly held up at Israeli checkpoints. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
