As we've been reporting, Israel is urging about 100,000 people in the eastern part of Rafah, in southern Gaza, to move to expanded humanitarian areas in the al-Mawasi and Khan Younis areas. Israel is describing the move as a "limited and temporary" evacuation of civilians from parts of the city of Rafah, which has seen its population grow to 1.4 million people - with many Gazans seeking refuge there. Our updated map below shows the locations of these areas within the Gaza Strip, including the al-Mawasi humanitarian zone, the expanded humanitarian area and the evacuation zone. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
