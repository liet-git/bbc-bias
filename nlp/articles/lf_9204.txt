All week there’s been speculation about when and how Israel would retaliate for last weekend's unprecedented Iranian attack – which brought the shadow war between these two long-time enemies dangerously into the open. Now, Iran’s Fars news agency says explosions have been heard near an army base in the city of Isfahan – activating local air defence systems. Flights are reported to have been suspended over several Iranian cities. On Saturday night, Iran launched more than 300 attack drones and missiles at Israel. With the help of allies, most were downed before reaching Israeli territory. Israeli officials had indicated that they had to hit back for Iran’s strike to deter it from acting again. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
