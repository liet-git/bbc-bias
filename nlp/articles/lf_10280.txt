Let’s bring you up to speed on what’s happened so far today: Ceasefire talks are resuming in Cairo with Israel and Hamas both sending their delegations. Israel said the proposal was not the same as the one it had already accepted, and was not acceptable in its current form. Exact details of the proposal have not been made public, but an Israeli official briefed on the details said Israel objected to the proposal of a “permanent” ceasefire , saying female soldiers would be released too late in the process, and it said releasing bodies – rather than hostages – was unacceptable. A senior Hamas official said talks in Cairo would be Israel's "last chance" to release its hostages. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has instructed his delegation to "stand firm" on the conditions necessary to release the hostages and that will guarantee Israel's security. On the ground in eastern Rafah, Israel has been directing about 100,000 people out to expanded “humanitarian areas” to enable it to continue with its operation targeting Hamas. The Israeli army has also taken "operational control" of the Gaza side of the Rafah crossing with Egypt. The UN has called for both the Rafah and Kerem Shalom crossings in southern Gaza – both vital for humanitarian aid deliveries - to be reopened. Kerem Shalom has been closed since it came under Hamas rocket attacks on Sunday and Tuesday morning. National security spokesman John Kirby said the US had made clear its opposition to a large-scale operation in Rafah . The US said it was working hard to ensure aid could pass through the Rafah crossing , while Israel had committed to reopening Kerem Shalom at President Joe Biden’s request, he told reporters.
