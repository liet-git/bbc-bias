Heads of aid agencies are making impassioned appeals to UN member states in Geneva this morning to do their utmost to prevent an Israeli ground operation in Rafah. The president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Mirjana Spoljaric, said she was "out of words to describe the human suffering" and warned that should Rafah be attacked the "carnage so far will reach unimaginable depths. " She told UN member states they should not "offload your responsibilities as parties to the Geneva conventions onto humanitarian actors", adding that it did not make sense to criticise aid agencies for not doing more - "you have us to enable us to do more, our staff are already risking their lives. " Martin Griffiths, the UN’s emergency relief coordinator, described conditions in Gaza for effective aid delivery as "almost non-existent", and repeated the UN’s position that it would not participate in any forcible evacuation, which would be a violation of international law. And, in a warning to Israel, he added "if you launch a ground operation in Rafah, do not look to us as the rescue party". The head of the Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, Kate Forbes, who has just returned from Gaza, appeared close to tears as she described the situation as the worst she had seen in 43 years.
