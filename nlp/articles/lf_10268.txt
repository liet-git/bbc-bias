T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Tzipi Hotovely's comments offer a sharp rebuke to renewed talk of establishing an independent Palestine alongside Israel as a way to permanent peace. The so-called two-state solution has long been backed by the international community, though not Israel where support for the idea has receded over the past two decades as bloodshed escalated. Alluding to the stance of the current Israeli government, US President Joe Biden declared just two days ago: "You cannot say there’s no Palestinian state at all in the future. " It is also the policy of the UK government, as well as of other close allies of Israel. The comments by Israel’s ambassador to the UK make clear there are no meeting of minds on this at the current time nor seemingly, in the wake of the 7 October attack by Hamas, into the future. The blame for this she put squarely on the Palestinians, saying they did not want a state next to Israel, but in place of Israel. Hotovely represents the Israeli government in the UK, but opposition to a Palestinian state has long been her political position. Prior to her appointment as UK ambassador, she was minister for settlements in a previous right-wing Israeli government. Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. A two-state solution envisages their removal, completely or partially - something neither Hotovely nor the Israeli government are willing to accept. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
