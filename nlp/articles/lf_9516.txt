US National Security Council John Kirby has just been asked if there is a "red line" when it comes to the US providing military assistance to Israel in light of the attack on the aid workers. "We’ve had this discussion quite a bit," Kirby says to the reporter, before adding that: "They (Israel) are still under a viable threat from Hamas, we are still going to make sure they can defend themselves and that 7 October doesn’t happen again. " "That doesn’t mean it’s a free pass, that we look the other way when something like this happens. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
