Earlier today, the UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths gave a dire assessment on the humanitarian situation in Gaza, but said that there were discussions happening with Israel to open the Kerem Shalom crossing. The Kerem Shalom crossing is located southeast of Rafah, and is solely a commercial goods junction between Israel and southern Gaza. It was first closed by Israel along with the Erez crossing in north Gaza soon after Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October. Which means at the moment, the Rafah crossing with Egypt is the only way in and out of the Gaza Strip for both goods and people. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
