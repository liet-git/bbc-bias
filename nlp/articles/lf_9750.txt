This is the most strident tone the White House has taken so far on Israel. The statement put out after the call reflects the anger President Biden’s officials have described after the World Central Kitchen strike. Biden effectively demanded that Israel ensures the protection of civilians in Gaza and lets in food aid. And the text released after his call with Netanyahu contained a warning: that US policy with respect to Gaza would change if Israel doesn’t immediately act on those demands. That’s a significant shift - the US is saying there is a limit to the support it will give Israel given the catastrophic situation that’s unfolded on the ground in Gaza. Afterwards, a White House spokesman was asked repeatedly if that meant limiting arms supplies to Israel - he left his answer ambiguous, repeating only that US policy would change if the Israeli actions did not.
