An independent candidate who tapped into local residents' anger about the war in Gaza has beaten Labour in Blackburn. Solicitor Adnan Hussein snatched a stunning victory with 10,518 votes, just ahead of Labour's Kate Hollern's 10,386. Ms Hollern had entered the election campaign defending a healthy majority of 18,616 from the 2019 election. Mr Hussein had pledged to be "a voice for all" in the constituency in a video address when he announced his candidacy.  The Workers Party of Britain candidate John Murray came third with 7,105 votes. About a third of Blackburn's residents are Muslim and the previously-safe Labour seat was one of several the party felt were vulnerable due to outrage from many who felt it had not spoken out strongly enough against the ongoing conflict in Gaza. In his candidacy video, Mr Hussain had promised to make sure constituents' concerns about Gaza were "heard loud and clear in the places where our so-called representatives have failed". Ms Hollern's defeat was Labour's second loss to an independent, after Jonathan Ashworth lost Leicester South to Shockat Adam. Turnout in Blackburn dropped from 61.8% in 2019 to 53.1%.
