T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. If Iran attacks from its territory, "Israel will react and attack in Iran," Israel's Minister for Foreign Affairs Israel Katz says. In a statement posted on X this morning , in both Hebrew and Persian, he warned Israel would respond with force, tagging Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. This is the latest escalation in a series of threats exchanged between Israel and Iran. Khamenei said on Wednesday that Israel "must be punished and it shall be" after Iran's consulate was attacked in Syria on 1 April . Iran said an Israeli strike had killed seven military advisers .  "When they attack the consulate, it is as if they have attacked our soil," Khamenei said in a speech marking the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Israel has not said whether it was behind the attack. Iran supports groups that have waged war on Israel since it launched its military offensive in Gaza, following the 7 October Hamas attacks in southern Israel. Israeli foreign minister Israel Katz.
