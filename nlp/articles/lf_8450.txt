The Palestinian news agency Wafa says that 35 people have been killed in strikes on several houses in the Jabalia refugee camp in Gaza. Palestinian health officials in the territory have not been able to confirm the number of deaths but the Israeli military said on Saturday that it had bombed a building in Jabalia from the air. They said this comes after its forces came under fire and Hamas militants were seen on the roof. Wafa explained local sources reported that civil defense and ambulance crews recovered 24 dead bodies and at least 90 were wounded. Many civilians, according to Palestinian media, remain trapped under the rubble there. Wafa added that a further 11 people were killed and dozens injured in an Israeli strike that targeted a family house in Jabalia.
