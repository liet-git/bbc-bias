T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. As we've been reporting, fighting is continuing to rage in the southern city of Khan Younis, where many Palestinians sought shelter after evacuating the north of Gaza earlier in the conflict. In a post on X , the Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) says Israeli aircraft targeted a house near the organisation's headquarters and the Al-Amal Hospital in the city. It says the bombardment led to "the shattering of glass and the breaking of doors and windows, in addition to extreme panic among 14,000 displaced people who are taking shelter inside PRCS facilities. " The PRCS says the hospital received dozens of injured and some dead people as a result of the attack, without giving specific figures. The BBC is not yet able to independently verify the claims.
