The focus of our reporting this morning has largely been the United Nations draft resolution on humanitarian aid for Gaza - a vote for which is expected later today. While we wait to find out what time that may happen, let's remind ourselves of the basic facts. What is a United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolution? It is the formal expression of the will of the 15 members of the Security Council, the primary decision-making body at the UN. There are five permanent members (the US, Russia, China, France & the UK) which have a veto. The other ten members are elected for two-year terms. What is this resolution about specifically? The aim is to agree a text setting out when and how to bring more aid into Gaza, and when and how to create the conditions for ending or at least pausing the fighting. The disagreement has focused on Israel’s role in deciding what aid can get in, and whether to call for a ceasefire or cessation or suspension of hostilities. How does it work? The current chair of the Security Council – the United Arab Emirates – put forward a resolution. That has been much discussed and amended in recent days and several planned votes have been postponed. The aim has been to avoid yet another veto by the United States. This would allow the council to show unity. The trade-off is that the resolution may well be weaker as a result. What does a vote mean? Votes by the UN Security Council are legally binding. Under the UN Charter, all member states are obligated to carry out the decisions of the council. But a call for a ceasefire does not mean there will be one. Hamas is a non-state actor and is not a member of the UN. And Israel often ignores the organisation which it considers to be institutionally hostile. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
