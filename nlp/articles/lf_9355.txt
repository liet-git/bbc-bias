Another doctor, this time from northern Gaza, is now telling us about the situation there. In a voicenote, Dr Mohammed Salha explains how three departments at his hospital stopped running today because of electricity shortages: Today, we stopped the operating department and also the laboratory department and the X-Ray department because we can’t run the generator. We are providing emergency services only. Dr Mohammed has also sent over photos of staff inside the hospital cooking. Like others in Gaza we’ve been hearing from today, he says staff have been baking bread over fire. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
