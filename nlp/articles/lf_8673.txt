T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. The major explosion in Beirut on Tuesday night follows an escalation in fighting between Israeli forces and Hezbollah on the border of Israel and Lebanon since 7 October. Israeli soldiers and Hezbollah fighters have been killed in the cross-border exchanges, and Israel has evacuated thousands of civilians from the north, near its border with Lebanon. Late last month, Israelâ€™s former Minister of Defence Benny Gantz said Israeli forces would act to remove Hezbollah from the border if its attacks continued. Hezbollah is a designated terrorist organisation by Western states, Israel, Gulf Arab countries and the Arab League. Funded by Iran, it is one of the most heavily-armed, non-state military forces in the world. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
