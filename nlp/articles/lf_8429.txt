We heard earlier from Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran, whose family are among hundreds trapped in a Catholic Church in Gaza City, with Israeli forces operating outside. Moran has now announced on X that a tank has taken position outside the church and the building opposite has been taken by the Israeli military. In her social media post she said: "The people inside have died. There are snipers at every window pointing into the church. " She adds that soldiers are "still shooting anyone emerging from buildings to use eg toilets" and there is "still no food or water". Moran says that her family are "days away from dying" without access to water or food. They include her grandmother, her grandmother's son, his wife and their 11-year-old twins. They are Christian Palestinians who have been using the church as shelter after their home was bombed in October. Read more about Moran's family situation here . T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
