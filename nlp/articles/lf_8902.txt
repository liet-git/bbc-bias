Now the UN Security Council has approved the motion calling for more aid to get into Gaza, let's take a look at the situation with humanitarian relief on the ground. Aid agencies and charities are warning that the amount of vital supplies getting in to the Strip is too low, with around 1.9 million people in Gaza - 85% of the population - internally displaced by Israeli air strikes and ground fighting. The UN's World Food Programme has warned that Gaza is at risk of famine if the war continues, calling for an immediate ceasefire and a resumption of commercial food deliveries to address shortages. Israel has limited the amount and speed of aid and other supplies getting into Gaza since 7 October, saying it needs to check everything entering the territory. Ongoing fuel shortages have led to severe difficulties getting aid to people, while the destruction of infrastructure and ongoing battles in many areas have also caused significant problems with distributing what has got in. The UK-based charity Action Aid, which specialises in aid focused on women and girls, says Gaza's "spiralling food crisis" has left tens of thousands of pregnant women "desperately hungry, while mothers are so malnourished they are unable to breastfeed their newborn babies". Away from food insecurity, Medical charity Doctors without Borders (MSF), says treating war-wounded in Gaza is made much harder by Israel's "complete siege", as accessing enough drugs and medical equipment vital for life-saving surgery is impossible.
