T-I-T-L-E-E-N-D.  T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. There is a "gap" between Israel's intent to protect civilians and how the war has been unfolding in Gaza, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said. "It is imperative – it remains imperative – that Israel put a premium on civilian protection, and there does remain a gap between exactly what I said when I was there, the intent to protect civilians, and the actual results that we’re seeing on the ground," Blinken said, at a joint press conference with UK foreign secretary David Cameron in Washington DC on Thursday. Blinken has made four trips to the region since the war broke out on 7 October. The US has been talking with Israel about implementing "daily pauses" in fighting and letting the Gazans know where they can go to move out of harm's way. "Israel has an obligation to do everything possible to put a premium on protecting civilians and maximizing humanitarian assistance," he said. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
