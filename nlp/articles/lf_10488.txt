The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) says the suspension of funding is affecting their ability to operate in Gaza. Countries including the UK have paused funding for UNRWA after the agency announced the sacking of several of its staff over allegations they were involved in the 7 October Hamas attacks. "The decision which has been taken by 15 countries to temporarily pause and suspend the contribution to UNRWA amounts to $450m," Philippe Lazzarini said during a trip to Dublin earlier today. "If this is to be maintained, it will definitely impact our ability to continue to operate. " He was joined by deputy Irish premier Micheal Martin, who urged countries to reverse their suspension of funding and pledged €20 million (£17 million) in support for UNRWA. "Israel has launched a disinformation campaign against UNRWA. Sufficient aid is still not reaching civilians in Gaza and that is very unacceptable," he said. On Wednesday, Foreign Secretary David Cameron said the UK wants an "absolute guarantee" that UNRWA will not employ staff who may be willing to attack Israel. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
