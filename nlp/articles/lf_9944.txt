In the wake of Iran’s attack on Israel, some commentators reflected on how the Western world’s attention may be diverted away from the humanitarian situation in Gaza and on to concerns about a wider regional conflict. But what was interesting both from Lord Cameron’s media interviews this morning and the debate in the House of Commons was the determination from all political parties to keep a focus on Gaza. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak insisted the UK's efforts are focused on ensuring a pause in fighting and getting aid into Gaza. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: “While there is no justification for Iran’s actions, we cannot be naive to the fact that one of the drivers of tension in the region is the ongoing war in Gaza. ”. He repeated his call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. SNP deputy Westminster leader Mhairi Black condemned the actions of Iran as "a cynical attempt to exploit the suffering, the pain and the turmoil being experienced by those people in Palestine". She told the Commons: "The biggest continuing cause of conflict is the siege of Gaza, hence the need for a ceasefire. ”. While the UK’s main political parties have united in condemning Iran’s attack, it seems they are also keen to keep the pressure on Tel Aviv over the situation in Gaza. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
