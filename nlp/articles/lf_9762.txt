T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. We've been reporting on the UN-backed report which found famine is imminent and likely to occur in the next two months in the northern Gaza Strip. Martin Griffiths, the UN's head of humanitarian affairs and emergency relief says the international community should "hang its head in shame" for failing to prevent famine in Gaza. "More than one million people are at risk because they have been cut off from life-saving aid, markets have collapsed, and fields have been destroyed," he says in a social media post. He calls on Israeli authorities to allow complete and unfettered access for humanitarian goods - right now all aid is being checked over before being allowed in. We know that once famine is declared, it is way too late. We also know that, with action and goodwill, it can be averted. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
