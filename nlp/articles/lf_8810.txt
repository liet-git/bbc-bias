T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Let's bring you some more insight on what's happening on the ground in Gaza from a doctor working in the territory with medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (commonly known as Doctors Without Borders). Mohammad Abu Mughaiseb reflected on the start of Israel's ground operation in the south of the territory, and said the fighting was "more intense" a week after the seven-day ceasefire ended last Friday. "MSF activity stopped almost all (work in) Gaza," he told the BBC World Service's Newshour programme earlier. "In the south, we stopped because of the security. "Hospitals in the north and Gaza City stopped totally. What is still functioning is in the south - hospitals - but they are crowded (and used as) shelters as well. " Medics were operating on "patients lying on the ground", he added. "It's the catastrophe of the century. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
