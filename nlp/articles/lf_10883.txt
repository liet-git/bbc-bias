From the very start of this war, Israel’s staunchest allies offered powerful and very public backing as it launched retaliatory strikes, vowing to destroy Hamas. The 7 October attacks shattered Israel’s security and its sense of self. It says it’s a different country after the largest loss of Israeli lives in a single day, and the seizing of more than 250 hostages. But six months on even Israel’s best friends, including the US and the UK, are asking tough questions about the way Israel is fighting this war. Israel says it is doing everything it can to protect civilians, blaming Hamas for putting them in the line of fire by hiding inside densely-populated neighbourhoods. But women and children, aid workers and journalists, are being killed in staggering numbers, breaking all records of recent wars. There’s growing concern this grievous war will create new hatreds, and hostilities, in Gaza and far beyond. And there are louder calls for a ceasefire to ease suffering, bring hostages home, and search for solutions to resolve this intractable conflict. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
