T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Here's a bit more of what we're hearing from various officials and media outlets in Gaza itself. Ashraf al-Qudra, a spokesman for the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza, said more than 100 people were killed while waiting for aid to be delivered in northern Gaza - and more than 700 others wounded. He said the incident took place at the Nabulsi roundabout, on Rashid Street, on Thursday and blamed Israeli forces for what he described as a "massacre". He warned that dozens of casualties in a critical or severe condition had been brought to the nearby al-Shifa Hospital, in Gaza City, and that medics were unable to cope with the volume and severity of cases. Meanwhile, the official Palestinian news agency, Wafa, cited medical sources as saying that Israeli forces fired towards thousands of people from Gaza City, and other northern areas, as they waited at Nabulsi roundabout for the arrival of lorries loaded with humanitarian aid. As we've said already, details are still coming in and we'll continue to bring you the latest as we get it. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
