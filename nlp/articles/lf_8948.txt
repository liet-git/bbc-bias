Fighting in the Gaza Strip has continued with Israeli bombardments in the north and south of the territory - and Hamas firing rockets towards south and central Israel with sirens sounding in Tel Aviv yesterday. The UN's World Food Programme spokesperson Shaza Moghraby has reiterated the need for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire to avert what she said was the very serious threat of famine in Gaza. She said more than a quarter of households there currently faced extreme hunger.  Trucks bringing aid from Egypt have delivered some food, water and medicine, but the United Nations says the quantity of food is just 10% of what is needed for the territory's population. Hopes of a ceasefire suffered a setback when Hamas and other Palestinian groups announced they would not agree to a deal to release more hostages until Israel agrees to end the war. The Israeli government has repeatedly rejected a permanent ceasefire with Hamas. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
