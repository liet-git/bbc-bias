T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. The United Nations human rights chief has warned Israel not to launch a fully-fledged military operation in Rafah. Volker Türk said such an operation would be "terrifying, given the prospect that an extremely high number of civilians, again mostly children and women, will likely be killed and injured". He also said that a land incursion into Rafah could mean that the "meagre" humanitarian aid getting into Gaza might stop. An estimated 1.5 million people are crammed into the city, with thousands more thought to still be in northern Gaza. UN aid agencies have already said that many risk starvation because of the very limited aid supplies being allowed in. In a clear warning to Israel over its obligations under international law, Türk said fighting in Rafah risked "further atrocity crimes". He added: "Israel must comply with the legally binding orders issued by the International Court of Justice, and with the full span of international humanitarian law. "Those who defy international law have been put on notice. Accountability must follow. " Israel has repeatedly insisted that it is respecting international law in its operation in Gaza, but the International Court of Justice (ICJ) last month accepted South Africa’s initial claim that the conflict might have elements of genocide. It ordered Israel to prevent acts that might be considered genocide in Gaza, allow humanitarian aid in, punish incitement to genocide, and take measures to protect Palestinians. The UN special rapporteur on the occupied territories said, last week, she believed Israel was already in breach of the ICJ ruling. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
