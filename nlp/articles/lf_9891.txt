Unicef's Hamish Young, a senior emergency coordinator, has described the overnight bombardment in Rafah as "horrendous" and "relentless". He told the BBC, no one living in the border city had any sleep last night. He says 14 residential buildings were destroyed, but adds, "it's really important to get beyond those numbers". He says a Palestinian colleague "broke down weeping" on Monday morning, as he recalled the impact the air strikes had on him and his family, leaving his grandchildren screaming in fear. "Children should not have to go through this," says Young. The situation on the ground in Rafah "is already catastrophic", with "barely enough food for everyone to eat", he adds. Palestinian children stand among the rubble following an Israeli airstrike on the Rafah refugee camp. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
