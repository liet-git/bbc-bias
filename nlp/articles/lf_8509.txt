The United Nations General Assembly has voted on Friday in favour of a resolution granting Palestine enhanced status within the organisation. In a heated debate ahead of the vote, the Israeli ambassador called the vote a “travesty”, producing a mini-shredder into which he fed a pocket sized UN charter. The General Assembly vote - with 143 nations in favour - confers significant additional rights to Palestine, which currently holds what’s known as non-member observer status at the UN. For the first time, it can fully take part in debates, propose agenda items and have its representatives elected to committees, although it still won’t have voting rights – something only the UN Security Council has the power to confer.
