We reported a little earlier on information provided by the Israeli military that three of its soldiers were killed in a Hamas rocket attack near Kerem Shalom overnight, one of the main crossings used to deliver aid into Gaza. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) now says that a fourth solider was killed. Hamas's armed wing claimed responsibility and said its target was a nearby Israeli army base. Talks aimed at securing a ceasefire deal in Gaza and the release of hostages have stalled following the rocket strike. Subsequent Israeli strikes in the southern Gazan city of Rafah killed at least 19 Palestinians overnight. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
