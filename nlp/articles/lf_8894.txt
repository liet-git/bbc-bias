T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Here's a quick recap of today’s UN's Security Council meeting in New York. The Council approved a resolution demanding large scale aid deliveries to Gaza to resume after days of negotiations to avoid another US veto - yet it stops short of calling for an immediate truce. Instead, it urges the creation of conditions for a sustainable cessation of hostilities. Thirteen council members voted in favour; the United States and Russia abstained - albeit for different reasons. The UAE - which sponsored the resolution - acknowledged it wasn't perfect but said it was vital to avert famine in Gaza – something aid agencies have warned of. Reaction has been coming in from all sides involved in the conflict - and the resolution seems to have pleased nobody fully. Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian ambassador, said the resolution was a step in the right direction but reiterated calls for an immediate ceasefire. Hamas called the resolution an "insufficient step" for meeting the needs of Gaza and said the US had "worked hard to empty this resolution of its essence". Israel's ambassador to the UN criticised the Security Council resolution, saying its focus on aid is "unnecessary and disconnected from reality. And UN secretary general Antonio Guterres said the way Israel was conducting its military offensive was the main obstacle to aid distribution inside Gaza. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
