US President Joe Biden will speak with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today, the BBC's US broadcast partner CBS News has confirmed. It will be the first call between the pair since 15 February. There's been growing criticism from the US, Israel's top ally, about civilian casualties from its war in Gaza. US Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer called on Israel to hold a new election, and said Netanyahu had "lost his way", in a recent speech praised by President Biden . It will also be the first call since Biden's State of the Union address, when he was heard on a hot mic telling members of Congress that he'd told Netanyahu "you and I are going to have a 'come-to-Jesus' meeting".
