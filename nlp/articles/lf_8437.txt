Crowds have been boarding and chasing aid trucks as they enter Gaza today as the ongoing war creates an increasingly desperate situation for trapped civilians. On Thursday, the UN's Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA) warned that it was becoming difficult to deliver aid as hungry crowds would stop the trucks and grab something to eat. Philippe Lazzarini, who heads up UNRWA, told reporters just a few days ago; "People are stopping aid in trucks, taking the food and eating it right away. And this is how desperate and hungry they are. " Lazzarini added that his teams on the ground were meeting more and more people who hadn't eaten for days. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
