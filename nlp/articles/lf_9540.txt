We're now hearing reports that ships carrying some 240 tonnes of aid to Gaza are set to turn around without completing their delivery, Cyprus's foreign ministry has said. The announcement comes after the aid group World Central Kitchen (WCF) suspended their operations in the Palestinian enclave after an Israeli strike killed seven of its workers. As we reported earlier , WCK, which has been on the ground for months and which had just brought in a second 400 tonne shipment of aid by sea from Cyprus, is playing an increasingly prominent and important role in preventing Gaza from sliding into famine.
