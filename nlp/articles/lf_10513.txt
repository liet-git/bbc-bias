Senior Republican lawmakers in the US say withholding US weapons shipments to Israel increases the danger to civilians in Rafah, and will encourage an Israeli operation in the city. At an ongoing news conference on Capitol Hill, South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham - a vocal critic of Joe Biden - says he is "pleading" with the president to "change course". "What I fear is that that this decision to withhold weapons has made the likelihood of going into Rafah greater, not less," he says. "It's going to make it longer, not shorter. " Additionally, Graham argues that withholding weapons to Israel will send a message to other US partners  - particularly Saudi Arabia - that Washington is an unreliable ally. "The consequences of this decision, Mr President, are going to change the region and the world for all the worst," Graham adds. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
