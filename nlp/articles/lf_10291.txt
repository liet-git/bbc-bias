Cogat, the Israeli military agency tasked with coordinating aid access in Gaza, says 60 aid trucks have passed through the Erez crossing in the north of Gaza so far today. Earlier today, international aid agencies said the closing of the two main crossings into southern Gaza - Rafah and Kerem Shalom - was making it virtually impossible to assist civilians inside the enclave. The UN has called for both crossings to be reopened immediately . It says Israel is not allowing humanitarian workers access to the Rafah crossing, after taking control of the Gaza side of the border with Egypt. The other main crossing, Kerem Shalom, was closed after a rocket attack by Hamas fighters over the weekend killed four Israeli soldiers in the area. Hamas then targeted the crossing in another attack this morning. An Israeli soldier stands guard as a truck carrying aid makes its way through the Erez crossing to Gaza at the weekend. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
