T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. A senior member of Israel’s governing coalition has strongly criticised its military's decision to sack two senior officers over the strike that killed seven aid workers. National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir has called the chief of staff's decision to remove the two senior officers something that "amounts to the abandonment of troops in the middle of a war". Ben Gvir, an ultra-nationalist politician who is known for making anti-Arab comments and has a past conviction for racism, says the decision to remove the officers is a “grave mistake that conveys weakness". Even if mistakes were made, soldiers should be supported in war, he writes in a post shared on the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter.
