Heavy rain blanketed Gaza for much of the first morning of Eid, further underscoring the bleakness of the usually joyful occasion this year. But the voices of children singing in Gaza City somewhat lightened the mood, if only for a moment. There's little hope on the horizon for Gazans - some of whom have been returning to the ruins of their homes after the bulk of Israeli forces withdrew. The latest round of ceasefire talks is faltering on, with both Hamas and the Israeli government yet to deliver their final verdict. Israeli officials say the government has made a significant concession in agreeing to allow150,000 displaced Palestinians to return to northern Gaza. Meanwhile, Iran and Israel have been trading further threats, with the Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant saying that "decisive offensive action" would be taken against the territory of whoever attacks Israel.
