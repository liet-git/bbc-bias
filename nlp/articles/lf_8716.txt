T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. We've been hearing more testimonies from people in Gaza. Feda'a Murjan is living in Rafah, and while she tries to celebrate Eid, her thoughts are preoccupied with memories of Habiba, her eight-year-old daughter who was killed on 13 October. "As you know we all used to gather, wear the best clothes we had, [eat] the best chocolate and celebrate days of happiness and joy - but unfortunately this Eid is very different from any Eid before," Feda'a tells BBC News. "I'm a defeated, sad mother. No words can describe the terrible, horrible combination of very bad feelings". Feda'a says Habiba died after an airstrike hit her neighbour's house, "without any warning before", partly reducing her own home to rubble. "She was drawing a picture at the table," Feda'a says. She adds that people in Rafah are suffering from a lack of food, water and medical treatment, and have nowhere else to go. "It's not safe at all - they are bombing here, they are destroying the homes over the heads of the people here. There is no safe space in this little spot of the world". T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
