Sam Rose, the director of planning at UNRWA (the UN agency for Palestinian Refugees) has been telling the BBC about the "desperate" humanitarian situation in Rafah, southern Gaza. Israel has been directing people in eastern Rafah to expanded "humanitarian areas", but Rose says there's "nowhere" safe for those people to go. The "safe zone" can't fit any more people, he says, adding that one half of the zone is made of sand dunes that "can't accommodate people for any length of time". He says the other half of the safe zone is inside Khan Younis, which he says has experienced "savage bombardment" over the past few weeks. He says borders and crossing points need to reopen for commodities and food to allow humanitarian agencies to provide support. Sam Rose spoke to the BBC News Channel from inside Rafah. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
