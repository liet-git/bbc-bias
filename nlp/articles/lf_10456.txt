T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Stepping away from what's happened in northern Gaza briefly, medics in the occupied West Bank say two Israelis have been killed in a gun attack. Security forces at the scene are reported to have shot dead at least one gunman - in a post on X the Israeli military describes him as a "terrorist". The IDF adds: "Forces are blocking roads and conducting a chase for additional suspects in the area. " A spokesperson for Magen Dovid Adom (MDA), Israel's medical emergency service, says a report was received at 17:08 local time (15:08 GMT) on Thursday of gunshot wounds at a petrol station near the Eli settlement. "MDA medics and paramedics provided medical treatment on the spot to two injured people who were in critical condition," one update from the service said, followed by another that confirmed the deaths of "two men" - one in his 40s and the other in the 20s. There has been a surge in violence in the West Bank since the war began in October. Last week, three Palestinian men killed one Israeli and wounded several others near the Jewish settlement of Maale Adumim. MDA posted this image on its Telegram, along with the two updates.
