Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh has been speaking at a conference of Muslim scholars in Qatar - where he is based - telling an audience that Israel has “failed to achieve any of its goals” in the war in Gaza. Haniyeh argues that the Hamas attacks of 7 October "came after an attempt to marginalise the Palestinian cause" and - referencing the hostages held in Gaza - says that Israel "will never recover their prisoners unless they release all of our prisoners". In further comments later released by Hamas, Haniyeh called on Muslim states "to support the resistance with weapons, because this is. . . not the battle of the Palestinian people alone".
