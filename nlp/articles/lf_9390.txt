As we approach five months of fighting in the Israel-Gaza war, let's take a look at some of the most recent developments: At least 29,700 Palestinians have been killed since the war began, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Israel’s war cabinet has warned that unless Hamas frees all hostages held in Gaza by 10 March an offensive will be launched in Rafah. Ramadan - the Islamic holy month of fasting - begins on 10 March this year and Rafah is where 1.5 million Palestinians are currently sheltering. There has been growing global opposition to the Israeli forces expanding their offensive into Rafah with 13 out of 15 countries voting at the UN for a draft proposal that called for an immediate ceasefire. The US vetoed the resolution and the UK abstained. Over the weekend, there were renewed talks of a ceasefire deal with negotiations thought to be taking place in Paris. It was reported that Israel are also sending a delegation to Qatar to continue talks, with Egyptian state media saying Hamas representatives will be present. US President Joe Biden has said he hopes to have a ceasefire "by next Monday" T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
