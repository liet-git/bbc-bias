T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Mark Regev - a senior adviser to the Israeli prime minister - has rejected comments made by US President Joe Biden that Israel is "indiscriminately bombing" parts of Gaza. On Tuesday, Biden told a closed-door fundraising event that Israel was losing international support as a result. Speaking to the BBC, Regev says the assertion is "not true". He adds that, at a meeting earlier today, the Israeli military showed the US its "rigorous process" of selecting targets. Asked whether concerns Israel's allies have raised about civilian deaths in Gaza have affected the country's decision-making, he says "of course". "We can disagree on tactics but we share the same goal," he says, adding that Israel has done its "utmost" to protect civilians and facilitate access for humanitarian aid. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
