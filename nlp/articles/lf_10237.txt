The US government wants the war between Israel and Hamas to end "as soon as possible", a national security spokesman for the White House has said. John Kirby was speaking to reporters in Washington DC about today's visit to Tel Aviv by US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. He said Sullivan discussed Israel moving to "low-intensity operations" in Gaza "in the near future" in the talks. "But I don't want to put a timestamp on it,‚Äù Kirby added. He also said the US was not "dictating terms to the Israelis of how long it has to take". "[The war] has to take as long as they feel they need to take to be able to eliminate this threat, but obviously we all want it to be over as soon as possible," he said. Israel's defence minister told Sullivan the conflict would last "several months" more - though CBS News has cited two US officials as saying Israel has told the White House that the current phase of the offensive should be over in two to three weeks.
