T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Conservative Miriam Cates says "war is terrible", and this one is "devastating" and "appalling", but it was "unavoidable" because of Hamas's massacre on 7 October. Any government that did not act to prevent the 7 October attacks happening again would be failing in its duty to protect its citizens, she says, adding "we are all appalled by the loss of life", but to call for an unconditional ceasefire is "naive". Cates argues there is no moral equivalence between "murderous terrorists and rapists" attacking civilians "with glee" and a nation state using conventional forces to "root out dangerous enemies". Hamas bears responsibility for all the deaths in the conflict and must be destroyed, she adds. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
