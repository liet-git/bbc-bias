Israeli leaders say the battle for the southern Gaza Strip is well under way. In a news conference last night, the Defence Minister, Yoav Gallant, said what had already happened to Gaza City was now happening in Khan Younis. With US officials starting to voice disquiet about Israel’s tactics, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had words for those he said were trying to pressure Israel: the only way to finish the job quickly was to use crushing force against Hamas. That approach is once again killing large numbers of civilians and sending others fleeing for safety. In a meeting earlier with recently released hostages and the families of those still being held by Hamas, the prime minister found himself under attack. In a leaked recording of the meeting, one former hostage, who hasn’t been identified, accused Netanyahu of putting politics above the safe return of the remaining 138 hostages. Her outburst was greeted with applause. An Israeli jeep close to the Gaza boundary on Tuesday during an air strike. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
