Israel's war cabinet has been meeting to weigh up the country's response to Iran's drone and missile attack on Israel over the weekend. Tehran's action, in retaliation to Israel's strike on its consulate in Syria, has been strongly condemned by Israel's allies worldwide. Let's take a look at some of today's main developments, as Israel considers how it will react to Iran: Addressing Parliament this afternoon, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak called on "all sides" to "show restraint" after Iran's attack on Israel on Saturday. The PM said he would speak to his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu to express solidarity and discuss how to prevent "further escalation" Sunak told MPs Iran had sought to "plunge the Middle East into crisis" , adding that Tehran's attack on Israel was "a reckless and dangerous escalation" His remarks echo the overwhelming reaction from Israel's foreign partners, who say any escalation to the ongoing conflict in the region should be avoided. Belgium, France and Germany are among several countries who have summoned Iranian ambassadors , adding to the mounting international pressure on Tehran. Tensions between Israel and Iran have been high for some time, with the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen firing drones and missiles towards Israel in response to the war in Gaza, and the Iran-backed Hezbollah group in Lebanon firing rockets towards Israel from the north.
