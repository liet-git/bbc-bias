T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. As we mentioned earlier, White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan is on his way to Israel, where he's due to hold talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and members of the Israeli war cabinet. The talks follow warnings from Israel's closest ally, the US, about how it is conducting the war with Hamas. US President Joe Biden blamed Israel’s “indiscriminate bombing” of Gaza for a loss of global support for its war on Hamas. It's thought those sentiments will lead to discussion over a need for more surgical and precise strikes against targets in Gaza. On Wednesday, Sullivan held talks with the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. US negotiations aimed normalising relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia were halted by the 7 October attacks, but it's reported all sides want to resurrect the deal in the future. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
