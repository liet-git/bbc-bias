Brazilian UN ambassador Sérgio França Danese has "welcomed" the new resolution, which he said comes at a time in which "this terrible crisis tests our humanity". Additionally, Danese said that "the time for a humanitarian response" to the war "is now, not tomorrow, and not when this conflict finally ends".
