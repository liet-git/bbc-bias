Israel’s war cabinet met for the second time in 24 hours amid growing rumours that some kind of retaliatory action was imminent. But it was also reported the cabinet was divided about how and when. Local media said the government wanted to hurt Iran for the attack without causing all-out war. They said ministers also wanted to act in co-ordination with the US. American officials have already made clear the US would not take part in any military action against Iran. Even though only two days have passed since the unprecedented Iranian attack, there was still space for political disagreement. Israel’s opposition leader, Yair Lapid, accused Netanyahu of presiding over a “total loss of Israeli deterrence”. Netanyahu later summoned some opposition leaders for a security briefing but Lapid was not included. Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman, Nasser Kanani, sought to justify his country’s attack on Israel. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
