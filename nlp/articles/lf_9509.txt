UK Prime Minister Sunak has told Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu that "he was appalled by the killing of aid workers, including three British nationals, in an airstrike in Gaza yesterday", a Downing Street spokesperson says. Sunak "demanded a thorough and transparent, independent investigation" into the incident, the spokesperson adds. “The Prime Minister said far too many aid workers and ordinary civilians have lost their lives in Gaza and the situation is increasingly intolerable. The UK expects to see immediate action by Israel to end restrictions on humanitarian aid, deconflict with the UN and aid agencies, protect civilians and repair vital infrastructure like hospitals and water networks. " Sunak added that Israel’s aim of defeating Hamas would not be achieved by allowing a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. Sunak visiting Netanyahu in Jerusalem last year after 7 October attacks.
