T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. A bit more from the IDF briefing earlier. The briefing was played footage taken from an IDF aircraft of what Hagari said was the strike itself, which showed two figures moving around outside a warehouse-like structure. He said Hamas had previously launched rockets from that location and an intercepted phone call was played purporting to be from a Gazan in the aftermath of the blast discussing the presence of Hamas weapons. The BBC has not verified this audio. Hagari says the IDF investigation is ongoing and, while it's "too early to determine" the cause of the fire, any outcome "won't make this situation any less tragic". T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
