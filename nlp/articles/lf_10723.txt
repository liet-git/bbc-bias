Thank you for following our coverage of the ICJ ruling in the Hague and the reaction following it. There's plenty more for you to read though: To read more about the ICJ's ruling that says Israel must prevent genocide in Gaza, click here. For more information on South Africaâ€™s genocide case against Israel at the ICJ, look here. And click here to read more about why Israel and Hamas fighting in Gaza. Correction 13 February: This page wrongly reported that about 1,300 people had been killed following the 7 October attack by Hamas. This was based on counting those who later died from their injuries in addition to the figure of more than 1,200. The article has been amended to now refer to about 1,200 deaths, a figure which includes those deaths and which Israel says is not final. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
