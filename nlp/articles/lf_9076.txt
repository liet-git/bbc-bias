South Africa's Jewish Board of Deputies has criticised the country's government for bringing the case against Israel at the ICJ, accusing it of "using a legal processes for something that requires political solutions". "This is especially when the ICJ has no jurisdiction over the brutal terror organisation Hamas," it said. Bringing the ICJ case had failed to save lives, the SAJBD said.
