T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Conservative MP Vicky Ford is now bringing up how some MPs say they're being harassed, stalked and threatened. One of the reasons, the Tory MP says, is the lack of transparency over the reasons why MPs vote one way or another. She says that this means it can be misinterpreted and then "used to drum up hatred of MPs". Ford suggests that MPs should be able to explain why they have voted a certain way and that should be written up online. "This would keep MPs safer. " Ford asks if the leader of the House will take the idea on board, adding that: "It would help keep our democracy safe. " Penny Mordaunt replies by saying that it is a very helpful suggestion and adds that "this House will never kowtow to extremists or intimidation. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
