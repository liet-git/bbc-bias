T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. No trucks have entered Gaza via the Erez crossing despite the recent announcement by Israel that it would be reopened, a charity says. "If the Erez crossing opens it would be step in the right direction, as it would make it possible for aid to come straight into the north," says Karyn Beattie, team leader for Save the Children's response in Gaza, but adds that so far "not a single aid truck" has come through. Israel has said that the crossing, which has been closed since 7 October, would reopen following the deaths of seven aid workers in an air strike on 1 April . The crossing's reopening would bring more aid into the north, where starvation is most acute. Aid agencies and foreign officials have long urged Israel to open more crossings.
