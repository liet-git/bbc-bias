Yael Noy doesn't wear military fatigues, but she describes herself as being in battle right now. "I'm fighting to stay moral when both sides are in such terrible pain. I'm fighting to be the same person I was before," says Yael, who heads a charity called Road to Recovery. The group of Israeli volunteers drive sick Palestinians - mostly children - from checkpoints in the occupied West Bank and Gaza to hospital appointments in Israel. They can no longer take patients from Gaza due to the ongoing war. Yael says she was so shaken after Hamas's assault on 7 October that she could barely breathe. Her parents are from one of the southern kibbutz communities which was attacked - they cowered, hour after terrifying hour. They are now displaced. "Something was broken in my heart and I said that I would never talk to people in Gaza again," she tells me. But after a few days, she decided that she couldn't allow the atrocities to change her. Yael and most of the Road to Recovery volunteers have continued to drive Palestinians from the West Bank to hospitals in Israel their appointments. As soon as she can, she says she'll go and help patients from Gaza again. Read Yael's story here .
