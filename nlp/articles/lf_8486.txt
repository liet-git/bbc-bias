A flying object, suspected to be a drone, has been shot down by Egypt's air defence, near the Red Sea coastal town of Dahab. Witnesses in the resort, which is located on the eastern Sinai coast, said that they saw an object fall into the water and another come down in a nearby mountainous area. In recent months, two Red Sea towns were subject to explosions caused by drones which Israel said were sent by Houthi rebels in Yemen, who declared their support for what they called "their brothers in Gaza" and have fired missiles and drones towards targets in Israel since the war began in October.
