T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. We've just heard from Palestinian Ambassador to the UN Riyadh Mansour, who spoke to reporters on his way in to the council chamber. He said the correct thing for the council is to adopt this resolution and to not let the UN secretary general down. Then France's ambassador to the UN, Nicolas de Rivi√®re, spoke and said diplomats need more time to negotiate because the last thing the Security Council needs today is another showdown and another failure. He said they can't rush and "drive the Security Council car against the wall",  adding that the previous resolution was modest and not enough. He said the situation is tragic, deteriorating by the day with civilian causalities increasing by the day, so they can't wait forever. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
