A Grade II-listed council building has been daubed with red paint for the third time in just over a month. Somerset County Hall was splashed with red paint overnight on Wednesday following recent protests from a group called Palestine Action. It is thought the protest is related to Somerset Council's ownership of a building let to defence contractor Elbit Systems UK, which activists claim has links to the Israeli military - something the company denies. A spokesperson for the council said it was "very disappointed" and "strongly condemns" the method of protest. "We are very disappointed at this further criminal damage of public property which will inevitably result in additional cost to the public purse," they said. “We believe this incident relates to a legacy commercial investment. "We have done what we can to engage protestors over their concerns and this investment property is in our commercial disposals programme, though as with every lease there are contractual obligations regarding the lease. “Today’s events again demonstrate the protestors’ preference to cause damage rather than engage in meaningful conversation. "While we respect the right of individuals and groups to protest, we strongly condemn this style of protest damaging a Grade II-listed public building. " Arrests were made earlier this month after red paint was sprayed onto the council's headquarters, with the four people released on bail after. The entrance to the building was also blocked. As part of its annual budget, Somerset Council previously agreed to sell an office at Aztec West to Elbit Systems UK. Elbit has maintained it does not supply equipment to the Israeli military.
