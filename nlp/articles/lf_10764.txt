As we've been reporting, the court will consider nine emergency measures proposed by South Africa, but not its allegation of genocide - which Israel strongly denies. Among those measures will be Israel suspending military operations immediately in Gaza. It may be a while until we get a ruling on that and the other eight measures, but stay with us for updates, reaction and analysis. You can also watch by clicking the Play button above. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
