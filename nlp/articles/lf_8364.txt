Let's take a quick look now at the situation around Israel's northern border with Lebanon. Israel's Air Force says fighter jets have attacked an "operational headquarters" of the Islamist Hezbollah group in Lebanon. The Israeli military also said it had hit "terrorist infrastructures" including "launching positions" and a "weapons warehouse". Earlier today Hezbollah said it had launched rocket attacks at Israeli military sites, including near the northern town of Metula, and announced the deaths of six of its fighters over a 24-hour period. Lebanese media reported that two civilians were killed today - one was shot by an Israeli sniper, another died following an Israeli air strike on the village of Markaba, the French-language newspaper Lâ€™Orient-Le Jour reported. The BBC is not able to verify details of any of these reports. Hezbollah is an ally of Hamas and controls the most powerful armed force in Lebanon. It has been trading fire with Israel in the border area since 7 October. Smoke was seen billowing over the border area following Israeli bombardment today. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
