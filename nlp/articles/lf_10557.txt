T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Let’s now bring you comments from Rafah itself, where we’ve just heard from Scott Anderson, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees' senior deputy director of affairs in Gaza. He tells us that the situation has been “growing more tense overnight”. This week, Israel issued evacuation orders in eastern parts of Rafah. Anderson says overnight there was some fighting moving westward -“toward the centre of Rafah itself” - and some 80,000 people are now displaced further. “Perhaps most worryingly, because Kerem Shalom and Rafah entry points [into Gaza] are closed… we’re beginning to run out of fuel,” Anderson tells the Today programme on Radio 4. Anderson adds that though the Erez crossing in the north is still open, that does little for the bulk of the population — 1.9 million people — who are in the southern part of the Strip. “We desperately need crossings to reopen so aid can continue to come in, as we will soon see the UN and our humanitarian partners begin to run out of food as early as tomorrow,” Anderson says.
