As we've been reporting, talks are being held in Cairo, Egypt, in an attempt to broker a new truce and the further release of Israeli hostages. Of the 240 or so hostages taken to Gaza during Hamas's 7 October attacks, about 120 of them are believed to still be in captivity. During a six-day ceasefire at the end of November, 105 hostages were released in exchange for Palestinians held in Israeli jails. Families of the remaining hostages are urging the Israeli government to reach a new truce so at least some of the captives can be freed. Negotiations are resuming in Cairo today after initial talks on Wednesday bore no fruit. Hamas's leader reportedly told Egyptian mediators that no more Israeli hostages will be released until there's a permanent ceasefire. Israel has repeatedly rejected a permanent ceasefire, insisting it will not stop the war until Hamas is dismantled. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
