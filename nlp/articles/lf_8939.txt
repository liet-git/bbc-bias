T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Let's bring you some thoughts from a former US ambassador who has explained more about the United States' stance at the UN security council. Gina Abercrombie-Winstanley , who is also the President of the Middle East Policy Council, has welcomed last night's signals from the US that Washington will move to support the new resolution on humanitarian aid for Gaza - but she explained some of the issues around the language being agreed upon. Speaking to BBC News, Abercrombie-Winstanley said: "The US is very close to Israel and the concern to Israel will definitely be taken into account. "The government of Israel and the United Nations have had a tenuous relationship over the years. "There was expressed distrust by the Israeli government about how goods going into the Gaza Strip were going to be screened and they should be able to have some sort of role in that. "That would have had to be worked out with very specific language. " The UN is expected to vote on the latest draft resolution later on Friday. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
