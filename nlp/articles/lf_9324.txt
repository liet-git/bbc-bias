According to some US media reports, White House officials have suggested Israel could finish its large-scale military operations in southern Gaza by January and then move to more targeted attacks on Hamas.

But a senior official quoted in the report says they aren’t comfortable using the word “receptive” to describe Israel’s response to US advice. “We are in a high-intensity operation in the coming weeks, then probably moving to a low-intensity mode,” an Israeli official told CNN.
