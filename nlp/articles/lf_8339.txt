Footage of a series of explosions in the southern city of Rafah has emerged in the last 24 hours. One video - which we’ve geolocated to the grounds of the Kuwaiti hospital - shows smoke rising from at least two locations. Separate footage, filmed from a roof, shows a collapsed building around 250m (273yds) from the hospital, and less than half a kilometre (550yds) from the Egyptian border. The World Health Organization has said that nearly three-quarters of Gaza’s hospitals are now out of action due to the depletion of supplies and Israeli raids – a situation it describes as “unconscionable”. The local Hamas-run authorities claimed that a series of air-strikes had taken place in the city, leaving 12 people dead and “dozens” wounded. The Israeli army says it has carried out strikes against more than 300 targets around Gaza in the past 24 hours. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
