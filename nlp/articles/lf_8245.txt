Next up is Virginia Crosbie , Tory MP for Ynys Môn, who asks the PM about farming. "Our farmers and food security are vital," she says, adding that the budget for farming should be "ring-fenced". Crosbie hits out at the Welsh government's plans for the industry, which she claims would result in job losses and a £2bn hit to the Welsh economy. Sunak says his government's plans are aimed at supporting farmers and growing more British food, in contrast to the plans of the Welsh government which he says will "decimate farming communities".
