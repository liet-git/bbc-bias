T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. There's been speculation about the authenticity of footage filmed by Israeli troops in northern Gaza, after two separate clips emerged in which the same man is seen surrendering a gun - but in each video, he holds it in a different hand. We earlier reported suggestions that separate "takes" of the same incident had been produced. But analysis by BBC Verify - of both videos and additional still images of the same scene - suggests these are sequential events, not separate takes, and the same man is going to and fro bringing different guns to the pavement with their detached magazines (ammunition). One video - which we know was shot first because of the position of the sun - shows the man placing a gun from his right hand on top of another on the pavement. In the next video, with the sun lower, the man places a different gun on top of those from his left hand. Still images corroborate and bookend this sequence, with one showing the very first gun being placed, and another showing the resulting three guns and magazines on the pavement. There are still some questions raised by the footage - notably, the man is at gunpoint following directions, and we can't know whether he was surrendering the weapons or simply following instructions to move them. The Israeli military did not directly respond when we asked it. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
