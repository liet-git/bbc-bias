T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. SNP MP Alan Brown says that the displacement of two million citizens by instruction of an occupying power breaches international law by violating article 49 of the Geneva Convention. "So where is the government's or Labour's condemnation of the displacement of civilians," Brown asks. He then adds that the Hamas attacks were brutal but says that the number of civilian deaths in Gaza are not justified. Brown continues to say that unless there's a ceasefire, "hostages are also at risk of death from disease, from starvation or even [being] killed by [the] IDF". "So perhaps it's time to listen to the brave families of hostages who have actually been protesting against Netanyahu and calling for a different approach. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
