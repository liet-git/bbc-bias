Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of the fallout from the vote in the Commons over calls to end the fighting Gaza. The day was supposed to be spent debating an SNP motion calling for a ceasefire, but in a break with convention, Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle chose the Labour Party's amendment in addition to the government's amendment to the original motion. The debate fast descended in chaos, with the Speaker accused of allowing it to be “hijacked” by Labour and some MPs walking out of the Commons. Hoyle later apologised, but still faces calls to resign. Now, some 33 Tory and SNP members have signed a motion declaring they have no confidence in the Speaker. Stick with us on this page for all the latest developments, reaction and analysis to this extraordinary political moment. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
