David Lammy, the UK's shadow foreign secretary, says the government should suspend offensive arms sales to Israel if there's a "clear risk" it has contravened international law. Lammy repeats his call for the government to publish internal legal advice on whether Israel is in breach of international law. Speaking about the seven aid workers killed in Gaza on Monday, Lammy says: "Israel must face serious consequences, not just tough rhetoric, for their appalling deaths. " The Labour mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, tells BBC Radio London that "we need to know" what the government's legal advice is and "if it says what people suspect it says, then the government should be halting sales". Rishi Sunak has said the UK has a "very careful export licensing regime" for arms sales. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
