T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Hundreds of Gaza's water and sanitation facilities have been damaged or destroyed since Israel began military action against Hamas, satellite analysis by BBC Verify has found. Clean water has always been a limited resource in Gaza and the territory has largely relied on a system of boreholes and desalination plants for its supply. Our analysis found that more than half of these vital facilities have been damaged or destroyed since 7 October. We also found that four of the six wastewater treatment plants - crucial to preventing the build-up of sewage and the spread of disease - have been damaged or destroyed. The two others have shut down because lack of fuel or other supplies, according to one aid agency. The plants were among more than 600 water and sanitation facilities that we analysed, using a list of locations provided by Gaza's Coastal Municipalities Water Utility (CMWU).
