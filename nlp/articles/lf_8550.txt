Our last couple of posts have looked at the aid situation in parts of Gaza - particularly the north - following an Israeli strike on Monday that killed seven humanitarian workers. Meanwhile, the NGO Oxfam has been looking at the realities of what Palestinians in the north of the Strip are facing on a daily basis - including that people have been forced to survive on an average of 245 calories a day (less than a can of fava beans) since January. It adds that "the minuscule amount of food represents less than 12% of the recommended daily 2,100-calorie intake needed per person, calculated using demographic data considering variations by age and gender". Oxfam quotes one mother in the region as saying: Before the war, we were in good health and had strong bodies. Now, looking at my children and myself, we have lost so much weight since we do not eat any proper food, we are trying to eat whatever we find - edible wild plants or herbs daily just to survive. ‚Äù. Israel has previously rejected a global assessment , warning of imminent famine in Gaza, and a UN court order calling for Israel to enable an immediate "unhindered" flow of aid - saying allegations that it's blocking supplies are "wholly unfounded".
