Hamas's armed wing says it's still inflicting blows on Israel - and "what is coming is greater". In an audio message given to Al Jazeera, spokesperson Abu Ubaida said the Israeli military "failed in the north and south of the Gaza Strip" and that it would fail more as it moved into other areas. Ubaida went on to say a previous week-long ceasefire between the two sides "proved our credibility", as the Israeli hostages freed during that period were only released on Hamas's terms. He added that no more hostages would be freed unless Israel engaged in talks. The message also said Hamas fighters had fully or partially destroyed 180 military vehicles and killed "a large number" of Israeli soldiers. The Israeli military has not commented, and the BBC cannot independently verify Hamas's claims. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
