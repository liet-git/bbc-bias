T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. The Israeli military says it has withdrawn all ground troops on active manoeuvres from southern Gaza. An Israeli army spokesman says that only one brigade is remaining for now, after a major operation in the southern city of Khan Younis was completed. That battle saw widespread destruction, with Palestinians displaced on a major scale, while large numbers of civilians were also killed in the fighting. A possible Israeli incursion into the southernmost town of Rafah has been looming for weeks. More than a million Palestinians have taken refuge there. It is unclear for now if this move by the Israeli military gives any fresh indication of what might happen there. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
