Earlier we heard from medical student Nagham Atef Mezied, 22, in Deir al Balah, who shared how her morning went with us . She's now got back in touch with an update from Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital: "Once, Tuesdays meant university lectures or rigorous clinical training at the hospital. I’d immerse myself in paediatric cases at Al-Nasr and Al-Rantisi Children’s Hospitals, honing my skills with dedication. "But today, on the 140th day of war, I find myself at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al Balah, a volunteer physician treating the casualties of war. "The once bustling halls of Al-Nasr and Al-Rantisi are now in ruins, yet amidst the devastation, I’ve grown significantly!" T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
