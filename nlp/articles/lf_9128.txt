Hello, you join us as we restart our live coverage of the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza - and how it's affecting the wider Middle East region. To get things going, here's a quick rundown of where things stand. Israel-Lebanon border. Cross-border fire continues between Israel and Hezbollah, two days after Hamas's deputy leader Saleh al-Arouri was assassinated in Beirut. Lebanese state-run National News Agency reported last night that Israel had "escalated its attacks" in southern Lebanon, with a blast at a three-storey house in the village of Naqoura, "destroying it completely". Hezbollah later confirmed that four of its members had been killed. Israel's military said it attacked "terrorist" infrastructure. Gaza. The Palestinian Red Crescent Society says its headquarters in Khan Younis, southern Gaza, is being targeted by Israel again - and that one person has been killed and several others injured. The organisation said five people had been killed yesterday in a separate blast. Elsewhere, there have been blasts reported in other parts of the south and in central Gaza. Red Sea. The US, UK and 10 other states have warned Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen - who've declared support for Hamas in the war - that they'll face consequences if they continue to attack commercial shipping in the Red Sea. Since November, the rebels have attacked commercial shipping in the Red Sea more than 20 times. Blinken visit. And finally, Secretary of State Antony Blinken will leave the US later tonight and head for the Middle East. An unnamed senior US official told Reuters he'll stop in a number of places, including Israel, but didnâ€™t provide any further details. It'll be Blinken's fourth trip to the region since the war broke out last year. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
