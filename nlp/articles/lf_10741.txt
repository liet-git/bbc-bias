Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant has dismissed the ICJ's rulings for Israel to do more to ensure it prevents any acts that could be considered genocidal. "The state of Israel does not need to be lectured on morality in order to distinguish between terrorists and the civilian population in Gaza," he posted to social media, calling South Africa's submission "antisemitic". "The IDF and security agencies will continue operating to dismantle the military and governing capabilities of the Hamas terrorist organisation, and to return the hostages to their homes. I have full confidence in our troops," he said. Israel's Foreign Minister Israel Katz also took to social media to say his country was committed to international law and existed "independently of any ICJ proceedings", as did "Israel's right to defend itself". Following the ICJ's ruling, he told Israel's legal team: "You have represented Israel and the Jewish people with honour. You have made us proud. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
