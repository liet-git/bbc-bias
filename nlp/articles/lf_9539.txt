T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. The head of the Norwegian Refugee Council, Jan Egeland, has been telling the BBC about his recent visit to Gaza where he ate meals with the World Central Kitchen (WCK). “There is no nobler task," he says. “I saw the good work of these very compassionate people helping the civilian population. " Egeland says WCK had close coordination with the Israeli Defence Forces and always notified them about their movements in what is called a "deconfliction" system. “This is a war machine totally out of control in Gaza,” he says, adding that more aid workers have been killed in Gaza "than in any other conflict". Egeland emphasised there are two crossings close to the north of Gaza - the Karni crossing and the Erez crossing - that need to be opened to avoid more risk of famine and disease. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
