We're getting in pictures now of the situation in Gaza, as people are evacuating the areas surrounding al-Shifa hospital following a raid overnight by the Israel Defence Forces. Gazans have been pictured walking with some of their belongings after they were instructed to relocate to a  "humanitarian area". Here's some images from the scene: Displaced Gazans that were sheltering in the al-Shifa hospital have begun making their way to the coastal road towards Al-Mawasi in the southern Gaza Strip. "In order to maintain your security, you must immediately evacuate the area," an Israeli military spokesman  said on social media. Civilians have been ordered to move to Al-Mawasi, a zone designated as safe by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), more than a dozen times previously. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
