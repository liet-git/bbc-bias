T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. We've also just been hearing from war cabinet member Benny Gantz who says the partnership between the US and Israel is "a strategic partnership" and "a partnership of values". "The United States stood with Israel in its most difficult hour, and the attacks on it by irresponsible ministers are ungrateful, intended for domestic needs and stemming from political considerations," Gantz says, referring to earlier comments towards the US by National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir. "I maintain and will continue to maintain direct dialogue on many sensitive issues that have a dramatic impact on Israel's security, and I believe that important arms shipments will continue," the minister adds. His remarks follow US President Joe Biden's warning that Washington would halt arms shipments to Israel if it launched a ground offensive in the southern Gazan city of Rafah. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
