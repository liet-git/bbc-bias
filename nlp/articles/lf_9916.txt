As we've been reporting, Israel launched a wave of deadly strikes overnight to accompany its hostage raid in the south of Gaza. Now, the Palestinian Authority's foreign ministry has condemned what it called an Israeli "massacre" in Rafah. The PA, which controls the occupied West Bank, says the strikes killed 100 people and injured many more. However, we've received conflicting reports on the death toll. A spokesman for the Hamas-controlled health ministry in Gaza said at least 67 Palestinians were killed, with earlier reports saying it was "about 100". In a statement on X, the ministry claimed that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu "commits mass massacres with a mentality of revenge, not victory and not in accordance with international law, as he claims". Netanyahu has vowed to press on with the military offensive in Gaza. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
