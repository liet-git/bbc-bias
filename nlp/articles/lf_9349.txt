Earlier we told you about Samira Noorallah , 65, whose husband died of a stroke. She reconnected with us, sending this note: Today we woke up to fear and terror for the young and the old. The reason is the drone because 24/7 this drone is flying to film, gather information. God only knows. We can’t reassure our kids because we ourselves are already scared. We think that it may hit us and may not. We are living in fear, fear, fear. We are in constant fear it will bomb us … we live in a cinematic movie of fear. As I am talking to you the drone is flying above us! T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
