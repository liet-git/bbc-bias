The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) sees Jenin as a centre for Palestinian armed factions, including militants from the Islamic Jihad movement. Medical staff I spoke to by phone in Jenin say they could not reach the injured for hours, as the government hospital in the city was under siege, surrounded by Israeli troops, while tear gas bombs were thrown in its courtyard.
