T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken says the US is carefully reviewing Israel's investigation into the strike that killed seven aid workers in Gaza. "It's very important that Israel is taking full responsibility for this incident. It's also important that it appears to be taking steps to hold those responsible accountable",  he tells reporters in Brussels. "Even more important is making sure that steps are taken going forward to ensure that something like this can never happen again. " He says Israel has to “prioritise the protection of civilians” when carrying out military operations against Hamas. “It has to make that job number one. Their safety has to be a priority and military operations need to be designed around their protection, not the other way around,” he adds. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
