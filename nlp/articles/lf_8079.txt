In the last few moments, we've just heard from Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer in some of his first comments since yesterday's chaos unfolded in the Commons. He is "categorically" denying threatening Sir Lindsay Hoyle to select his party's amendment in the Gaza ceasefire debate in a move that unleashed parliamentary chaos. The Labour leader says he "simply urged" the Commons Speaker to have "the broadest possible debate" by putting a number of options in front of MPs during the Gaza ceasefire debate. Speaking at a train depot in Sussex, he went on to tell reporters: "I can categorically tell you that I did not threaten the Speaker in any way whatsoever. "I simply urged [him] to ensure that we have the broadest possible debate. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
