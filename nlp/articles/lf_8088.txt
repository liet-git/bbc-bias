T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Shadow leader of the house, Lucy Powell , is up now and she starts by saying that "yesterday was a very difficult day in the House of Commons". "We did not show ourselves at our best. " She says most MPs think the Speaker "always has the best intentions" in his decisions and she is grateful to him for trying to enable the widest possible views to be expressed. There is laughter and jeering in the chamber when when she says that no one could have expected events to unfold as they did. Deputy Speaker Rosie Winterton quickly interjects to tell MPs off for shouting at Powell and reminds them to be calm. Powell says the government raised a number of questions when it decided to withdraw from yesterday's debate. She goes on to say the MPs should remember the debate is about life and death, war and conflict and how the UK can play a part in bringing about a lasting peace. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
