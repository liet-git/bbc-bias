The crossing was already closed after a rocket attack by Hamas fighters over the weekend killed four Israeli soldiers in the area. Hamas's armed wing, which claimed responsibility for Sunday's rocket attack, said in a statement that it had "targeted the gathering of enemy forces" at Kerem Shalom in today's latest attack. The Israeli Defense Forces posted on X that sirens had sounded in the Kerem Shalom crossing area, after "launches were fired from Gaza". T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
