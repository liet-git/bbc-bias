On Thursday the US ambassador to the United Nations indicated she hoped to bring a resolution supporting calls for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and the release of hostages held by Hamas to the Security Council as soon as possible. Linda Thomas-Greenfield said changes to the US proposal had been made in consultation with other countries, including Arab nations. The move has already been supported by Antony Blinken, who said the move would send a "strong message". Speaking at a news conference in Cairo yesterday Blinken said the gaps were â€œnarrowing" in talks towards an agreement on the release of hostages and a ceasefire. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
