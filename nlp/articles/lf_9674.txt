T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres says today's resolution "must be implemented" to secure a ceasefire and the "immediate and unconditional release of all hostages". "Failure would be unforgivable," he says on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. Guterres has repeatedly called for Israel to give "total" access to humanitarian goods throughout Gaza, where the UN says some 1.1m people are struggling with catastrophic hunger and starvation. "It is time to silence the guns," he said at the Rafah crossing between Egypt and Gaza last week. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
