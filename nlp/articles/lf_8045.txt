It’s not just the war in Gaza that’s been on Antony Blinken’s agenda on his visit to the Middle East. A visit to Saudi Arabia on Wednesday made “very good progress” towards normalising relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, he said, something that has been delayed by the war. The top US diplomat said he could not "put a time frame on it", but that discussions were "getting close to a point where we'll have agreements". Saudi Arabia -  which positions itself as a leader in the Middle East and the Islamic world - never formally recognised Israel after its creation in 1948, and a deal normalising ties would represent a major breakthrough. The US is a close ally of both countries, and before the outbreak of war, talks were “getting closer”. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
