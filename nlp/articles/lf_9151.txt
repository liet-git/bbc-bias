US officials say Israel hit Iran with a missile overnight on Friday, in what appears to be a retaliatory strike after weeks of escalating tensions between the two countries. But there has been no official confirmation of what exactly happened. Iranian state media downplayed its significance and the Israeli military has not commented on the incident. What is Iran saying about the strike? Iran's Fars news agency reported that explosions were heard near an army base in Isfahan and that air defence systems were activated. Iranian state TV said three drones were destroyed in the sky and no ground explosions occurred. A senior Iranian official told Reuters: "We have not received any external attack, and the discussion leans more towards infiltration than attack". Was Israel involved? Israel does not routinely confirm its military actions, which have targeted Iranian-backed armed groups in Syria and Iraq on many occasions. US officials have told the BBC's partner CBS News that an Israeli missile hit Iran in the early hours of Friday. Israel previously said it would retaliate against Iran's attack at the weekend, which involved hundreds of drones and missiles in response to a suspected Israeli strike on its embassy compound in Syria. Isfahan province is a large area in the centre of Iran home to significant Iranian military infrastructure, including a large airbase, a major missile production complex and several nuclear facilities.
