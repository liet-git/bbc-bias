We're going to bring our live coverage to an end shortly, but before we do here's a brief overview of what happened today: The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) chief of staff said Iran's attack on Saturday "will be met with a response", after the country's war cabinet held discussions earlier today. An IDF spokesperson said: "We will do whatever is necessary to protect the state of Israel, and we will do it at the opportunity and the time we will choose" Earlier Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said his country's attack on Israel amounted to "exercising the right of legitimate defence" and said it would not hesitate to protect its interests in the future. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak called on "all sides" to "show restraint", with a number of countries also urging against escalation. Both the White House and UK Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron described Iranâ€™s attack as a failure. Belgium, France and Germany are among several countries to have summoned Iranian ambassadors, adding to growing condemnation and mounting international pressure on Tehran. Meanwhile, US National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby claimed the amount of aid getting into Gaza has increased "quite dramatically" in recent days. But many Gazans are still displaced by fighting and unable to return home, with aid agencies warning that famine is imminent. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
