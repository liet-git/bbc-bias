T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Let's bring you some fresh comments from Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk who says Israel should "pay damages" to the family of a Polish aid worker Damian Sobol who died on Monday. The 36-year-old came from the south-eastern Polish city of Przemy≈õl and was one of the seven World Central Kitchen (WCK) aid workers who were killed on Monday's strike in Gaza. "We will expect an immediate explanation of the circumstances and compensation for the victims' relatives," Tusk told a news conference. Israel has said the strike, on the clearly-marked convoy, was a mistake, and has promised a thorough investigation. Previously in the aftermath of the fatal attack, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged the Israeli military hit "innocent people", describing it as tragic and unintentional.
