The news outlet Al-Araby al-Jadeed has condemned what it describes as the "humiliating" detention of its Gaza correspondent Diaa Kahlout by Israeli forces earlier today. In a statement, it said Kahlout's brothers, relatives and a large number of civilians were also detained by the Israeli forces in Beit Lahia, a city in the north of Gaza. It adds soldiers forced them "to disrobe, and subjected them to invasive searches and humiliating treatment upon their arrest, prior to transporting them to undisclosed locations". The outlet "urges the international community, journalistsâ€™ rights defenders and watchdogs, and human rights bodies to denounce this ongoing assault" by Israel on journalists in the territory. The BBC has asked the Israeli military about Kahlout's reported detention. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
