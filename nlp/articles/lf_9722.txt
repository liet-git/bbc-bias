A little earlier, Jo Floto, the BBC's Middle East bureau chief, brought us the breaking news that the Israeli military had sacked two of its senior officers over a strike that killed several humanitarian aid workers in Gaza. Here, he explains a bit more about how that information was relayed to journalists: Late on Thursday night, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) convened a meeting for a group of international journalists at the defence ministry building in Tel Aviv. The IDF then set out for us the results of their initial inquiry into the killing of seven aid workers in Gaza. Retired Maj Gen Yoav Har-Even described how the IDF's drone operators mistook an aid worker carrying a bag for a gunman, and then targeted one of the World Central Kitchen vehicles with a missile. The IDF then described how two people escaped that vehicle and got into a second car, which was hit by another missile from a drone.
