He said that no timeframe had been announced and that the evacuation affecting an estimated 100,000 people would be carried out in “a gradual way”. However, that will not allay the fears of locals and more than one million displaced Palestinians crammed into Gaza’s southernmost city that a wider offensive is on the cards. For months, Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been insisting that victory against Hamas cannot be won without a full-scale offensive there. Israel says Rafah harbours four remaining Hamas battalions – amounting to thousands of fighters. Western and Arab powers as well as the UN have repeatedly warned against such a wide ground operation in Rafah, because of the prospect of high numbers of civilian casualties. Officials from Israel and its closest ally, the US, have been holding meetings to discuss alternative, more focused plans.  It is not clear if the new evacuation orders are part of those.
