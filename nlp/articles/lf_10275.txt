War is a cruel furnace that puts humans through terrible agonies. But its heat can produce changes that seemed impossible. It happened in western Europe after World War Two. Old enemies who had killed each other for centuries chose peace. Will the war in Gaza shock Israelis and Palestinians into ending their century of conflict over the land between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan river? One idea mentioned by senior Western diplomats is to make Palestinian independence a crucial part of a broader package of change in the Middle East. Israel would be offered the prize of mutual recognition with Saudi Arabia, if they made the concessions necessary for Palestinian independence. It is an ambitious idea, that would not happen without new Israeli and Palestinian leaders who believed in the project. And the war in Gaza would have to end as soon as possible. If it spreads, nightmare scenarios include desperate Palestinians breaching the Egyptian border as Israeli tanks close in and the escalation of the current cross-border exchanges between Israel and the Lebanese militia group Hezbollah into a full-scale war. So much needs to go right for peace to have a chance. So much has already gone wrong that peace might just be impossible. Read Jeremy's full analysis on the prospects for a resolution here.
