The organisers of a protest vote movement say they will join the student activists camping at the University of Michigan. The leaders of the Uncommitted movement told Reuters news agency that they would travel to join protesters on the campus in Ann Arbor, about an hour west of Detroit. The movement began as a group called Listen to Michigan. Earlier this year they urged voters in that state to vote “Uncommitted” – a ballot option in several US states – rather than for Joe Biden in the state's Democratic primary. More than 100,000 did so - 13% of Democratic voters who turned out. Michigan, which Biden won narrowly in 2020, is a key battleground state in November’s presidential election. Uncommitted activist Abbas Alawieh told Reuters: "President Biden is choosing to put his hands over his ears and ignore the hundreds of thousands of people who have already come out against the war at the ballot box.
