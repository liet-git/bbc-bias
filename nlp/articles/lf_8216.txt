SNP MP Brendan O'Hara attacks the decision of the government to pursue the language of a "humanitarian pause" rather than a ceasefire. He calls it a "convoluted idea" which will mean that "the carnage [can] resume at a pre-arranged date and time". The government has said that the pause will allow for further negotiation and full resolution. But O'Hara says the UK's response has diminished its reputation which means that it will not have credibility in any future negotiations. He finishes this part of his statement by talking of the impact on children and innocent civilians in Gaza. Israel have "completely abandon[ed] international humanitarian law by imposing collective punishment on a defenceless civilian population", he concludes. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
