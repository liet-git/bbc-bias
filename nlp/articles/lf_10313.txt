T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. We do not know the full details yet of what is included in the proposed Gaza ceasefire deal, including what it says about the idea of a permanent cessation of military operations:  Does it mean the war will ultimately end or not? Because on that point both sides seem still to be in a different position. It’s on that detail that everything matters.  And everything that is going on is part of this negotiation. It’s not just the talks that are taking place either in Doha or in Cairo.  The statement that Hamas made yesterday, that is part of the negotiation. The Israeli statements about what it may or may not do in Rafah are part of the negotiation. The Israeli actions in Rafah are all part of the negotiation. Each side is trying to put pressure on the other. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
