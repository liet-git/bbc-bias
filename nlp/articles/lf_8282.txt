As we’ve been reporting, MPs will vote later today on the SNP ’s call for an immediate ceasefire in the Israel-Gaza war. It is the second such motion tabled by the party.

Now, Labour is for the first time since the conflict broke out calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza - language it will pose as an amendment, or change, to the SNP’s. "We do have that broad consensus now for an immediate ceasefire,  although the odd word is different," SNP Westminster leader Stephen Flynn told BBC Breakfast this morning. "Yesterday, I was pleased that after months and months of public and parliamentary pressure… the leader of the Labour party Sir Keir Starmer has changed his position," he added. "It was long overdue, but it’s good to have that consensus on the opposition benches," Flynn said. "That should put collective pressure on the UK government to change its stance.
