 F-N-S-T-A-R-T. 10066 F-N-E-N-D.  D-A-T-E-S-T-A-R-T. 2024-04-14 D-A-T-E-E-N-D.  T-I-T-L-E-S-T-A-R-T. How could Israel respond to Iranian attack? T-I-T-L-E-E-N-D.  T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. This could still get a whole lot worse. Israel has vowed "a significant response" to Iran’s overnight missile attack. But what form will that take? Israel’s military and its war cabinet have been debating exactly that. The most likely targets will be the Iranian bases that launched those missiles. But Israel could well decide to go further and strike major Iranian military bases and training centres of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Corps across the country, inflicting human casualties as well as material damage. Iran would then, undoubtedly, respond again, as it has vowed to do. So we are now on the ‘middle rung’, as it were, of a very dangerous escalatory ladder. Governments in the Middle East will be holding their breath as they wait to see the extent and ferocity of Israel’s promised response. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
