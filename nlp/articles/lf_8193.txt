T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. We are hearing again from Layla Moran, a Liberal Democrat MP. She says that she is "speechless with the way this debate began". "There has been scant opportunity for me to be able to tell the story of not just my family but hundreds more of those in the church in northern Gaza and all in Palestine," she adds. She asks all the MPs to "hold all these people in their hearts". Moran says she believes the House is moving towards "a right position". She adds she wants to send a message to the Palestinians perishing in their tents on the ground, and to the hostages' families, and she hopes for an immediate ceasefire. "We need this to stop now and I don't care what we call it," she says. Moran concludes her comments saying "without a two-state solution on 1967 borders we are condemning both Israelis and Palestinians to reliving this nightmare over and over again". T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
