With the sheer amount of reporting there is about the war, it can be hard to remember what's happening in Gaza and Israel day-to-day. Here's a reminder of Thursday's main developments. Talks: There was another lengthy closed door session of the UN security Council, as officials try to get through the aid resolution we've mentioned. Separately, negotiations continued in Cairo, Egypt, to broker a new truce and secure the release of more Israeli hostages. Hostages: Hamas said Palestinian groups reject the prospect of more hostages being released until Israel agrees to end the war in Gaza, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the war in Gaza will not stop until Israel achieves all of its goals. Hospitals: The World Health Organization said northern Gaza has been left without a functional hospital due to lack of fuel, staff and supplies. Humanitarian crisis: As we've been reporting, the World Food Programme warned Gaza faces a famine in the next six months if the conflict continues. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
