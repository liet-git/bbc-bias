T-I-T-L-E-E-N-D.  T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Israel will "exact a price" from Iran in response to its attack on the country when the time is right, war cabinet minister Benny Gantz says. In a statement released a short while ago - just before Israel's war cabinet convened - Gantz says: "We will build a regional coalition and exact the price from Iran in the fashion and timing that is right for us. "And most importantly, faced with the desire of our enemies to harm us, we will continue to unite and become stronger. " Separately, Gantz says he has just finished speaking with German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock. "We discussed first and foremost the imperative of forming a global united front to counter emboldened Iranian aggression directly and through its proxies - regionally and globally," Gantz says in a social media post. Israeli war cabinet began meeting at 15:00 local time (13:00 BST). We'll be bringing you any updates that we get from that meeting shortly. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
