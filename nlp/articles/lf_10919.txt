Kibbutz Kfar Aza , around 3 kilometres (2 miles) from the border with the Gaza Strip, was one of the communities worst affected. Around 70 gunmen stormed the kibbutz, killing more than 60 residents. Some 18 people from the community were among those who were kidnapped and taken back to Gaza by Hamas and several are still being held. Thirty kilometres away, Kibbutz Nir Oz suffered another devastating attack. The majority of the kibbutz's security team were killed or taken hostage while attempting to defend the community. Members of Hamas then spent several hours in the kibbutz, killing civilians, abducting hostages, and setting fires to homes. It is thought that 180 of the roughly 400 residents were killed or taken hostage during the attack, with The Jerusalem Post estimating 80 abductions in Nir Oz. Several people initially taken hostage from the kibbutz were later released, including the 85-year-old Yafa Adar who was taken to Gaza on a golf cart, and whose granddaughter Adva spoke to BBC News.
