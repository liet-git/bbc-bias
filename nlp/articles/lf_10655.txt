The UN has described the last "barely functioning" hospital in northern Gaza as a "humanitarian disaster zone" - with corridors overflowing with patients and doctors treating people on the floors. Al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City is severely short-staffed, with over 200 patients but only enough resources to support 40, said Dr Richard Peeperkorn, the World Health Organisation's representative in Gaza said in a briefing with reporters. As they are unable to perform vascular surgeries, staff have taken to amputating people's limbs "as the last resort to save lives", he said. In the whole of Gaza there are now only 11 functioning hospitals - down from 36, the World Health Organization says. Al-Ahli hospital was hit by a blast in October which Israeli and Palestinian officials have blamed on each other. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
