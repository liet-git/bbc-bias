T-I-T-L-E-E-N-D.  T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Ian Paisley, DUP MP, is now up and says that the house is being asked to vote for a motion [the SNP's] that doesn't contain any word about the "rape of women, the murder of children" or the "unjustifiable" attack on Israel. "It's as if, Mr Deputy Speaker, it didn't happen. It's as if it was invisible, it's as if, like other people in the 20th century denied things that happened to Israel and the Jewish people. That's essentially what we're seeing tonight, the denial of an attack on Israel," Paisley says as MPs erupt in protest. He gives way to a very cross Kirsten Oswald (SNP) who says that "we all want people to stop being killed, women and children particularly". But, she says, his remarks "where he was conflating things that should never be conflated, do not show this house in the best way". T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
