After months of geopolitical brinkmanship and squabbling over semantics among the Security Council's permanent members, it took the action of the 10 elected members to finally get a resolution passed. Their proposal - calling both for an immediate ceasefire and the release of hostages - was put forward with diplomatic frustrations mounting over the deadlock. And it worked. What made the difference, though, was the shifting stance of the US - choosing this time to abstain rather than wielding its veto, a sign of its growing rift with its staunch ally Israel over the way it's prosecuting the war. The big question now is how much difference the resolution will make. Even leaving aside the debate about whether this resolution is binding, there are few options for enforcing it. It is certainly high on symbolism, but may well prove to be low on substance. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
