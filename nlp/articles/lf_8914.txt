The UK’s representative is now speaking, saying it’s heart wrenching to see aid pile up outside Gaza but not getting to people who need it. “It is heart-breaking to see children in the rubble of their destroyed homes, not knowing where to find food or water, not knowing where their parents are,” she says. “We were the first country to call on Israel to open more crossings,” she says, adding that every effort must be made to get aid in faster. She also says the actions of the Security Council must ensure the horror the Hamas attack on 7 October never happens again. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
