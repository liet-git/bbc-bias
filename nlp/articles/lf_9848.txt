People in Gaza are falling victim to price-gouging by food merchants amid shortages, ordinary Palestinians have told the BBC. Jihad Abu Sharkh said he had to leave his home in northern Gaza for  Rafah in the south, where many displaced Palestinians are sheltering - but food there is becoming a luxury item. "We are under the mercy of the merchants who buy an item for 10 shekels then sell it for two hundred or two hundred and fifty shekels," he said. "For example, they buy a bag of flour from the warehouse of supplies for 60 shekels and then sell it to us for 300 shekels. " He called on the "whole world to stand against the food dealers of war and put an end to their monopoly". Jamal Abu Alyan, also in southern Gaza, said: "Wherever we go, we suffer from the monopoly of dealers. . . " Another man in Rafah told the BBC: "A lot of people sleep without eating or drinking, while others have become beggars due to the lack of food and drink, and food dealersâ€™ manipulation. " The United Nations has previously warned Gaza is experiencing acute food shortages and faces famine. Palestinians say food sellers have put up prices of even basic items. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
