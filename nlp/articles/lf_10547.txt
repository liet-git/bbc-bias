Truce talks are resuming in Cairo, with delegations from Israel, Hamas and the US meeting with mediators to broker a ceasefire. Let's take a look at where those negotiations stand: Hamas said on Monday that it had accepted a ceasefire proposal from Egypt and Qatar, the basis of which is a weeks-long pause in the fighting and the release of several dozen hostages still held in Gaza. But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the proposal approved by Hamas was unacceptable because it was "very far from Israel's necessary requirements". He said he had instructed the mid-level Israeli delegation sent to Cairo to "stand firm" on the conditions required for the return of the hostages and on "vital requirements for ensuring Israel's security". On Wednesday, Hamas said it would not make more concessions to Israel in the ceasefire talks. In a statement, Izzat El-Reshiq, a member of Hamas' political office in Qatar, said the group would not go beyond a ceasefire proposal it accepted on Monday. Israel did not respond immediately to the statement. Read more: Israel takes Rafah crossing as truce talks continue. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
