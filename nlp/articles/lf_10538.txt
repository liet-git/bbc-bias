T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Lebanon's civil defence says four people were killed in an Israeli strike on a vehicle in southern Lebanon, with a security source telling AFP they were members of Hezbollah - the Iran-backed Shia group. Israel has been carrying out strikes on southern Lebanon almost daily since Hezbollah fired rockets at Israel on 8 October in support of Hamas in Gaza, triggering an escalating series of attacks and counter-attacks. The Israeli army told AFP news agency that it does not comment on reports in the foreign media. The Israeli army says it targets Hezbollah members and infrastructure, and retaliates to attacks on Israeli army bases in northern Israel. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
