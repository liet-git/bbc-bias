The UN has dismissed claims that it is biased over the Israel-Gaza conflict, insisting: "The only side that we are on is on the side of saving lives. " On Wednesday, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres wrote a letter to members of the Security Council, invoking a UN article not used in decades and urging them to help avert a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. Israel said he had reached a new moral low and this was proof of his bias against them. Speaking on the Today programme on BBC Radio 4, Stephane Dujarric, a spokesman for Guterres,  said it was very rare for a secretary-general to invoke the article, but he had been compelled to do so because of the extent of "appalling human suffering". Dujarric said there must be a ceasefire, saying any further collapse of the order of society in Gaza "would very easily have a catastrophic impact on the region as a whole". "I don't think anyone can look the other way," he added. "The members of the Security Council all have a responsibility to use their influence to try to end this crisis. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
