BBC Verify has been looking at video claiming to show evidence of damage caused by Israeli vehicles to graves in a cemetery in northern Gaza. Social media posts show several deeply-rutted tracks in the earth, and damaged headstones littering the ground at al-Faluja cemetery near the Jabaliya refugee camp. Weâ€™ve confirmed the location by comparing tall buildings visible in the video with existing imagery online. A satellite image from 10 December reveals what looks like bulldozer activity in part of this cemetery. Disturbances to the earth in the image on the right are not visible in an image of the same area taken four days earlier. An IDF social media post on 9 December shows Israeli soldiers fighting in the Jabaliya area close to the cemetery. We've approached the IDF to ask if its forces entered the cemetery causing the damage visible in these images. Vehicle tracks and damaged gravestones can be seen. Tracks are visible in the satellite image on the right. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
