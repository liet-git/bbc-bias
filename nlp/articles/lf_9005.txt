Rocket sirens have been sounding in Israel's southern communities near the Gaza border on Thursday. The alert system identified the kibbutzim of Ein HaShlosha and Nirim were being targeted by rockets from the Gaza Strip. Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad and other groups regularly fire rockets towards Israel. Israel's missile defence system, the Iron Dome , intercepts the majority of missiles aimed at the country, but casualties and damage still occurs. In an earlier incident, sirens were sounded in the Krayot area in northern Israel. The IDF says it was in response to a drone crossing from Lebanon into Israeli territory and was intercepted.
