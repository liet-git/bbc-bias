In a new statement about the ongoing raids, al-Qudra said troops "stormed" the maternity building earlier and are carrying out a search inside it. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have claimed Hamas fighters were hiding inside and that Israeli hostages' bodies might also be there. A spokesperson for Hamas denied that, calling it "lies". IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari said forces were aiming to reach Hamas fighters inside, "including those suspected of involvement in the 7 October massacre". T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
