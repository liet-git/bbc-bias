Earlier we reported that a vessel traveling in the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait was hit by a missile fired from areas of Yemen held by Iran-backed Houthi rebels. A marine traffic website lists the vessel, Strinda, as a Norwegian-flagged oil and chemical tanker. No group has claimed responsibility for the attacks yet, but this is not the first report of a strike linked to the Houthis. The group claimed two of three attacks on commercial vessels passing through the Red Sea on 3 December. The first vessel was hit by a missile and the second vessel was struck by a drone while it was in the Bab el-Mandeb Strait. In response, a US warship shot down three drones fired from Houthi-controlled areas. The clashes lasted for more than seven hours. Late last month, armed Houthi fighters hijacked a cargo ship in the southern Red Sea. The group claimed the ship, operated by a Japanese company, was linked to Israel. The Houthis had said it will target all ships heading north to Israel, while the US has vowed to "consider all appropriate responses" to the attacks. The Houthis have declared themselves part of an "axis of resistance" of Iran-affiliated groups, which works in opposition to Israel, the US, and the wider West. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
