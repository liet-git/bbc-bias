The representative from China is now speaking. He starts off by saying, "for reasons known to all, this draft resolution has made quite a number of adjustments". He says the adjustments do not meet China’s expectations, but they voted yes because of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. He says the resolution does provide a “glimmer of hope”, but it comes down to if the resolution can be implemented on the ground. He goes on to say only a ceasefire can prevent things from spiralling further out of control. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
