For some observers, the protests at Columbia and other US college campuses echo the 1960s, when demonstrations against the Vietnam War rocked the country. Among those who see parallels is Marianne Hirsch, a literature professor who also specialises in Holocaust studies. Speaking to reporters this week, Hirsch - who participated in the 1960s protest movement - said that in her opinion, the war in Vietnam and the current war in Gaza made it "impossible to continue business as usual". “People in this world are feeling that what is happening in Gaza is unbearable and that they have to act,” she said. Another veteran of the 1960s protest movement  and author of a book on the movement and mass arrests that took place in Columbia at the time, Oren Root, told the BBC that while he saw significant parallels, he believed opposition to the protests today was much more intense. “The politicisation is much more extreme,” said Root, a 1969 Columbia graduate. “There were certainly conservative politicians in 1968 who were opposed and severely criticised the protest movements, but the world is different now. ”. “The internet and social media are a big factor,” he said, adding that it helped amplify accusations that the protests were antisemitic. “It ramps up emotional, political and personal aspects of the opposition in ways that are really unfortunate. ”.
