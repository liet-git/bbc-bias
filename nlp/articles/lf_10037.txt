T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. With the official inflation rate standing at just over 40% and tens of millions of people struggling with the cost of living, a military confrontation with Israel was the last thing most Iranians wanted. Since the attack on the Iranian consulate in Damascus on 1 April, the value of the Iranian currency, Rial, has fallen by another 10% against the US Dollar. Many are worried that, sooner or later, this will hike the prices of many goods, from mobile phones to home appliances and many foodstuff. The Iranian government sets the price of some essential items such as bread and fuel, and lets many items be imported on a preferential exchange rate (in other words cheap foreign currency). But still the price of many goods follow the open market exchange rate. Since the US left the Iranian nuclear deal in 2018 and re-imposed wide-ranging sanctions on Iran, especially curbing its ability to export crude oil, the Iranian economy has struggled with low (or even negative growth) and high rates of inflation. What worries many people in Iran right now is how Israel might respond. Any further escalation could devalue its currency more, which would push up the prices even more, deepening the current cost of living crisis. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
