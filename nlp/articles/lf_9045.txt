We've just seen live footage of dozens of students fleeing as police entered Dickson Court, where the main protest camp is set up. Dozens of officers are now inside the area. Many demonstrators appear to have left but some remain, though appear to be surrounded by police. Officers are now tearing down tents and appear to have the square largely under control. It's unclear if protesters have set up elsewhere on campus. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
