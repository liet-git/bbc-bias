There was so much discussion in the run-up to the Iranian strike, which was telegraphed by the US, with Joe Biden days ago saying that an attack was imminent and that it would happen sooner rather than later. Then, there was the unnamed military sources in the US, speaking about the kind of attack that did indeed unfold in the early hours of the morning. Iran has cast this as a limited, carefully calibrated strike. It caused limited damage, but here in Israel and amongst its allies, they're now looking at this strike. And even though the US and the UK are urging restraint, Israel says it is now looking at its options. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
