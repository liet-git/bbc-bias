Melanie Ward, CEO of Medical Aid for Palestinians, tells BBC News "we are in the midst of the worst humanitarian catastophe that any of us that work in Gaza have ever known". She says that even when aid gets in to the territory, "it's not possible to distribute it to the people in need because the scale of the Israeli bombardments are so ferocious". "Order is breaking down in Gaza, that's very clear. . . All of the public services - whether that's the civil defence who used to dig people out of the rubble, the police force, the hospitals, the health systems - all of these things are slowly being taken apart by the attacks on them," she says. "In all honesty, words are becoming completely inadequate to describe the horrors of the situation on the ground, including for my own staff. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
