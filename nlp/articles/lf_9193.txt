The Iranians are playing down the significance of what's happened. They're saying there has been no attack. Official media have posted jokey photos of miniature drones. Several questions arise. Will hardliners in Iran's IRGC want to push back? Has Israel plans for more attacks? This could be PM Netanyahu's attempt to respond, without alienating President Biden any more than he has already. Biden has asked Israel not to respond to last Saturday's attack by Iran, to 'take the win'. Britain and other allies of Israel have contributed their own calls for restraint. If this is it, another question is whether it will be enough for the former generals in Israel's war cabinet who are believed to want a strong response to, as they see it, restore Israel's capacity to deter its enemies. Netanyahu's ultranationalist coalition allies have also demanded a fierce retaliation from Israel. One said the Israelis needed to "go berserk". The best option for the region, in the opinion of western governments, is for both Iran and Israel to draw a line under the saga. It started with Israel's attack on the Iranian diplomatic compound in Damascus, killing at least seven people including three generals. Even if this is the end of this stage of this crisis, new precedents have been set. Iran has hit Israel in a direct attack, and Israel has responded with its own direct attack. That's a change in  what's often referred to in the region as the 'rules of the game'  of the long conflict between Iran and Israel. The long clandestine war between the two countries has come out of the shadows. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
