BBC Verify has analysed a video provided by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) of last night’s hostage rescue. We have located the operation to a district of Rafah dominated by plastic greenhouses. We did this by locating photos and videos uploaded this morning to social media by photojournalists and citizens inside Gaza. The material, and the IDF’s own video footage, showed at least three huge craters as well as destroyed buildings and plastic greenhouses. We then used satellite images to match key features - such as a tall funnel-like structure in the distance, distinctive buildings and the layout of the greenhouses themselves. We used the position of the sun to orient each different view. Additionally, the IDFs drone footage matches the buildings at the location. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
