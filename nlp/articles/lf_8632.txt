In the past week, we have been reporting that Egypt was trying to bring about a new deal that could lead to renewable ceasefires in the Gaza Strip and the release of more of the Israeli hostages held by Hamas. Now reports in the Arab media suggest that Cairo has suspended its mediation efforts following the assassination of Saleh al-Arouri .  It is also said that a scheduled visit by an Israeli delegation to the Egyptian capital has been postponed. We have not been able to get official confirmation of that from Egypt. A Saudi media outlet citing a Hamas source had already reported on Tuesday that Hamas had decided to suspend talks about a possible ceasefire in response to the killing. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
