Yesterday, I spent much of the afternoon speaking to students at Columbia University, where the protests against the Gaza war have been marred by allegations of harassment and antisemitic incidents. Several Jewish students told me they were concerned about a threatening campus environment. Guy Sela, an Israeli Columbia student - and a veteran of the Israel Defense Forces - told the BBC he believed "every Israeli Jewish student" at the university had faced "at least one antisemitic act", whether verbal or physical, since the protest began. "I've been threatened here, called names like murderer, butcher and rapist, just because I was born in Israel," he said. Jonathan Swill, a 27-year old master's student from New Jersey, told the BBC he was moving to Israel after graduation, having turned down a place in a doctoral programme at Columbia. "I just can't stay here anymore," he said. "This place is uncomfortable for me. Every time I wake up, I dread having to come to campus. I don't know when I'm going to have things thrown at me. " Another Jewish student - who asked to remain anonymous, citing safety reasons - said his experiences with antisemitism on campus recently have been "emotionally exhausting" and have led to constant feelings of fear, particularly when leaving religious ceremonies. "I feel scared wearing my yarmulke," he said. "In the past week, there's definitely been a change. It's 100% as bad as everyone is saying. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
