The rarely-seen Israeli Druze community is seen in these images mourning IDF Staff Sergeant Sufian Dagash, who the Israeli military announced earlier today had been killed fighting in northern Gaza. The 21-year-old, who also served in the Engineering Corps, was from the Druze city of Maghar in northern Israel. Druze people are an Arab minority who live in several countries, including Israel, Syria and Lebanon. Although they speak Arabic as their mother tongue, the Druze are not Muslim - their faith is often classified as a branch of Isma'ili. The Israeli Druze community is the only major non-Jewish group in the country whose members are required to serve in the IDF. Israeli soldiers carry Sufian Dagash's casket in Maghar. Two women react as friends and family mourn Dagash. Druze men look on as an Israeli flag is draped over Dagash's casket. Druze women cry at the soldier's funeral. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
