White House national security spokesman John Kirby has told reporters that the US is "certainly concerned" about reports that Israel has used white phosphorus, supplied by America, in southern Lebanon. "We'll be asking questions to try to learn a little bit more," John Kirby told reporters, speaking aboard the presidential plane Air Force One. It follows a report in the Washington Post today , about an incident in October which Amnesty International said injured nine civilians and should be investigated as a war crime . Kirby said white phosphorus has a "legitimate military utility" and that "obviously, any time that we provide items like white phosphorous to another military, it is with the full expectation that it will be used in keeping with those legitimate purposes". White phosphorus munitions can legally be used on battlefields to make smoke screens, generate illumination, mark targets or burn bunkers and buildings. But they can also be extremely harmful, causing severe burns. A protocol to the 1980 Convention on Conventional Weapons bans the use of white phosphorus as an incendiary weapon against civilian populations or in air attacks against enemy forces in civilian areas. According to Reuters, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant was asked about the report and responded:  "The IDF and the entire security establishment acts according to international law.
