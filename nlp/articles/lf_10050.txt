The RAF sent additional planes to the region as part of existing operations to “counter Daesh in Iraq and Syria”. RAF planes shot down “a number of Iranian attack drones”. Sunak condemned the attack as a “dangerous and unnecessary escalation”. He confirmed he will be speaking to G7 leaders in the afternoon and urged for “calm heads to prevail”.
