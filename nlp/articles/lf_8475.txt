Spokesman for the Israel Defence Forces, Lt Col Richard Hecht, has told the BBC that the IDF's mistaken killing of three hostages was "a tragic, tragic, tragic event”. Yotam Haim, 28, Samer Talalka, 22, and Alon Shamriz, 26 were shot dead by Israeli military who mistook them as "terorrists" after escaping Hamas captivity in Gaza yesterday. “It was against the rules of engagement for the IDF," Hecht says. Speaking to the BBC’s Newshour programme, he says: “We’re still doing in-depth investigations into this event… this was against the rules of engagement, they shouldn’t have opened fire. A soldier felt threatened and he responded. We’re still talking to him, we’re going to support our soldiers. " "Mistakes happen in this kind of conflict", he says, adding "it’s a very complex situation” because the soldiers were in a combat zone and they were getting fired at. He says the soldiers responsible are not going to be punished. “These are our hostages, these are our soldiers…. first of all we’ll be giving help to these soldiers. They’re not going to be punished - they made a mistake, they made a mistake. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
