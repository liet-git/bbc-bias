BBC Verify is looking into several videos, released by the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF), claiming to show tunnel networks revealed under Gaza in the past 24 hours. One is filmed outside and the buildings can be identified. Using online tools like Google Earth and Bing Maps, we’ve located the video to an area around the Palestine Square roundabout in north-west Gaza City. The camera then leads into an adjacent garage, where there’s a large hole surrounded by a winch, a telephone and cement panelling. The shot has not been edited. Lieutenant Ido of the 401st Brigade then explains how all of these elements would aid a tunnel, which he claims was recently under construction. Looking on Google Earth, the location of the garage shows only a scaffold with a truck underneath it, dated from May 2022. However, looking on Bing Maps, a solid white roof can be seen at the same site, dating from August 2023. This suggests the garage was built relatively recently. Another video - published by the Times of Israel and incorporates two IDF videos – is longer and is an edit of indoor and outdoors shots. It’s also filmed in both daylight and at night-time and without continuity between the two. Indoor videos are usually much more challenging to verify. For one, there will be fewer landmarks to compare with online maps. However, the insides of buildings can sometimes be identified using old pictures of the interiors. Also, when two or more videos are edited together it becomes harder to say for certain where two locations are in relation to one another, say, a tunnel entrance and an identifiable street. Lieutenant Ido claimed that the tunnel was recently under construction. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
