Where this goes next from here depends in large part on how Israel decides to respond to last night's attack. Countries in the region and elsewhere, including those that deeply dislike the Iranian regime, have urged restraint. Iran's position is along the lines of: "Account settled, that is the end of the matter, do not hit back at us or we will mount a much stronger attack against you that you will not be able to ward off. " But, Israel has already vowed "a significant response" and its government has often been called one of the most hardline in Israeli history. So what are Israel's options?
