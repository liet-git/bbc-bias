The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has accused Hamas of “utter disinterest” in a negotiated ceasefire in Gaza. He claims the group’s apparent rejection of the latest truce proposal that would see the release of some Israeli hostages shows the “damage” done by the UN Security Council resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire . Hours after the Security Council voted for an immediate ceasefire and the unconditional release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas, the armed group gave its response to the latest truce plan put forward by mediators. It said it was sticking to its original position calling for a full ceasefire and laid out terms which the Israeli prime minister’s office on Tuesday called “delusional. ”. While Qatar, which is acting as a go-between for negotiations, says talks will continue, a halt to the fighting seems as far off as ever. On the ground, the latest Israeli air strikes have killed dozens of Palestinians at both ends of the Gaza Strip. The area around al-Shifa hospital was hit in the north as well as Rafah in the very south, where more than one million people have sought shelter. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
