Russia's ambassador to the Security Council Vasily Nebenzya made Moscow's opposition to the US draft resolution clear even before the vote. He accused the United States of doing nothing to rein in Israel in Gaza, and mocked Washington for speaking of a ceasefire after "Gaza has been virtually wiped off the face of the Earth". "We have observed a typical hypocritical spectacle," he said. Nebenzya said that the resolution would have "ensured the impunity of Israel, whose crimes are not even assessed in the draft".
