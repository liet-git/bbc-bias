More now on the news that Israel has rescued two male hostages - Fernando Simon Marman, 60, and Louis Har, 70 - from the southern city of Rafah. In a statement, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Daniel Hagari says Israeli forces broke into a building "in the heart of Rafah". The two men were found on the second floor being held by armed Hamas members in an apartment, he adds. Hagari says that from the moment of entry, troops shielded Marman and Har with their bodies, "initiating a daring battle and heavy exchanges of fire at several locations simultaneously". The pair were rescued from the apartment under fire, the spokesman says, as IDF forces "provided them [with] protection in the Rafah area until they reached a safe zone". Hagari says the raid was carried out in the early morning at 01:49 local time (23:49 GMT). "This is an operation we have been preparing for a while," Hagari says. The pair were taken from Nir Yitzhak kibbutz by Hamas on 7 October and had been held hostage since. IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari pictured in October 2023. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
