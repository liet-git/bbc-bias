We're resuming our live coverage of the Israel-Gaza war. If you're just joining us, here's what you need to know: Israel says their military has encircled the last Hamas strongholds in Jabaliya and Shejaiya in northern Gaza. Tanks have also moved towards the centre of the southern city of Khan Younis. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Hamas fighters have been surrendering to Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) and it is the "beginning of the end" for the group which has controlled Gaza for years. However, one military analyst speaking to the BBC described the claim as “wildly optimistic" The Kerem Shalom crossing between Israel and Gaza will open for aid inspections on Tuesday, Israel says, to "double" the volume of aid entering Gaza. Israel has told the hundreds of thousands of Gazans sheltering in Khan Younis to move to al-Mawasi but international aid organisations criticise the call, since the area is a small strip of land with no infrastructure to provide for basic human needs. The rest of the Gaza Strip is on the brink of a "total breakdown of civil order", the UN’s agency for Palestinian refugees says. The UK and the EU say they are planning to impose sanctions on Israelis responsible for violence against Palestinians in the West Bank. Violent attacks there, including fatal shootings of Palestinians by armed Jewish settlers, have risen sharply. Stay with us as my colleague Kelly Ng and I bring you the latest developments.
