As we've been reporting, Hamas has confirmed the death of one of its senior leaders, Saleh al-Arouri. The 57-year-old was deputy chairman of Hamas's political bureau and the founding commander of the Al-Qassam Brigades, the group's military wing. He was involved in a deal that saw more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners being released in exchange for an IDF corporal in 2011. Al-Arouri was also closely connected with Iran and the Hezbollah group in Lebanon - a Shia Muslim organisation which is designated a terrorist organisation by Western states, Israel, Gulf Arab countries and the Arab League. He joined Hamas in 1987, leading the Islamic student movement and helping establish the group's military presence in the West Bank. He had been based in Lebanon prior to his death. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
