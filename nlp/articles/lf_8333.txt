The negotiations between Hamas and Israel have suffered a very serious setback. Hamas has made it clear it will not agree to a partial release of hostages for a partial ceasefire. This puts the Israeli government in a very difficult position. They've said they think the best way to get the release of their hostages is through military pressure on Hamas and also by staging rescue operations. But that hasn’t really happened. Only one hostage has actually been rescued - Ori Megidish. The Israeli government is under huge pressure from the relatives of the some 130 hostages still held by Hamas in Gaza, with some telling them the strategy of force is not working. Hamas is putting pressure on Israel to stop the war altogether, but without any guarantee that the group is going to stop its armed actions. So the Israeli government is extremely reluctant to stop fighting until it feels it has completely degraded Hamas capability - and it hasn’t done that yet. This will be a huge disappointment for the people of Gaza who are desperate for this war to stop. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
