The mood in occupied East Jerusalem is sombre. Members of one Palestinian community told me, “there is no Eid”. Ilham, 35, lives a stone’s throw away from al-Aqsa mosque – the third holiest site in Islam, where it is believed Prophet Mohammed ascended to heaven. It is also sacred in Judaism and known as Temple Mount. "It's a spiritual gift," Ilham says. "Everyone envies me for it. They say to me, 'You're so lucky!'" The social worker is one of about 450 Afro-Palestinians, descendants of pilgrims from Chad, Nigeria, Senegal, and Sudan, who live in an enclave in part of the old city's Muslim quarter, that were once prisons used by the Ottomans before the British took control over Jerusalem in 1917. But Ilham tells me that there is no happiness this year. "We haven't decorated our homes; we have no visitors. Only the spiritual and ritualistic elements of Ramadan remain. " Members of the Afro-Palestinian community and the wider Palestinian community in Jerusalem say prayer in the past month has become a form of resistance and Eid is only being celebrated in name.
