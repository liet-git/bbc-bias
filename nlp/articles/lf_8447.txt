T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. A British politician with relatives in Gaza has told the BBC that there's a sniper shooting at people in the church compound where her family are sheltering in Gaza City. Layla Moran, who is a Liberal Democrat MP, said her Christian Palestinian relatives had sought refuge at the Catholic Holy Family Church after their home was bombed in the first week of the Israel-Gaza war. Moran said the situation for her family had been "deteriorating all week" but that things had escalated again "in the last 48 hours". "Now they are without water, without food and there is a sniper inside the compound," she added. Moran said her family and hundreds of other people sheltering at the church complex are trapped by the threat of shooting,  "As they try and leave their rooms. . . there is firing at them. " Moran added that the timing of the attacks, just a week away from Christmas Eve, were adding to the distress; "This is an incredibly important time for Christians and yet they're doing this to Christians in a church. " She told the BBC she doesn't know why this was happening and said; "Either the rules of engagement are being ignored or there is a plan to clear the whole of Gaza. " "My family are not justifiable collateral damage in this war," Moran added. You can read more about Moran's family's situation here . UK MP says family trapped in church complex amid sniper fire.
