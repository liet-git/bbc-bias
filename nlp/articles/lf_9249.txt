Since yesterday, we've been reporting that Israeli forces have encircled the home of Yahya Sinwar , the head of Hamas's political wing in Gaza - effectively second-in-command after leader Ismail Haniyeh. The IDF says he doesn't appear to be there. He's thought to be hiding in underground tunnels with bodyguards, communicating with no-one to avoid being tracked down. Israel holds him responsible, along with others, for the 7 October attacks, and  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insists "it's only a matter of time before we get him". Sinwar, 61, was born in Khan Younis after his parents were displaced from Ashkelon in what Palestinians call “al-Nakba” (the Catastrophe) – the mass displacement of Palestinians from their ancestral home in the war that followed Israel's founding in 1948. He was first arrested by Israel in 1982, aged 19, for "Islamic activities" and then arrested again in 1985. That's when he won the confidence of Hamas's founder, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, and started working his way up through the ranks. Read Frank Gardner's profile of Sinwar here. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
