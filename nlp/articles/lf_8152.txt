MPs are debating the new procedure now that the government has withdrawn its amendment. It comes after a passionate debate on the conflict - focusing mostly on the suffering in the Gaz Strip. Labour MP Fleur Anderson, however, stressed the pain of Israeli hostages. She says she has visited the area twice in the last six months, including a trip last week during during which she visited one of the Kibbutz attacked on 7 October, Jerusalem and the West Bank. She says she met the mother of one of the hostages. Her son had gone to the music festival on 6  October and the next morning texted his mother "I love you" and "I'm sorry". She hasn't heard from him since. "It's not a competition of pain and tears, it's just a bunch of pain and tears," the hostage's mother told Anderson. "We should learn from this, we should learn about solidarity both with the Jewish people and the Palestinian people and find words to say that here and across out country," Anderson says. She lists what needs to happen now: an immediate ceasefire, no attack on the 1.5 million in Rafah, the release of hostages, a freeze on demolition of Palestinian homes in the West Bank, and the international recognition of the state of Palestine. "The IDF have said they are planning 2024 to be the year of war - we are here today to say no," she concludes. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
