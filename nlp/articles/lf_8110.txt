The former British ambassador to Lebanon has told the BBC that yesterday's walkout was "not exactly Parliament's finest hour. " Tom Fletcher, who served as ambassador from 2011-2015 said there was too much focus on the parliamentary debate "as though it matters more than stopping the violence against civilians". Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Fletcher said he had been speaking to his contacts in the region who have been following what's been happening in the UK. "I met with the Lebanese prime minister earlier this week and clearly the Lebanese people do not want that conflict," he said. The Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah has been trading fire with Israel since war broke out, with civilians killed on both sides and thousands having to leave their homes. Fletcher added, "I think people are right to be worried about the dangers of escalation that could draw in more countries in the region. " He urged Parliament to "get back to the big issue of getting aid in" to Gaza and "to the faint hope of a two-state solution" to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
