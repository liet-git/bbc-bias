The mood in Israel is sombre as is to be expected six months after the 7 October attack lodged a deep new trauma within the country. But there's also urgency mixed with despair over the fate of the remaining hostages held in Gaza. This morning's front page in the leading Israeli newspaper, Haaretz, conveys this, with a stark headline, reading 'There is not another day' surrounded by the faces of the hostages. On Saturday night, Tel Aviv was once again the heart of protests demanding that the government do everything in its power to ensure that they are brought home safely. Those pleas have increasingly coalesced with demands for elections in an effort to remove the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from power. But the deep divisions within Israel that were on open display before 7 October - through months of demonstrations against government plans to curb judicial power - were also in evidence at the protest, as at one point a car rammed into protesters.
