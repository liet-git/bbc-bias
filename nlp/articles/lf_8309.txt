A meeting between Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant and US defence secretary Lloyd Austin is expected to go ahead later today, despite Israel's fury over the US's decision to abstain in a UN Security Council vote calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. Following the vote, which was passed on Monday evening, Israel cancelled a separate meeting between members of its delegation and US officials. The other meeting between Gallant and Austin, however, is going ahead. According to US reports, Gallant is expected to ask for more US weaponry and equipment to support Israel's war in Gaza - a request that is under intense scrutiny from US lawmakers.
