At the University of Texas in Austin, police on horseback descended on a large crowd of pro-Palestinian protestors gathered on the school’s campus. Images from the encounter between police and protestors show multiple people handcuffed, face down, some with police kneeling on them. A video went viral showing a local news cameraman being knocked to the ground by police. Texas Governor Greg Abbott said the protesters "belong in jail". The protest - launched on Wednesday morning by a university-affiliated student group - was quickly dispelled by the evening. The university’s president, Jay Hartzell, said demonstrators tried to “occupy” the campus, and broke university policies while ignoring multiple requests to leave. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
