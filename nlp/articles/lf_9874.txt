T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. There are more than 600,000 Israelis living in illegal settlements in the occupied West Bank and east Jerusalem - and Western powers are increasingly worried about the violence some are using to try to seize land from Palestinians. Ten days ago, the United States imposed sanctions on four settlers. The UK has now followed suit, targeting four Israelis whom the Foreign Office said had violently attacked Palestinians. The settlers – only one of whom was also on the US list - are accused of destroying Palestinian property and threatening families at gunpoint. They will be banned from travelling to Britain and any assets they have here will be frozen, complicating their links to Israeli banks exposed to UK financial markets. Lord Cameron said the men’s behaviour was illegal, unacceptable and an egregious abuse of human rights. He accused Israel of not following through on its commitments to tackle extremist behaviour. Settlers are a powerful force in Israeli politics and Benjamin Netanyahu’s government depends on their support. But Western powers fear their actions could trigger an escalation in the current conflict, and these sanctions are a warning that international patience is growing thin. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
