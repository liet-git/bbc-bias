It's coming up to 15:45 in Gaza and Israel, and 13:45 here in our London newsroom. Here are the main developments so far today: Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says at least 14 people were killed in an Israeli bombing in al-Mawasi in southern Gaza - an area Israel had previously designated as a safe zone. The Palestinian Red Crescent charity says its headquarters in Khan Younis has been hit in an Israeli strike, with one person killed and six others injured. In Lebanon, the funeral of assassinated deputy Hamas leader Saleh al-Arouri is getting under way in the capital Beirut. The Iran-backed Hezbollah group has said four more of its members have been killed in an Israeli air strike in the village of Naqoura in Lebanon. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is set to travel to the Middle East later - his fourth visit since 7 October. Global concerns about the regional spill over of the war in Gaza remain high. The UN Security Council says the attacks by Iran-backed Houthis on ships in the Red Sea threaten regional stability, freedom of navigation and global food supplies. The Houthis, who control much of Yemen, have been targeting ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden with missiles or drones. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
