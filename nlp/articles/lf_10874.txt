Today marks half a year since the deadly 7 October Hamas attacks in Israel. About 1,200 Israelis were killed and more than 250 others taken hostage during the attacks. An Israeli military campaign has followed, which has killed more than 33,000 Palestinians, mainly women and children, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. Here are some of the latest developments as the world reflects on the last six months: Israel's military says it has declined the number of forces in southern Gaza in order to regroup and conduct preparations for its next stage in the war. The US says Israel is likely trying to "rest and refit", and it is not necessarily indicative of any new operations. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says Israel is "one step away from victory" but adds there will be no ceasefire without the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas. A new round of truce talks are set to begin in Egypt later today. The World Food Programme has reiterated its warning of imminent famine in northern Gaza, and says children are dying of hunger. Mourners have been attending the memorial site for those killed during the Nova m usic festival in the 7 October Hamas attacks, near the border with Gaza, in southern Israel. UK Foreign Secretary Lord Cameron has called on Hamas to release the remaining hostages , saying it is "utterly inhumane" to extend families' agony. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
