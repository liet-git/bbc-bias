Away from the conflict in Gaza, the Israel Defence Forces says it's attacked a series of targets belonging to the Lebanese group Hezbollah - an Iran-backed Shia Islamist group that wields considerable military and political power in Lebanon. It is considered a terrorist organisation by Israel, UK, the US and others. The IDF says its air force struck "several terrorist infrastructures alongside military sites where the organisation's terrorists operated". Since Israel launched its offensive on Gaza following Hamas's attack on 7 October, Hezbollah has regularly carried out rocket and drone attacks from southern Lebanon, some aimed at military targets, others fired more indiscriminately into northern Israel. Israel has evacuated thousands of civilians from the area because of escalating hostilities with Hezbollah militants. Smoke rises following what the Israeli military says is an Israeli strike on Hezbollah targets in Lebanon. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
