We've been hearing from the Israeli leadership, and now we have some lines from Hamas. Any post-war arrangement in Gaza without Hamas is a "delusion", Ismail Haniyeh - who is widely considered the group's leader - warns in a televised address. "We are open to discuss any ideas or initiatives that could end the [Israeli] aggression and open the door for putting the Palestinian house in order both in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip," Haniyeh adds, in comments translated by the Reuters news agency. The Israeli government says one of its war aims is to fully eliminate Hamas. Hamas is proscribed as a terrorist organisation in many countries, including the US and UK. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
