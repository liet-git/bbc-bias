The Archbishop of Wales has called for an end to the "futile" war in Gaza. As part of his Easter message, Andrew John said he hoped the conflict could be resolved amid an escalating humanitarian crisis in the Middle East. "[I hope] that all involved find a way beyond it in which they can live together in mutual trust," he said. He added he wished for "a more inclusive, fairer" society and praised those who helped others in need during the cost of living crisis. Despite a "really depressing" backdrop of people in Wales continuing to struggle with higher costs of living, the archbishop said he was struck by the "good deeds" of volunteers running food banks and community events such as Parkrun.

"People who volunteer [have at their centre] not themselves but Jesus Christ and the service of their fellow human beings. "Inspired by him they do extraordinary things that very often go unrecognised and yet have the capacity to touch human life. "The message of Easter calls us to be transformed in our own lives, and for the benefit of others. "Following Vaughan Gething's recent election as the new first minister of Wales, and with a general election set to take place later this year, Mr John said: "My hope, prayer and plea to all [politicians] is to craft a vision for society which is more inclusive, fairer and just. "Where people are not left out or are on the side lines, but gathered up to become part of creating a society of which we can be proud. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
