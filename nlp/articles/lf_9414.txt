This week's show is under way and we're now hearing from the panel, who are discussing the situation in the Middle East. Here's who's in the studio with Laura: Nadhim Zahawi is currently the MP for Stratford-on-Avon and has been for 14 years. However, this week he announced that he would stand down at the next general election. He was sacked as Tory Party chairman by Rishi Sunak last January after failing to disclose that HMRC was investigating his tax affairs. Zarah Sultana , who has been the Labour MP for Coventry South since 2019, is also on the programme. Writer and magazine editor Tina Brown is also on air to provide insights having spent decades chronicling the Royal Family. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
