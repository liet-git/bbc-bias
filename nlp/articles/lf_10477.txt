Three-quarters of the 99 journalists and media workers killed in 2023 died during the Israel-Hamas conflict, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ). Seventy-two of the 99 fatalities were Palestinians killed during Israeli military operations in Gaza, while three Lebanese and two Israeli journalists also died. This equates to more than four journalists killed every week since the war began on 7 October 2023. CPJ executive officer Jodie Ginsburg says the loss of Palestinian journalists will have "long-term impacts for journalism not just in the Palestinian territories but for the region and beyond". "Every journalist killed is a further blow to our understanding of the world," she adds. Palestinian members of the press face huge risks when covering the war in Gaza. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
