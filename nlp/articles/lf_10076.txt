In a statement, President Joe Biden condemned the attack against Israel "in the strongest possible terms", and has said US aircraft and missile defence destroyers sent to the region had helped Israel repel the Iranian assault. No US forces were hit in the attack, said Biden, and the Israelis had managed to take down nearly all the incoming drones and missiles. Earlier in the day, the president cut short a weekend away in Delaware to hold urgent meetings with his National Security team at the White House. US and Israeli defence and security officials were in close contact as the Iranian attack unfolded. President Biden said he would now convene G7 leaders to coordinate a united diplomatic response. But this was a large-scale attack on Americaâ€™s most important ally in the Middle East, and pressure will now grow on the Biden administration over how to respond. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
