The part of Gaza where this incident took place - the north - has suffered widespread devastation since the fighting between Hamas and the Israeli military began in October. It was the focus of the first phase of Israel's ground offensive and has been largely cut off from humanitarian assistance for several months, despite some relief efforts by UN aid agencies who say that half of Gaza's population is starving and most people regularly go without food for a whole day. Last week, the World Food Programme said it had been forced to suspend aid deliveries to the area after its first convoy in three weeks was surrounded by crowds of hungry people close to the Israeli military's Wadi Gaza checkpoint, and then faced gunfire in Gaza City. Another convoy faced what it called "complete chaos and violence due to the collapse of civil order". T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
