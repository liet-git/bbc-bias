T-I-T-L-E-E-N-D.  T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. In the small West Bank village of Arura, hundreds of mourners had gathered since early this morning to mark the death of their most celebrated son. There would probably have been many more - men at a large hall in the lower part of the town and women up at the family home. But Israeli military roadblocks cut the village off temporarily from the much larger town of Ramallah. Saleh al-Arouri was raised and educated here, going on to become a senior Hamas leader and the founder of its military wing. Israel has not publicly acknowledged carrying out the drone missile strike that killed him and five other Hamas members in a Beirut suburb in retaliation for the 7 October attacks from Gaza. But none of the mourners were in any doubt over who was responsible. His sister, Fatima al-Arouri, said it was a decision Israel would come to regret. “His death will be a trigger, not just here in the West Bank but across the whole world,“ said Fatima. “The assassination will be felt across the region because he was not just ‘anyone’. They [Israel] have brought catastrophe upon themselves from all sides”. Israel and its allies regarded Arouri as a ruthless terrorist, responsible for organising many of Hamas’ deadliest operations. It was a description rejected by Arouri’s uncle,  Mustafa, as he welcomed the steady stream of male relatives, friends and civic leaders who came to pay their respects. “Israel holds itself up as a democratic state but, with what is happening now in Gaza, it has shown its real face to the world,” the uncle told me. “It is a criminal state, they want all Palestinians out but we will never be removed from history. ”.
