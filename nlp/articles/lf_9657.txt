T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Earlier, the UK's permanent representative to the UN, Barbara Woodward, called for the "implementation of the resolution to be immediate". Since then, she's added that Britain "regrets that the resolution did not condemn the terrorist attacks perpetrated by Hamas on 7 October". "Palestinians in Gaza are living through a humanitarian catastrophe. The situation will not improve until more aid can get in," she said. "The Council's message today is an important one and I reiterate we call for it to be implemented immediately. " The US has blamed its abstention on the fact the resolution failed to condemn Hamas - but White House national security spokesperson John Kirby added that it did "fairly reflect our view that a ceasefire and the release of hostages come together".
