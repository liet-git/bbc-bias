The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) is denying a claim made by Israel that the body is ignoring evidence that Hamas uses Gaza hospitals as shields. The allegation was made by Israeli Ambassador Meirav Eilon Shahar at a meeting of WHO's executive board on Thursday. "This is not incompetence; it is collusion," she said. In response, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that "such false claims are harmful and can endanger our staff who are risking their lives to serve the vulnerable". "As a United Nations agency, WHO is impartial and is working for the health and well-being of all people," he added. Israel has long maintained that Hamas uses hospitals in Gaza to hide its operation and has used this as one of its main justifications for its military operation there. In November the US said it had intelligence that Hamas had a command centre under Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City. Hamas denies these claims. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
