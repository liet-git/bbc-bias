Hello and welcome as we continue our live coverage of the war between Israel and Hamas. Israel's aerial bombardment has continued in the Gaza Strip, with strikes hitting the southern towns of Khan Younis, Deir al Balah and Rafah. This comes as Israel's military warned that it could be shifting towards "prolonged fighting" that could continue all year. On Monday, Israel's miliary said it was pulling some reservists out of Gaza in preparation for this. Stick with us as we take you through all the latest events. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
