We'll be pausing our coverage shortly, but before we go, let's take a look at some of the main developments from today: Negotiations continued in Cairo, Egypt, to broker a new truce and secure the release of more Israeli hostages . Hamas said Palestinian groups reject the prospect of more hostages being released until Israel agrees to end the war in Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the war in Gaza will not stop until Israel achieves all of its goals. Elsewhere, the World Health Organization said northern Gaza has been left without a functional hospital due to lack of fuel, staff and supplies. And the World Food Programme has warned Gaza faces a famine in the next six months if the conflict continues. We're also still waiting for the UN Security Council to vote on a draft resolution to pause hostilities in Gaza. The vote has been delayed multiple times this week as diplomats try to agree on language that will not end with the US vetoing the resolution. It's not yet known if there'll be a vote on the text tonight, but we will bring you the latest updates if there's movement at the UN headquarters in New York. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
