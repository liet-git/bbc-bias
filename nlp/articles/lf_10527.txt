On Monday, the Israeli military directed around 100,000 Palestinians in eastern Rafah to evacuate to an “expanded humanitarian area" - where it said they would find field hospitals, tents and basic supplies. Palestinians warned that the area was made up of neighbourhoods that were already overcrowded and lacking in essential services, were still coming under intense bombardment, or had been left in ruins by recent fighting. The UN said the evacuation zone covered more than 30 sq km (12 sq miles) and was home to nine sites sheltering displaced people, as well as three clinics and six warehouses. Flyers - dropped by Israeli aircraft - pointed them to a 60 sq km (23 sq miles) area stretching north along the Mediterranean coast from al-Mawasi - a narrow strip of agricultural land that has long been an IDF-designated “humanitarian zone” - to the city of Khan Younis and the central town of Deir al-Balah.
