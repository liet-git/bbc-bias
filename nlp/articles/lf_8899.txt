Hamas has criticised the UN Security Council resolution as an "insufficient step" to meet the humanitarian needs of people in Gaza. In a statement released a little while ago, the group - which is banned as a terrorist organisation in the UK, US and EU -  also called it a "weak formula" and accused the US of working hard to "empty this resolution of its essence". "[The resolution] defies the will of the international community and the United Nations General Assembly in stopping Israel's aggression against our defenceless Palestinian people," the statement says.
