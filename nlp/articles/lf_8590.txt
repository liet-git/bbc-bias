T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. We can bring you some more reaction from Hamas now, after an official earlier said that seeking arrest warrants for three Hamas leaders "equates the victim with the executioner". In a broader statement, the group reiterates these comments while saying that the application for warrants for Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant comes "seven months late". The statement adds: Hamas demands the Public Prosecutor to issue arrest and detention orders against all war criminals, including occupation leaders, officers, and soldiers who were involved in the crimes against the Palestinian people. It also demands the cancellation of all arrest warrants issued against leaders of the Palestinian resistance for violating UN conventions and resolutions. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
