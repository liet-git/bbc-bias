Let's give you the latest on the situation in southern Gaza from Louise Wateridge, who is in Rafah and has described the city this morning as "incredibly eerie". Wateridge, who is a representative for UN Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNWRA), says according to the latest UN figures, 300,000 people have fled the city. "Looking out today and having been around Rafah this morning, I think this number is much higher - it's emptied in the last 48 hours,” Wateridge tells BBC Radio 5 Live's Sunday Breakfast show. “In our shelters in Khan Yunis - an area that was completely destroyed - we are seeing families moving back there. They are moving into rubble, essentially. " Wateridge says classrooms are "completely torched out" but explains families and children have started to move back into these facilities. "I think that just speaks for the utter desperation of people not having anywhere to go,” she says. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
