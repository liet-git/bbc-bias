As we reported earlier, multiple aid organisations, including the UN in recent hours , have said that they will be pausing operations in Gaza after an attack on a charity convoy killed seven aid workers. This includes the World Central Kitchen, which had 68 kitchens across the enclave, along with the American Near East Refugee Aid (ANERA) and Project Hope, which provides healthcare aid. These announcements have sparked increasing concern about the disruption of aid in Gaza, which is on the brink of a famine. Half the population - about 1.1m people - are starving, according to the IPC classification. Before April, the UN's worst-case scenario estimated that the entire population will be in famine by July 2024. Gaza has the "highest share of people facing high levels of acute food insecurity that the IPC initiative has ever classified for any given area or country," the UN has said. Its most senior human rights official, Volker TÃ¼rk, told the BBC that Israel bore significant blame for the crisis in Gaza, and there was a "plausible" case that it was using starvation as a weapon of war . Israel has vehemently denied this. Read our full article about when a famine is declared here. Israel has been accused of limiting the flow of aid into Gaza, which is on the brink of famine.
