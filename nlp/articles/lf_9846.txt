The World Health Organization's Sean Casey, who is coordinating medical teams on the ground in Gaza, said he is deeply concerned about fighting around three hospitals - al-Aqsa Hospital, European Gaza Hospital and Nasser Hospital - which provide the "last line" of health care in the region. Speaking to Reuters, he warned "weâ€™re seeing the health system collapse at a very rapid pace". Casey continued: "What we continue to see is the health system suffering, health workers unable to go to their workplace to care for patients because they fear for their lives, they fear for their safety. "Patients who fear, and their families who fear, going to the hospital because they may die on the way. "And actually, I heard that this morning, because of hostilities around a hospital in Khan Yunis governorate [in the south of Gaza], that patients and their families are risking their lives to just seek care. " Hospitals in Gaza have been inundated with injured people and displaced families seeking shelter. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
