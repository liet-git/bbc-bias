T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. We are now briefly turning to the war in Gaza, the reason behind the university protests across the US. Sanabel is 16 years old and lives in Gaza City, she has lost about half her family members and most of her friends. She spoke to BBC OS radio a few times and she often shares how she came to terms with the possibility of dying, how she felt the world did not care about what was happening to her and how she had to stay strong and positive for her little sister. Today, she talked to us on how she felt about the protests on US campuses: When I hear about these demonstrations it makes me feel better, thank you from the bottom of my heart. I feel there are a lot of people with us now and my voice is getting heard and the humanity unites us. I feel like my fear about being forgotten by the world disappears and I hope this war ends soon, thanks a bunch. Sanabel is 16 years old and she lives in Gaza City. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
