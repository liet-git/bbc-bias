As we've been reporting, residents in Rafah woke up to new warnings this morning, as the Israeli army called on more neighbourhoods in the city to evacuate to the western parts of the Gaza Strip. Here's a little bit more information from the Israel Defense Forces’ spokesperson, Avichay Adraee, who wrote on X in Arabic earlier ordering people to leave for the “expanded humanitarian area” in al-Mawasi “immediately”. He says Hamas is trying to rebuild its capabilities in the region and says the IDF will work with great force against them. Adraee says everyone in those areas, and their families, are exposed to danger. Last week the IDF had already ordered tens of thousands of civilians to begin evacuating eastern parts of Rafah city, ahead of what it called a "limited" operation to eliminate Hamas fighters and dismantle infrastructure.
