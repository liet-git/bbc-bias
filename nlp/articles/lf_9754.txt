Israel says it will open or expand three crossings into Gaza to increase humanitarian aid, after US President Joe Biden told Israel it must take steps to protect civilians if it wants to keep US support. The Erez Gate in northern Gaza will be temporarily re-opened and Ashdod Port will also be opened for aid deliveries. More aid from Jordan will be allowed to enter via the Kerem Shalom Crossing. The move to open Israel's northern border crossing with Gaza in Erez is particularly significant , after Israel's Foreign Minister Eli Cohen told Israeli media in November that there would be "no more contact between Israel and Gaza" Israel's announcement came just hours after Biden spoke to Netanyahu for the first time since an Israeli strike killed seven aid workers in Gaza on Monday. It is understood that the re-opening of the corridors was specifically requested by Biden in the phone call. It was the first time that Washington attempted to leverage American aid in order to influence the conduct of the war in Gaza - marking a significant shift in US policy. The US National Security Council welcomed Israel’s decision and said these steps “must now be fully and rapidly implemented”. US policy, it added, would be determined by the steps Israel took to protect "innocent civilians and the safety of aid workers" US says Israel must make changes in Gaza in 'hours and days' T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
