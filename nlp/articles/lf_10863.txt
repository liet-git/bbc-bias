That BBC interview with Mark Regev mentioned safe zones - which gives us a chance to recap what's been happening in one of these. As Israel presses its military offensive across Gaza, it's has been repeatedly advising some two million civilians to move to a "humanitarian zone", al-Mawasi. It's just 8.5 sq km (3.3 sq miles), which is smaller than London's Heathrow Airport. Al-Mawasi is a narrow strip of land by the Mediterranean Sea. It has few buildings and largely consists of sandy dunes and agricultural land. Reem Abd Rabu has spent weeks sleeping on the ground and sharing a tent with four other families in the area of al-Mawasi, thinking it would be safe from the intense bombardment and fighting. But she found little to no basic services when she arrived. Reem told the BBC al-Mawasi was an abandoned place, "not a place for human beings".
