A 46-truck convoy has carried over 750 metric tons of food into Gaza today - the first time a direct aid convoy from Jordan has reached the Strip since hostilities began. So far, aid deliveries have only been possible via Egypt. The convoy is organised by the UN's World Food Programme (WFP ) and the Jordan Hashemite Charity Organization, and travelled through the Kerem Shalom crossing between Israel and Gaza. WFP says half of the population in Gaza is now starving and calls for an immediate ceasefire and the opening of all border crossings. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
