Three British aid workers killed during an Israeli air strike on Gaza died from blast injuries, an inquest has heard. James Kirby, 47, from Street in Somerset, James Henderson, 33, from Falmouth in Cornwall and John Chapman, 57, from Poole in Dorset, died on 1 April. An inquest into their deaths was opened at Avon Coroner's Court in Flax Bourton, near Bristol, earlier. It heard that initial post-mortem results found all three men died from injuries to their head, chest and limbs. The inquest has been adjourned until later this year. Mr Kirby, who was born in Bristol, was one of seven World Central Kitchen (WCK) workers who died while travelling with a convoy leaving a warehouse in Deir al-Balah, south of Gaza City. Emotional tributes were paid to him on Saturday during a fundraising event held for his family. As well as the three Britons, Australian national Lalzawmi Frankcom, Polish national Damian Sobol, Palestinian Saifeddin Issam Ayad Abutahas and US-Canadian citizen Jacob Flickinger, were also killed.
