T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. We've been reporting deadly overnight strikes in the city of Rafah. The city is situated in the south of the Gaza Strip, where more than a million displaced Palestinians have found shelter after fleeing the fighting in the north. Now, Israel says it will expand its military operations all the way to the south - with heavy aerial bombardment reported in the Gaza area. A ground invasion in the refugee-packed area could prove disastrous and the US has warned Israel not to attack without a “credible” plan to protect civilians. International journalists are not allowed into Gaza. Our International editor Jeremy Bowen reports from the wall separating Bethlehem in the West Bank from Israeli-controlled Jerusalem: Bowen: Gazans fled to Rafah for safety but now Israel wants to attack.
