T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Amid calls from the US for Israel to protect civilians in Gaza, people in the southern city of Khan Younis have been telling us that they don’t trust or understand current measures. In comments yesterday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said there was “a gap between… the intent to protect civilians and the actual results that we're seeing on the ground”, and that talks on the matter between the US and Israel were happening on a regular basis. Israel says it takes measures including calling civilians ahead of strikes and distributing leaflets, and recently launched a digital map dividing the Gaza Strip into hundreds of zones that it said would help to direct people to safer areas. But Gaza resident Tariq Dahlan says there is currently “no safe place” in Gaza, and that he believes the Israeli army only publishes such maps to shield itself from international criticism as civilians are killed. He sought shelter in Khan Younis after Gaza’s residents were ordered to move south for safety but says there is “no security in the city”, which Israeli tanks and troops have now entered. Tariq adds that internet connection remains “very weak” so accessing any information online is difficult. “The squares are incomprehensible and the maps cannot be understood,” he says. Another Gaza resident, Ahmad al Battah, agrees, saying “nowhere in Gaza is safe” and the grid map is “not clear”. Tariq Dahlan, who escaped Gaza City to Khan Younis, says there is currently “no safe place” in Gaza. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
