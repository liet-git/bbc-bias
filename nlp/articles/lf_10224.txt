The United Nations has issued a statement warning the "tragic consequences of this conflict will be disproportionately borne by women and girls for generations". “Pregnant women, along with young children, older persons and persons with disabilities, are at higher risk of communicable diseases, malnutrition and death, all of which become increasingly likely as Gaza’s civilian infrastructure collapses", the statement says. The UN says the interruption to housing, school and healthcare will destroy the future of young girls in Gaza, which it describes as "already fragile". Regarding reports of sexual violence by Hamas, the UN adds that these must be investigated and people responsible "must be held accountable". Witnesses have told the BBC that there were "multiple signs of sexual assault" on the bodies of those attacked on 7 October. Palestinians  in Deir al Balah, Gaza on Thursday. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
