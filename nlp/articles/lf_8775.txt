The director of planning for the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), Sam Rose, has been speaking to the BBC's Today programme from Rafah about the air strike that killed scores of Palestinians on Sunday. At least 45 people were killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, while hundreds more have been treated for severe burns, fractures and shrapnel wounds. Rose says there were around eight strikes on a camp and that many were killed in fires as a result. He has heard reports of "horrific shrapnel injuries”. Rose raises Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu's initial description of the strike as a "mishap". “We cannot dismiss this as a simple accident. Women and children were killed in the most gruesome, the most brutal, of circumstances," he says. The situation in Gaza is reaching “new depths of horror and bloodshed and brutality every single day", he says. “If this isn’t a wake up call" for the international community, "it’s hard to see what will be", he adds.
