T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. The charity ActionAid says that children are being hit hardest by the situation in Gaza, as thousands of people are forced to live in makeshift shelters or sleep rough. We've been reporting today on the heavy rains that have compounded problems in the area. Riham Jafari, from the charity, says "those who were already hungry, thirsty, exhausted and terrified are now wet and cold too". "As conditions become ever harsher, it is children who will suffer the most. " A mother, who is sheltering in a camp in southern Gaza, tells the charity she is struggling to feed her children. "Honestly, food and water are not even our concern. We just want our children to be safe," she says. Children warm up round a fire outside a makeshift tent in Rafah. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
