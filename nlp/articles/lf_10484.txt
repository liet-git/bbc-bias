If you’re just joining us, we've been covering the scene at Nasser hospital in southern Gaza where Israel's special forces have carried out a raid. Here are the latest developments so far: Special forces entered the hospital and began what Israel describes as a "precise and limited mission" The IDF says the aim is to find and return bodies of hostages it believes are hidden inside the medical complex. This information, the IDF says, is based on its own “credible evidence”. Chaotic scenes are being reported from inside and around the hospital, where many displaced people are said to be sheltering. Hamas rejects the IDF’s accusations , saying claims about hostages being held inside Nasser are "lies" Intensive care patients are reportedly in “grave danger” , according to the Hamas-run health ministry. But the IDF says "there is no obligation for patients or staff to evacuate" This morning’s raid comes amid warnings from heads of aid agencies, who made impassioned appeals to UN member states to do their utmost to prevent an Israeli ground operation in Rafah , the border city 7km (4.5 miles) from Nasser. There are estimated to be more than 1.4 million people sheltering inside Rafah - prior to the 7 October attack it held a population of 250,000. Inside Nasser hospital as Israeli forces launch raid.
