T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Let's bring you some comments from the Israeli foreign minister who has spoken following the UN General Assembly's overwhelming support for a non-binding resolution demanding a ceasefire in Gaza. It left Israel looking increasingly isolated and was followed by US President Joe Biden issuing his sharpest criticism of Israel's leadership - directly linking the loss of international support with what he called the indiscriminate bombing of Palestinians. Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen has responded saying the war will continue "with or without international support". He adds: A ceasefire at the current stage is a gift to the terrorist organisation Hamas, and will allow it to return and threaten the residents of Israel. " Eli Cohen. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
