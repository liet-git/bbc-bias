A parade and rally, calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, took place in Belfast city centre on Saturday afternoon. Protesters left Writers Square and marched through the city centre to Belfast City Hall. It was organised by Gaels Against Genocide, which is supported by some of the best known names in the Gaelic Athletics Association (GAA). Flags from counties and GAA clubs across Ireland were flying, and speeches were made in front of the City Hall. A number of pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli demonstrations have been held in Belfast since the violence started. The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza to destroy the Hamas group in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 38,295 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Its figures do not differentiate between civilians and combatants, but it had reportedly identified 14,680 children, women and elderly people among the dead by the end of April.
