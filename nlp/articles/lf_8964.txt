More from the shadow foreign secretary, who is asked about the Labour government in the early 2000s finding itself under pressure to publish legal advice regarding the Iraq war. Laura says Lammy, currently aged 51, voted against publishing that legal advice and she then asks if Lammy has double-standards now calling for the UK government to release details relating to Israel. "You said as a young MP," Lammy jokes, adding "I am not so young anymore". "One learns from that experience. "You are asking me something which happened 20 years ago. It is the now which matters," Lammy says as he again calls for Lord Cameron to come to the House of Commons to face questions from MPs.
