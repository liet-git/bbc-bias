US President Joe Biden has issued his sharpest criticism yet of Israel's leadership, linking the loss of international support with what he called the indiscriminate bombing in Gaza. His comments were made to donors at a fundraising event on Tuesday. "Israel's security can rest on the United States, but right now it has more than the United States. It has the European Union, it has Europe, it has most of the world," he told donors to his 2024 re-election campaign in Washington. "But they're starting to lose that support by indiscriminate bombing that takes place," he said. You can read more about Joe Biden's comments here. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
