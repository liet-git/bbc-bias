Palestinians are continuing to return to Khan Younis, searching for their homes in the rubble, after Israeli troops left the southern Gaza city. As we try to ascertain the number of people returning there, here are some of today's key news lines: Israel has said the withdrawal of troops does not mean the war is over. Lt Col Peter Lerner told the BBC that Israel's military mission in the immediate area may be complete but "there are more operations that need to be conducted" elsewhere in the Strip. Palestinians, speaking to BBC Arabic, have described Khan Younis as having suffered "complete destruction" saying there is "hardly anything left" of the city. Meanwhile, truce talks between Israel and Hamas appear to have stalled, with unnamed Israeli and Hamas officials telling various news outlets no agreement has been reached so far. International pressure for a ceasefire is mounting, particularly after seven aid workers were killed in Gaza last week by an Israeli strike. US President Joe Biden has said Israel must make changes in how the war is being waged to avoid civilian deaths. Meanwhile, the Israeli military announced on Monday that it has successfully "eliminated" a senior Hezbollah commander in an air strike on southern Lebanon. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
