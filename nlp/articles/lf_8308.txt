More on ceasefire negotiations now. Further to the Israeli prime minister's office, which has accused Hamas of proposing "delusional" demands in relation to ceasefire negotiations, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz has also decried Hamas's calls for a more permanent ceasefire following Monday's UN Security Council vote . Katz told Israeli radio network Army Radio on Tuesday that the UN resolution - calling for an immediate ceasefire and the release of Israeli hostages - had served to embolden Hamas by signalling to the group, which controls Gaza, that international pressure would end the war without it having to make any concessions. The message that has been delivered is that "Hamas does not need to rush", Katz said in quotes cited by the Times of Israel. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
