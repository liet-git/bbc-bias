Lisa Nandy, Labour's shadow secretary for international development, says she recognises that her party's position on Gaza - now calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire - has changed a lot in just a few days. “It is a significant step and not one we’ve taken lightly,” she told Radio 4’s Today programme this morning. She explained what led to the party reconsidering its stance, saying: “In November, there was every reason to believe that what was achievable was a humanitarian pause to get aid in, hostages out and to create the space to begin negotiations towards a sustainable ceasefire. “But what has changed since then is that the humanitarian situation in Gaza has collapsed, the military efforts to rescue the hostages have largely failed and there are growing concerns about the deterioration of the health of the remaining hostages, and a ground invasion of Rafah is imminent. ”. She added that the change in language reflected that of the UK’s Five Eyes allies - Australia, Canada and New Zealand. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
