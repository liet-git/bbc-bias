T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Today's Gaza debate comes after a cross-party group of MPs returned from a visit to Al-Arish, an aid hub in Egypt, around 45km (28 miles) from the tightly controlled Rafah crossing into Gaza. Members of the International Development Committee also visited a large hospital caring for injured Palestinians. The committee chair, Labour MP Sarah Champion, says “nothing that has been reported braces you for the true scale of the horror in Gaza". “Politicians around the world need to demand an immediate end to the violence, full access for aid and a long term strategy to rebuild Gaza; both its infrastructure and its society,” she said.
