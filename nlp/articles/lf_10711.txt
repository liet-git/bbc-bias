We'd earlier reported on a Doctors Without Borders (MSF) surgeon who was shot inside northern Gaza's Al-Awda hospital on Monday. Here's more from MSF, which has tweeted about the incident in the last few hours. Snipers had surrounded the hospital and fired on those inside, the organisation said, adding that the hospital has been under "total siege" by Israeli forces since 5 December. “Reports coming out of Al-Awda hospital are harrowing and we are gravely worried for safety of patients and staff inside,” MSF's head of mission Renzo Fricke said on X, formerly known as Twitter. “Let us be clear: Al-Awda is a functioning hospital with medical staff and many patients in vulnerable condition. Targeting medical workers as they care for their patients is utterly reprehensible, utterly inhumane. ”. MSF also said Al-Awda and other hospitals in the north have sustained substantial damage and supplies are running low, further compromising doctors' capacity to treat their patients. At least five hospital staff, including 25 MSF doctors, have been killed since 7 October, the organisation added. Israeli military has accused Hamas of operating from medical facilities like hospitals - a claim the Palestinian group has denied. File photo of surgeons operating in Al-Awda on 30 November.
