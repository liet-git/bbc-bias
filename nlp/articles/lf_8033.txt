The foreign editor of the British newspaper Jewish News says he believes there will be a mixed reception from Israel's leaders to the latest visit by the US Secretary of State. Speaking to BBC News, Jotam Confino, says he thinks Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu may not be comfortable meeting Antony Blinken. Confino believes the US will be trying to steer Israel's leader away from carrying out an extensive  ground offensive in Rafah and trying to appeal to more moderate figures in the government such as Israeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz. He also suggests the US will want to discuss ceasefire negotiations in Qatar because "after all a ceasefire is best reached through direct negotiations or indirect negotiations and not through a UN Security Council resolution". He believes both Netanyahu and Hamas seem to have an interest in prolonging the war, adding that the PM wants to protect his position and Hamas hopes international support for Israel will fade which could force them to stop the war.
