Former Nato analyst Dr Patrick Bury has been speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live about Iran's drone and missile attacks on Israel on Saturday. Israel normally responds to its security issues by saying, “we need to be tough", Bury says. "Their thinking is this is an act of war," he says, adding that Israel probably doesn't "know themselves yet" how they'll respond. Bury says he “doesn’t know” how Israel could respond but adds that a "cyber attack, covert-action [or] assassinations” have been methods used by Israel in the past. Bury also says there has been a widening chasm between Israel and the US over the Gaza war, and the attack by Iran, is a "win win" for Israel as it has "forced the US back into the Israeli orbit more".
