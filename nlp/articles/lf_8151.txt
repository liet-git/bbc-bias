Labour MP Helen Hayes also recounted her recent visit to Israel, where she met both sides, which she said was a "distressing, moving and humbling experience". She spoke to a young man called Yottam, whose parents had been abducted and murdered by Hamas, at the Kibbutz Beeri. "As we stood outside the rubble of Yottam home he said 'vengeance is a valid feeling, it is not a valid policy," she said, urging MPs to set aside their own differences to secure peace.
