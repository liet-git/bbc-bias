T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. After the short flight from Cairo, we hit the tarmac in Tel Aviv in a US Air Force C-17. The welcome flags were out for Antony Blinken but like the hulking grey military plane we arrived in, the day is likely to be stripped of the usual fuss and niceties. He’s now heading to the Ministry of Defence where he’ll meet with Prime Minister Netanyahu and the Israeli war cabinet. They’ll talk about progress towards the ceasefire-for-hostage-release deal on the table with Hamas. Blinken says the gap is narrowing but still no breakthrough seems imminent.   That work’s being done in Doha. The main thing Blinken will want to leave Tel Aviv with is a sense the US can actually get Netanyahu to listen. The US-Israel relationship is now under significant stress. Washington wants aid poured into Gaza amid UN warnings of an imminent famine. And they don’t want a ground assault on Rafah. But they face an Israeli leader who so far has been prepared to publicly defy their requests, saying his prioity is acting for Israelis. Antony Blinken disembarks from an aircraft as he arrives in Israel. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
