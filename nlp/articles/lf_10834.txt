Speaking from Tel Aviv, Amir Avivi tells BBC Newsday the conflict could go on for another two months. "We are now in a crucial moment," he says. "More and more terrorists are surrendering. "Within a week or two the IDF will get full control of the northern part of the Gaza Strip. "It is a very dense area, a stronghold of Hamas, but geographically this is only 20% of the Gaza Strip. "But, it is an important achievement. " Elsewhere in Gaza, Avivi describes "fierce fighting" around Khan Younis to the south and insists Israel is "liberating Gaza from Hamas".
