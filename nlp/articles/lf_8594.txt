We can bring you some more reaction now to the ICC's announcement. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala calls the decision by prosecutor Karim Khan "appalling and completely unacceptable". "We must not forget that it was Hamas that attacked Israel in October and killed, injured and kidnapped thousands of innocent people. It was this completely unprovoked terrorist attack that led to the current war in Gaza and the suffering of civilians in Gaza, Israel and Lebanon," he says on X. But Belgian Foreign Minister Hadja Lahbib welcomes the move, saying Belgium supports the ICC. "Crimes committed in Gaza must be prosecuted at the highest level, regardless of the perpetrators. The request submitted by the courtâ€™s prosecutor, Karim Khan, for arrest warrants against both Hamas and Israeli officials is an important step in the investigation of the situation in Palestine," she says.
