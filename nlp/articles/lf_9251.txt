In what is my third day in the southern city of Rafah, after fleeing Khan Younis with the BBC team, I can still see tens of thousands of Palestinians continue to stream into the city. Streets here are packed with newly displaced people, and ambulances are seen rushing with the wounded trying to reach hospitals through the jammed streets. Water shortages are severe, and people carry empty yellow and blue jerrycans hoping to fill them at any opportunity. There is also no food or electricity, the supermarkets are empty. There is no internet at all, and no humanitarian aid is being delivered. Thousands have tried to go to UNRWA schools to find shelter, but as there was no place for them, they were forced to sleep on the ground in front of the schools. Others have gone to medical centres. The weather is very cold, and yesterday it was raining slightly. People are sleeping on the ground in light clothes. Some had to go to markets that sell second-hand clothes to buy warmer clothes for winter. Being one of the tens of thousands who has been displaced to Rafah, I am now writing from inside a makeshift tent set up by fellow journalists, in front of the Kuwaiti Specialised Hospital in the city. I would say this is our second journey of homelessness. We are still struggling to work through these difficult times while trying to understand what is happening around us. We cannot think of the extent this war will reach. The situation has gone far beyond imagination. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
