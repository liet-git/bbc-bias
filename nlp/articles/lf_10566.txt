T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen says Washington expects to hit Iran with new sanctions "in the coming days" following its unprecedented attack on Israel last weekend. Yellen says Iran's oil exports "remain in focus as a possible area" they could address, adding that Iran's actions threaten stability in the Middle East. "From this weekend's attack to the Houthi attacks in the Red Sea, Iran's actions threaten the region's stability and could cause economic spillovers," she warned. Speaking from Washington, Yellen said the Treasury would use its sanctions authority and work with allies to "continue disrupting the Iranian regime's malign and destabilising activity". Her remarks follow Israel's demand for sanctions on Iran's missile project. According to the Treasury Department, the US is already using financial sanctions to isolate Iran and disrupt its ability to fund proxy groups and support Russia's war in Ukraine. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
