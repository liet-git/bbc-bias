It's 22:00 in London and midnight in the Middle East where there's been a flurry of events in recent hours  – here’s a recap of the latest developments: Israeli forces attacked Hamas targets in Rafah, the group's last Gaza stronghold, and told residents  and refugees to leave "specific areas" and move to a new "humanitarian" camp. The IDF said it was conducting "targeted strikes" against Hamas in the eastern part of the city. The armed Palestinian Islamic Jihad faction, which operates alongside Hamas, fired rockets at southern Israel soon after reports of Israeli operations in Rafah. Tonight's escalation came after Hamas said it had approved a ceasefire proposal put forward by Qatari and Egyptian mediators. The details of the agreement are unclear and Israel's PM Benjamin Netanyahu said it was “far from meeting Israel's demands” . Israel will send a delegation to Cairo to negotiate further. The ceasefire proposal agreed by Hamas is thought to include release of Israeli hostages and return of displaced Palestinians within Gaza. John Kirby, the White House national security spokesman, said the talks between Israel and Hamas were at a "critical" stage : "I don't know that it gets any more sensitive than right now," he said.
