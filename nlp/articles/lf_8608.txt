Away from Lebanon, some of Israel's allies have denounced a series of recent comments by Israeli cabinet ministers calling for the resettlement of Palestinians outside of Gaza. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a member of the hard-right Religious Zionism party, has called for almost the entire Palestinian population of Gaza to leave the strip through "emigration", making way for Israeli settlers. Itamar Ben-Gvir, Israel's national security minister from the far-right Otzma Yehudit (Jewish Power) party, echoed his thoughts by claiming Israel should be "encouraging the residents of Gaza to emigrate". The official Israeli government stance is that Gazans will be able to return to their homes after the war. In response, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the pair were "slandering the Palestinian population". "Forced displacements are strictly prohibited as a grave violation of [international humanitarian law] and words matter," the diplomat writes on social media. Earlier a US official described the statements as "inflammatory and irresponsible". State department spokesman Matthew Miller said: "Gaza is Palestinian land and will remain Palestinian land, with Hamas no longer in control of its future and with no terror groups able to threaten Israel. " Ben-Gvir hit back at the US, saying: "Really appreciate the United States of America but with all due respect we are not another star on the American flag. " Smotrich (R) and Ben-Gvir are known for making inflammatory statements. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
