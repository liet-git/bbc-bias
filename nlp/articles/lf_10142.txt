Hezbollah, the powerful Iranian-backed Lebanese movement, and the Israeli military have been exchanging fire almost every day along the Lebanon-Israel border, fuelling fears of a major confrontation. So far, the violence has been largely contained to border areas. Hezbollah has calibrated its actions to prevent a full-scale war with Israel, which has warned of a destructive response. Last week, reacting to a suspected Israeli attack that killed a senior Hamas official in Hezbollah’s stronghold in Beirut, leader Hassan Nasrallah warned Israeli authorities against starting a conflict, saying they would regret it. But, crucially, there was no threat to escalate its actions. Many here still remember the destruction caused by the month-long conflict between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006 and, with Lebanon suffering a massive economic crisis, there is no public support for any military confrontation. Miscalculation, however, is always a risk. And, in Israel, some senior figures have defended a larger offensive against Hezbollah to reduce the threat posed by the group and allow the return of thousands of residents who have been evacuated because of constant attacks. “We’ll create a completely different reality [in the north],” the Israeli military’s chief of staff, Lt Gen Herzl Halevi said on Sunday, “or we’ll get to another war”.
