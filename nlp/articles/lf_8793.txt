BBC Arabic has been speaking with people in Gaza who have been displaced by the fighting. They include Khaled, who says he has been forced to move at least six times since the war began. “There is not a single place that is safe,” he explains, adding that there is no water or food available, or gas for cooking. Even those with money cannot use it, he says, because of the lack of availability of every day items. “Those who don’t die from the war are doomed to die from the inexistence of life’s essentials. The situation is catastrophic,” he says. Another man says he has been displaced four times, and was among those forced to leave northern Gaza near the start of the war. He is now staying at the European Hospital in Khan Younis, where he says people are suffering from starvation. “The prices here are very high and the people don’t even have the money to buy anything,” he says.
