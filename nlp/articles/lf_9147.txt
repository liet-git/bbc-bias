The commander of the air defence system in Isfahan - where the reported strike is said to have hit - has told state-controlled Iranian TV that an attack was thwarted earlier today. "The sound that was heard this morning in Isfahan was not an explosion," says Siavash Mihandoost. "It was the firing of the rockets of the powerful air defence systems at an object. " The incident has caused no damage, Mihandoost claims. Iran has downplayed the reports of a missile strike on the country, but Mihandoost says the air defence system is "prepared and ready" to confront anyone "that threatens the land or air" of Iran.
