The US is "actively working" on a UN draft resolution to pause fighting in Gaza, US National Security Council Coordinator John Kirby says. The UN Security Council could potentially hold a vote on the resolution in the next few hours. It has already been delayed multiple times this week. Diplomatic negotiations are taking place over the wording of the resolution to avoid another US veto, with the main sticking point reported to be around the inspection and monitoring of humanitarian aid entering Gaza. "We're still actively working with our UN partners about the resolution and on the language itself," National Security Council spokesman John Kirby just told reporters in the daily White House press briefing.
