We're pausing our live coverage for this evening, on a day when the US has vetoed a UN Security Council resolution calling for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza. Thirteen of the council's 15 members supported the motion. The UK abstained. The US, which can veto any resolution as one of five permanent members of the security council, said the proposal tabled by the United Arab Emirates was "imbalanced" and unrealistic. It criticised the resolution for failing to condemn the 7 October Hamas attacks that killed around 1,200 Israelis. "This resolution essentially says that Israel should just tolerate this, that it should allow this terror to go unchecked," the US representative said. But the State of Palestine said the veto was "beyond regrettable", adding that "millions of Palestinian lives hang in the balance. Every single one of them is sacred, worth saving". Earlier, Hamas officials in Gaza said Israel had killed more than 17,177 people in its campaign, and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has urged Israel to do more to protect civilians, saying there is a "gap" between its promises and the reality on the ground. Meanwhile, a 22-year-old Palestinian has told the BBC how he was detained with dozens of others by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in northern Gaza on Thursday. The man says he was forced to sit in the street for hours, handcuffed and blindfolded, before being driven away. An Israeli official said the soldiers were searching for Hamas members. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
