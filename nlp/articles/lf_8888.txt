It's just past 06:30 in Israel and Gaza, and 12:30 in Singapore. The war between Israel and Hamas has now passed the two-month mark. Here's a quick look at what happened in the past 24 hours: UN Humanitarian Chief Martin Griffiths has said that Israel's military offensive has meant there is " no place safe left for civilians anymore in southern Gaza ", calling it a "repeat of the assault in northern Gaza" He added that it also meant the UN had " no humanitarian operation . . . that can be called by that name anymore", saying that their aid programme had become "erratic, undependable and not sustainable" Tens of thousands of Palestinians have fled to Rafah near the border with Egypt as intense fighting continues in Khan Younis. Israel says that it will open the Kerem Shalom borde r crossing in the next few days to allow aid into Gaza. It has been closed since the war began. Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October, killing 1,200 people and taking 240 hostages , some of whom were released during a short-lived truce. Hamas officials in Gaza say Israel has killed more than 17,177 people in its retaliatory campaign, including about 7,000 children. Stay with us as we bring you more updates throughout the day.
