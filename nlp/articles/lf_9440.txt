T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. In the past few hours, several videos from central Gaza have emerged showing wounded Palestinians lying on the streets or in hospital. One such clip, which we have geolocated to a southern area of Nuseirat camp, shows scenes of total chaos as the camera tracks across several people exhibiting major injuries, some of whom are lying motionless on the ground. Other videos show what appear to be air strikes taking place in the same area. BBC Verify is working through all footage to gain a better understanding of what has happened. Numerous graphic videos have emerged on social media channels. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
