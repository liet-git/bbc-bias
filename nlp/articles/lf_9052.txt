Police have reached the main protest site and are attempting to dismantle the makeshift barricades. Weâ€™re watching police now breaking down barrier right behind us from the quad side of the encampments. There are fireworks going off one after the other. The police appear to be through some of the plywood barriers protesters had set up. They are starting to remove protesters who vowed to stay despite warnings. Police are asking us to clear a path as we watch someone escorted through in handcuffs. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
