Sullivan, speaking in Israel before he travels to the West Bank to meet the Palestinian Authority President, Mahmoud Abbas, reiterated the US view that the Authority needs to adapt and respond to the changing situation. "We do believe that the Palestinian Authority needs to be revamped and revitalised, needs to be updated in terms of its method of governance, its representation of the Palestinian people," he said. "And that will require a lot of work by everybody who is engaged in the Palestinian Authority, starting with the (Palestinian) president. " He said it will ultimately be up to the Palestinian people to work through their representation, and it will be up to leaders of the Palestinian Authority to work through the "types of steps that they need to take to reform and update the Authority for the situation we face today".
