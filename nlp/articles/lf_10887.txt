The Israeli military's regrouping of its troops in southern Gaza appears to be a "rest and refit" move, and is not necessarily indicative of any new operations, White House national security spokesman John Kirby says. Asked about the reduction in troops in an interview with ABC News, Kirby says Israeli troops have been on the ground for months and the understanding is that they are getting tired. He adds that it's hard to know exactly what the IDF move tells us. Earlier, an Israeli military official told the BBC that Israel had reduced the number of its forces in southern Gaza as it prepares for further operations.
