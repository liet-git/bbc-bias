A senior UN aid official has given an updated indication as to how bad the food and aid issues are in Gaza. Deputy director of the UN World Food Programme (WFP) Carl Skau warns that nine out of 10 people in the Palestinian territory canâ€™t eat every day - and that half the population is starving. In an interview with Reuters, he says nothing had prepared him for the fear, chaos and despair he encountered on visiting Gaza. As intense fighting continues across the territory, Skau insists only a fraction of the food supplies needed are coming in. He adds that conditions on the ground are making deliveries almost impossible. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
