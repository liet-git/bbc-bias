The UK's foreign secretary has urged Israel to "stop and think seriously" about any ground offensive in Rafah and the impact on the estimated 1.5 million people sheltering in the southern city. "There's nowhere for them to go," Lord David Cameron told reporters. "They can't go south into Egypt. They can't go north and back to their homes because many have been destroyed. "So we are very concerned about the situation and we want Israel to stop and think seriously before it takes any further action. " Cameron reiterated his call for a pause in the fighting, with the long-term aim of securing a "sustainable ceasefire". He added than any pause in fighting would allow for more aid to enter the territory, and for Israeli hostages to be rescued. "We need to get those hostages out, including the British nationals. We need to get the aid in," he said. "The best way to do that is to stop the fighting now and turn that into a permanent, sustainable ceasefire. ‚Äù. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
