The 44-year-old was from Melbourne and had been working with the World Central Kitchen. In a statement, Albanese said: "This is someone who was volunteering overseas to provide aid through this charity for people who are suffering tremendous deprivation in Gaza. And this is just completely unacceptable. " He said Australia expected "full accountability", adding that it was a "tragedy that should never have occurred". T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
