It's just past 16:00 in Israel and Gaza, and 14:00 in our London newsroom. We're following a few different developments today - here's a recap of where things stand: White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan is expected to press for Israeli strikes against Hamas to be more precise, as he meets Israeli leaders in Jerusalem. Ahead of Sullivan's visit, Israel's ambassador to the UK, Tzipi Hotovely, rejected a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinians, saying: "Absolutely no. . . the Palestinians never wanted to have a state next to Israel" British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak reiterated his support for a two state solution, saying it "is the right outcome" On the ground, intense fighting has continued in the Gaza Strip, with the southern cities of Khan Younis and Rafah hit by Israeli air strikes. Israel says it has arrested more than 70 Hamas members at a hospital in northern Gaza - while health officials in the Hamas-run territory accuse Israeli forces of preventing medical staff from proving care at the facility. The humanitarian situation in Gaza continues to alarm aid agencies, with the UN's humanitarian coordinator for the region describing the lack of clean water, sanitation, food and shelter as "a textbook formula for epidemics and a public health disaster" In the occupied West Bank, an Israeli operation in Jenin continued into its third day - 11 Palestinians have been killed, while the IDF says it has found dozens of weapons and also explosives laboratories and tunnel shafts. UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron has announced that "extremist settlers" responsible for violence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank will no longer be permitted to come to the UK. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
