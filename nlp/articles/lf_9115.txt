T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. The anger is palpable on the streets of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank. The killing of Saleh al-Arouri may have removed a significant name from both Israel’s and the US’s target list. A man they have long accused of being responsible for many terror activities. But the people here tell me they lost a senior figure of the resistance. “Saleh al-Arouri was not just a regular person he was an exceptional leader, a freedom fighter, an intellectual and we have so much respect for him," Hala Abu Gharbia tells me as she carries a Palestinian flag. She has come out for many protests since the beginning of the war in Gaza, but says this time there’s a new sense of loss.  “We feel great deal of rage, of fury and piercing  sadness. ”. Since Israel’s war with Hamas in Gaza, protesters have gathered regularly here at Al-Manara roundabout in the city centre. But it feels different this time. Almost all the shops in this bustling area were shut yesterday after the call for a general strike. The voices on the streets were that of protesters chanting Arouri’s name. Chanting for freedom, resistance and calling for revenge.     Some protesters were waving Palestinian flags, a couple of others carried green Hamas flags. Hala Abu Gharbia is in Ramallah protesting following the death of Arouri, who was from the West Bank. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
