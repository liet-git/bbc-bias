T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. There are, broadly, three dimensions to what Israel calls its "limited operation" in eastern Rafah. These are: political, military and humanitarian. Politically, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu is under pressure from the hard-line, right-wing elements of his coalition to carry out some sort of offensive in Rafah, especially now that last weekend’s ceasefire talks have stalled. Militarily, it is hard to see what this operation will achieve once it begins in earnest. The past five months of devastating conflict in Gaza have failed to produce the hoped-for release of hostages. The last time significant numbers of hostages came out of Gaza alive was in November and that was as a result of an exchange, painstakingly brokered by Qatar and Egypt. The Israeli military assesses that four battalions of Hamas have survived above and below ground in Rafah and they want to finish the job as they see it. But even if it succeeds in destroying these units the chances of the hostages escaping unscathed are slim. The humanitarian aspect is the most troubling. Israel puts the number of Gazans affected at this stage at 100,000. Palestinian aid agencies say the figure is closer to 250,000. Many of these people have already been displaced from their homes in the north of the territory. When the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was here in Israel a few days ago he was asked if Washington still opposed an Israeli operation in Rafah. His answer was unequivocal: “We cannot and will not support a major military operation absent an effective plan to make sure civilians are not harmed and no, we’ve not seen such a plan”. Israel will now be hoping that framing this as a "limited operation" will spare it from further damaging its relations with its US ally. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
