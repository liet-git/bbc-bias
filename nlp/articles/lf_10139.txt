Pope Francis called for a "ceasefire on every front, including Lebanon" in an address to diplomats at Vatican City. In his annual greetings to the Diplomatic Corps the Pope delivered a speech, commonly known as the State of the World address. He voiced his "deep concern regarding the events taking place in Israel and Palestine". The Pope renewed his condemnation of the deadly 7 October Hamas attack in southern Israel, where many innocent people were wounded, tortured, murdered and many taken hostage. Pope Francis also called for the immediate release of hostages. He reminded diplomats that Israel's retaliatory offensive in Gaza has led to the death of "tens of thousands of Palestinians", and caused "an exceptionally grave humanitarian crisis and inconceivable suffering". The leader of the Catholic Church called on leaders to ensure Palestinians receive necessary aid, and that "hospitals, schools and places of worship in Gaza receive all necessary protection". In reference to bringing the conflict to an end, the Pope said: "It is my hope that the international community will pursue with determination the solution of two states. One Israeli and one Palestinian. "As well as an internationally guaranteed special status for the city of Jerusalem, so that Israelis and Palestinians may finally live in peace and security.
