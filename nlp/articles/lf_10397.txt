Following on from those comments from the office of Israel's defence minister, let's take a look back at recent remarks from the country's prime minister about a Rafah offensive. Benjamin Netanyahu said last week that Israel would launch an invasion of the southern Gaza city regardless of truce talks with Hamas, saying that he would do this "with or without" a ceasefire deal. "The idea that we will halt the war before achieving all of its goals is out of the question," he said. "We will enter Rafah and we will eliminate the Hamas battalions there with or without a deal, in order to achieve the total victory," according to a statement issued by Netanyahu's office. More than half of Gaza's 2.5m population is in Rafah, having fled there to escape fighting in other parts of the territory. Conditions in the overcrowded city are dire, and displaced people there have spoken of a lack of food, water and medication. The US, along with the UN, have voiced their opposition to an invasion of Rafah. Read more here. Benjamin Netanyahu has long warned that Israel will invade Rafah. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
