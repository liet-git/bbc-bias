T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Rishi Sunak says the decision made by Sir Lindsay Hoyle last night to break with convention and allow Labour's motion was "very concerning because the usual ways in which Parliament works were changed". He points out that the Speaker has since apologised and promised to "reflect on what happened". "But I think the important point here is that we should never let extremists intimidate us into changing the way in which Parliament works. "Parliament is an important place for us to have these debates. And just because some people may want to stifle that with intimidation or aggressive behaviour, we should not bend to that and change how Parliament works. "That's a very slippery slope. " Sunak is referring to Hoyle saying that one of the reasons he allowed Labour's motion was to protect MPs from threats to their safety over the vote. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
