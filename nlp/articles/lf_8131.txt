T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. “After almost 11 years covering Parliament this is unprecedented territory for me,” says the Parliamentary Editor of the Press Association, Richard Wheeler. “I can't write explainers fast enough for this,” adds Dr Alice Lilly, a senior researcher at the Institute for Government. That gives you a sense of the scale of confusion at what’s happened today in the House of Commons. Meanwhile, MPs from the SNP and the Conservatives are still furious. Because they walked out in protest at the Speaker, they did not have the opportunity to register their votes on the calls for an immediate ceasefire. There remains intense pressure on the Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, tonight. He said he would meet with the whips from the main parties to discuss what has happened. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
