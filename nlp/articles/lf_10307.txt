Hamas's acceptance of (undisclosed) proposals appeared to offer a moment of hope in a months-long cycle of progress and setbacks. Momentum which led to Monday's statement by Hamas was kick-started just over a week ago, when an official from the group said it had "no major issues" with the latest proposal. At the same time, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the US was “hopeful” Hamas would accept the proposal, which he called “extraordinarily generous”. The terms were not publicised, but reports suggested that Israel had found a new form of words about a pause in fighting – talking about a "sustainable calm" in Gaza – something between a truce and a ceasefire. A day later, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said an offensive against Hamas in Rafah would go ahead regardless of whether there was a truce - raising doubts over Hamas's willingness to give a positive answer. Hopes were further dimmed on Sunday when talks in Cairo between Hamas and mediators stalled, with Israel and Hamas blaming each other. A rocket attack from Rafah by Hamas the same day which killed four Israeli soldiers, swiftly followed by Israeli air strikes on Rafah which reportedly killed 19 Palestinians - and Israel's order hours later for Palestinians to evacuate parts of Rafah - deepened a growing sense of pessimism. So when Hamas's leadership issued its statement on Monday evening saying they had approved the Egyptian and Qatari-mediated proposal, it bucked expectations. Neither Israel nor Hamas want to be held responsible for failing to reach a ceasefire - so each is showing they're prepared to keep going, as the urgency grows by the day.
