T-I-T-L-E-E-N-D.  T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. A little earlier , we reported on a spokesperson for Cogat - the Israeli body that coordinates humanitarian aid to Gaza - saying they hope an investigation into the killing of seven aid workers could report back in the next few days. An Israeli government spokesperson has since suggested that the investigation could take longer. "In the coming weeks, as the findings become clear, we will be transparent and share the results with the public," Raquela Karamson tells reporters. Karamson also echoes the suggestion by Cogat's Shimon Friedman that the review could lead to changes in how Israel conducts operations: Clearly, something went wrong here. And as we learn more and the investigation reveals exactly what happened and the cause of what happened, we will certainly adjust our practices in the future to make sure that this doesn't happen again.
