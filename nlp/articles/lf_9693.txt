President Joe Biden's remarks just now are a major intervention from the US president to draw Hamas back to the negotiating table. Israeli mediators in Doha, Qatar had passed on a new proposal to end the fighting and secure the release of hostages held by Hamas. That proposal was sent to Hamas on Wednesday, but the group demurred. It replied that it believed it had been negotiating in good faith and would not now come back to the table until there was a pause in the hostilities in Gaza. Biden's speech was his effort to point out this is a moment for both sides to "finally get this done". The US president is aware that there are also those in Israeli leadership who would want to stay in Gaza forever, and so the only alternative is for all sides to take the deal he is helping to lay out. I'm not convinced Biden's speech will be enough to bring Hamas back to the table - that will require help from both Qatar and Egypt. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
