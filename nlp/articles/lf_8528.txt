The parents of Jacob Flickinger, the US-Canadian citizen who's among seven aid workers killed in an Israeli air strike in Gaza, say the attack was a “crime” and have rejected Israel’s explanation for it. John Flickinger and Sylvia Labrecque tell me they believe the convoy was “chased down” and “targeted” as part of an attempt to use food as a weapon. They have called for an independent investigation and for Israel to pay reparations to the families of all aid workers killed in Gaza, thought to number about 200 since October. The Israeli military has apologised for the strike on the workers, calling it a tragic mistake, and has vowed to investigate. Flickinger, 33, was a dual citizen and had travelled to Gaza with the food aid charity World Central Kitchen. His parents say he wanted to help because he “knew that people were starving out there”.  The couple have not yet received a call from President Biden. They say no US official has contacted them and they were initially told of their son’s death by the US Embassy in Israel. “I would like to hear from someone in the US government,” Flickinger tells me, adding that the Canadian government has been “very helpful”.
