Cameron is now pressed on why the UK keeps selling arms to Israel and about the warnings about famine. Cameron avoids the question, instead repeating that Israel has a right to defend itself and it's "frustrating" that aid hasn't been getting into Gaza. The BBC's Nick Robinson picks at the word "frustrating" and says it doesn't quite do the situation justice, to which Cameron says the UK government has made its position clear: "We were one of the first to drop aid over Gaza - we've been absolutely clear about this and we are now making progress".
