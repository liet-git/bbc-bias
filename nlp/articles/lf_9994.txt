Foreign Secretary David Cameron has been doing the government's media round this morning and spoke to our colleagues at BBC Breakfast and Radio 4's Today programme along the way. The focus of both interviews was Iran's strikes on Israel over the weekend - and the UK's involvement by helping to defend Israel. Here are the key things he said: Cameron was unequivocal that Israel has a right to defend itself against attacks from Iran - but said the UK's advice is not to retaliate, calling on Israel to think with "its head, not its heart" The attack from Iran was a "double defeat", he said, because it failed both in terms of damage to Israel and showed Iran to be the "malign influence in the region" Cameron praised the involvement of the RAF in shooting down drones bound for Israel on Saturday night. Had the attack succeeded, he said, thousands could have died. When pushed on whether the UK has been stern enough on Israel in terms of protecting Palestinian civilians in Gaza, he said the UK's efforts are focused on ensuring a pause in fighting and getting aid into Gaza. We've also been told to expect a statement from PM Rishi Sunak later today, who'll be speaking in the House of Commons. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
