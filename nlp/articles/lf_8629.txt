On Tuesday, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) released a video claiming to show the aftermath of an Israeli strike on the al-Amal Hospital in Khan Younis, which killed five people including a new-born child. We cannot verify whether people were killed as the video does not show them, but it does show the hospital’s distinctive red livery and the wide concrete steps leading to its entrance. It matches the location of a video from the hospital shared by the PRCS on 20 December , which we previously verified. The video ends outside the hospital, where the shape of the buildings and placement of trees match those seen on Google and other maps of the area. The weather - partially cloudy with damp on the street - matches yesterday’s report of rain in Khan Younis. The World Health Organisation published its own video of the damage , and repeated the PRCS claim of a very young baby killed. The IDF have been contacted for comment.
