T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Gazans evacuating al-Shifa Hospital and the surrounding al-Rimal neighbourhood have been instructed by Israeli forces to head west, then south to the Israel-designated "humanitarian zone" in Al-Mawasi. Orders to evacuate to al-Mawasi have been given out to 2 million-odd residents of Gaza in recent months, but the area is a narrow strip of land by the Mediterranean Sea smaller than London's Heathrow Airport. It has few buildings and largely consists of sandy dunes and agricultural land. The zone, designated as safe by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), is just 8.5 sq km (3.3 sq miles). In February, the UN estimated some tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians were sheltering there. Read more about al-Mawasi here. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
