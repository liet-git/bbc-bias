Thanks for joining our coverage of the unrest at campuses across the US. Here's what to know about today's events: Law enforcement went in and cleared a number of pro-Palestinian camps, notably at UCLA. Clashes erupted between police and protestors as the camps were stormed and dismantled. Dozens of students and faculty were arrested and put on LAPD buses , many were seen on the ground with their hands zip-tied behind their backs. US President Joe Biden said students were free to protest but not "cause chaos" Pro-Palestinian demonstrations have now spread to dozens of campuses in the US and also some in Canada . There have been more than 1,000 arrests over the last few days. Columbia University in New York, where hundreds of police officers dismantled a camp earlier this week, has said it will hold final exams remotely. Police moved in to remove protesters from the campus library at Portland State University in Oregon. Other universities have reached compromises with protestors to stop demonstrations.
