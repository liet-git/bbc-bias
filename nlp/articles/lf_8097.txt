"Not a good day for humanity" is how the Palestinian envoy to the UK is describing events in the Commons yesterday. "To see this chaos in the House of Commons, it's really, really British politics at its lowest," Husam Zomlot told Channel 4 News last night. He says it was "disgraceful and shameful" that MPs were debating calling for a ceasefire after more than 29,000 people had been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry there. "MPs have tonight have shown everybody they are defending and protecting their careers as opposed to defending and protecting children. " Israel began its military campaign in Gaza after Hamas attacked southern Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and taking about 240 people hostage. Husam Zomlot said yesterday's scenes in the Commons were "disgraceful" T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
