It was organised by the group London for a Free Palestine, which has been urging the party to "call for an immediate, permanent and unconditional ceasefire". Images posted on social media show a long white banner reading "Full Ceasefire Now" being held up by people on the side of the road. Some protesters can be seen wearing masks of members of the Labour front bench – including leader Sir Keir Starmer and deputy leader Angela Rayner. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
