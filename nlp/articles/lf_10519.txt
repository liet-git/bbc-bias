The UN estimates that tens of thousands of people have evacuated Rafah since Monday after Israeli authorities warned around 110,000 people in the southern border city to Rafah to flee. Many of those displaced people have been arriving in the city of Al-Mawasi in Khan Younis throughout the week. Abdullah Yad El Arsha, one of those people who was forced to make the exodos out of Rafah to Khan Younis, shares with the BBC Arabic's Gaza Lifeline how people on the street were charging him exorbitant fees just to make a safe getaway. "We couldnâ€™t find any transport and the road was full of people. I walked around six kilometres carrying my things with no money. Sellers asked for about 80 to 1000 shekels to transport us from East Rafah to Al-Mawasi Khan Younis. " T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
