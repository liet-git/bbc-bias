Last night the Speaker said one of his main reasons for allowing the Labour amendment to be voted on was because of concerns for MPs' safety. This issue was brought up again this morning in the House of Commons during a session where MPs could put questions to the government. Barry Sheerman , Labour MP for Huddersfield, spoke of his experience of receiving a death threat and the impacts it has had on his life. Earlier today Labour MP Stella Creasy told the BBC she had faced "threats and intimidation" and MPs needed to be able to debate in parliament without fear. "Where does this end if we're saying that MPs and their families and their homes are fair game?" she said. In November Labour MP Jo Stevens 's Cardiff office was vandalised following a vote on a ceasefire in Gaza. Conservative MP Mike Freer says he is standing down at the next election over safety fears. In 2016 Jo Cox , Labour MP for Batley and Spen, was murdered in broad daylight and five years later Sir David Amess , Conservative MP for Southend West, was stabbed more than 20 times in his office.
