We’ve been hearing throughout the day from some of the 600,000 children currently sheltering in the southern city of Rafah. The Israeli military previously told people from other parts of Gaza to evacuate to Rafah, declaring it a safe zone, but it now appears to be considering entering the city, saying an offensive is necessary to eliminate Hamas. Mahmoud Ibrahim Radwan, 12, told BBC Arabic that he left some of his family in northern Gaza in order to travel south, but that he now wants to go back. “They tell us to evacuate… and after we [leave], they bombard leaving no house standing,” he said. “When the bombardment is near us, we keep moving from one tent to another. When we go back to our tent, we find it ruined. “They say Rafah is safe [but] if they enter Rafah, we will die here. We want a ceasefire. We want the firing to stop and go back to our family in the north. “Even if we don’t have money we will stay in a tent in front of our homes and sleep. ”. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
