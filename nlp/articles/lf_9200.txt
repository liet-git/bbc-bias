Israel made it clear it would respond, in some way, to Iran’s "swarm" attack of drones and missiles last weekend and now it seems it has. If this is indeed the beginning and end of Israel’s response then it does appear to be very limited in size and scope. Isfahan this morning looks normal. All week Israel’s Western allies, notably the US and Britain, have been imploring its government not to carry out a heavy response to the Iranian missile attack. Although that was a dramatic escalation, it was in itself a retaliation for Israel’s unprecedented air strike on Iran’s consulate in Damascus on 1 April that killed 13 people including two top generals. How this develops now from here will depend on two things: Whether that is the end of Israel’s attack and whether Iran now decides to attack back. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
