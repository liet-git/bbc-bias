T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. On the surface, Israel's announcement that it has pulled all but one brigade out of southern Gaza would seem to suggest a noteworthy shift in the Israeli army's strategy there. But it may not presage any major change. Israel has previously withdrawn other troops when their military objective is judged to have been completed. An army statement has said the 98th commando division had left Gaza in order to "recuperate and prepare for future operations". The military has stressed that a "significant force" remains in Gaza, with the ability to preserve the Israel Defense Forces' "freedom of action". That sends a message that the pull-out is tactical and does not suggest the war may be moving closer to its end. But a military operation that focuses on narrower targets may lessen the likelihood of heavy civilian casualties. That is something that Israel's closest and most powerful ally, the US, has been applying increasing pressure on the Israeli government to do. The US would certainly be extremely concerned if the move proved to be related to the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's repeatedly stated intention to mount an operation against Hamas in the southernmost Gazan town of Rafah, where more than one million displaced Palestinians have taken refuge.
