Speaking about conversations he had with Israel, he says they were focused on three things: the hostage negotiations, humanitarian assistance, and Rafah. Blinken says important "candid" conversations were had. "We have the same goals," Blinken tells reporters as both Washington and Israel are committed to "defeating Hamas" and Israel's long-term security, but the secretary of state adds that a major ground operation in Rafah is not the way to achieve it. Blinken also tells reporters that any goals should be achieved with an integrated humanitarian, military and political plan. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
