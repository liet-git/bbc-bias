On recent trips by senior US officials, they have made a point of engaging with leaders of the Palestinian Authority (PA), political rivals to Hamas who govern parts of the occupied West Bank. There are two main reasons: they want to stop the conflict in Gaza from spreading further and plan for the day after the war, which Israel says is meant to topple Hamas from power. Despite opposition from Israeli leaders, Washington envisages a role for the PA. A US official said today’s discussions in Ramallah would look at “ongoing efforts to revamp and revitalise” the PA and ways to combat “extremist settler violence” against Palestinians in the West Bank. What adds to the complications for Washington is the unpopularity of the PA among Palestinians. A poll this week indicated that this had only increased since the war began with some 60% calling for its dissolution. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
