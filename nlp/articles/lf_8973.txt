First up in this morning's political interviews we hear from deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden . Laura begins by asking Dowden if Israel is acting within humanitarian law. He reiterates the government line that it is not publishing advice, but he explains Israel was "subject to the most appalling attack" six months ago. "Israel is still facing this existential threat from Hamas," Dowden adds. "Of course in the conduct of this war we are holding Israel to high standards. "We are engaging with Israel on a number of issues - making sure they are not targeting aid workers. "Secondly we need to get more aid into Gaza. The people of Gaza have suffered enough from Hamas and now this," Dowden says. Deputy Prime Minister Oliver Dowden speaking on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
