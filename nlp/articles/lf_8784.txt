The UN Security Council has called an emergency meeting for today to discuss an Israeli air strike which killed dozens of displaced Palestinians in Rafah on Sunday. The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has described the strike as a "tragic mishap," but there's growing international condemnation of the incident. The closed door emergency meeting of the Security Council was requested by Algeria - and comes after the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres added his voice to the international outcry over the Rafah attack. He said the situation there was "a horror that had to stop" and that there was "no safe place in Gaza". According to the Hamas-run health ministry at least 45 people were killed by the strike on Sunday. Hundreds more were treated for severe burns, fractures and shrapnel wounds. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
