A lot has taken place since yesterday's resolution announcement from the UN, calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. Here's what's been happening: Fighting has continued despite the UN's calls for a ceasefire , with Israel carrying out attacks on more than 60 "terror targets" in Gaza in the last 24 hours. Israel has claimed UN ceasefire calls have hindered their negotiations with Hamas. But the US State Department said the UN resolution was passed after Hamas' latest response to hostage release demands. Al-Amal hospital in southern Gaza is "out of service" after Israeli troops forced medics and patients to evacuate, according to the Palestine Red Crescent Society. The death toll in Gaza has risen to 32,414 , according to the Hamas-run Palestinian health ministry, with 81 people killed in the last day. Hamas says it is sticking to its original position in calling for a full ceasefire , which Israel has called "delusional" Qatar's foreign ministry spokesman has said the UN resolution has had no "immediate impact" on the ongoing negotiations between Israel and Hamas. A UN human rights expert has said she believes Israel has committed "acts of genocide" in Gaza. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
