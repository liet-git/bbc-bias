Over to the University of Minnesota now, where the administration has announced it has reached a deal with pro-Palestinian student organisations to remove an encampment on its campus. The university says in a statement that in addition, the student coalition has agreed they will not disrupt upcoming final exams and commencements. In return, the university says it has agreed to a number of actions, including a commitment to allow representatives of the student group to address the board of regents to advocate for divestment. The university also says that no one will face criminal charges and that it will not pursue disciplinary action against those who were involved. Other universities have already reached compromises with protesters. The University of Vermont agreed to disclose a list of its investments, while Northwestern University and Brown have also reached agreements to remove encampments. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
