T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. As we've been reporting , the Hamas-run health ministry says 20,000 people have been killed in Gaza since 7 October. Dr Dani Poole, a population health scientist at Yale University says one way to consider whether the figures are robust is to look at historic trends. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s PM programme, she says the figures from the Palestinian health ministry have historically been “aligned with independent United Nations estimates, and even the Israeli foreign ministry figures”. Another way to look at them is to compare them with other data sources, she says, giving the example of the number of staff from the UN's Palestinian refugee agency Unrwa that have been killed. Poole says the mortality rate for Unrwa staff is similar to the rate being put forward by the ministry of health for Gaza as a whole. She also notes that people are only counted when they are brought into medical facilities or morgues, "which often people aren’t in an active war zone”. She adds that several of these buildings have been damaged or destroyed, which creates a further problem for recording numbers. These issues "would suggest possible under-reporting", she adds.
