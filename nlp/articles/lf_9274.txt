Germany wants the EU to consider sanctions on Israeli extremists responsible for violence in the occupied West Bank, a foreign ministry spokesman says. It comes after the US this week announced a visa ban on those responsible for the rise in attacks against Palestinians in the West Bank since 7 October. Sebastian Fischer said Berlin welcomed the fact that the US “will now take concrete measures in the form of entry restrictions”. It was "important to drive this debate forward at European level too”, he said adding that Germany is contributing to discussions on the topic ahead of a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels on Monday.
