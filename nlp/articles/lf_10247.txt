Internet and phone networks in the Gaza Strip have gone down, the region's main telecommunications company has said. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Paltel confirms "all telecom services" in Gaza have "been lost due to the ongoing aggression". "Gaza is blacked out again," the firm adds. Mobile phone and internet services have gone down several times in Gaza since war broke out, including one outage about a month ago caused by a lack of fuel for back-up generators to power the network.
