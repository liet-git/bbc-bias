An update from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) now, which says it killed a Hamas commander in Gaza City yesterday. In a statement, the Israeli military identifies him as Ahmed Ghoul, commander of the group's Shati Battalion. The IDF says Ghoul was involved in the 7 October attacks by Hamas on Israel. It adds that after his return to Gaza, Ghoul held hostage 19-year-old Israeli woman Noa Marciano, whose body was discovered in a building next to Shifa Hospital in November. Hamas's military wing claimed Noa Marciano was killed in an Israeli air strike on 9 November, although this could not be independently verified at the time. Noa Marciano was a lookout at the Nahal Oz kibbutz when it was stormed by gunmen on 7 October. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
