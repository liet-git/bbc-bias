T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. We've been hearing from Palestinians returning to Khan Younis after Israel withdrew troops from southern Gaza. Speaking to BBC Arabic, Hamed Yaser Ahmed Abo Hayah says the area has suffered "complete destruction". He adds he hasn't been able to change his clothes in seven months. "I wash them before I sleep and then put them on the window and sleep with my boxer and in the morning, I wear them as they are," he says. "Itâ€™s been seven months till now, and my clothes have not been changed, I only change them at night and wear them in the morning after they have sat in the sun. There is no life". T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
