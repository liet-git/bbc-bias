The situation in Nasser hospital is very complicated and it's no longer possible to accurately verify the information there. A short while ago, three journalists who had in the hospital arrived in Rafah - two of them had sustained injuries. They told fellow reporters an Israeli bulldozer demolished the southern wall of the medical complex and soldiers entered the emergency departments. Israeli soldiers told doctors and nurses to transfer the sick and injured people in the old surgical department, and they asked the displaced to gather in the outer courtyard. The journalists left the hospital before 07:00 local time (05:00 GMT), which is the time set by the Israeli army as the last chance for anyone who wants to leave. Soldiers checked the identities of those leaving through a military checkpoint set up near the hospital, and more than 20 people were arrested. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
