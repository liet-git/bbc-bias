I’ve just been speaking with Greg Crowther, from Mines Advisory Group (MAG), who says there will be “thousands and thousands of unexploded items” in the Gaza Strip. Apart from the week-long ceasefire that ended last week, Israel has been bombing Gaza almost constantly since the war began in early October, as part of its efforts to wipe out Hamas. It accuses the group of hiding among civilians. “Under such bombardment and ground fighting in such heavily populated areas, it’s impossible not to be indiscriminate, impossible not to create disproportionate human casualties,” Crowther says. He says that MAG was active in Gaza for two years after the 2008-09 war, when it cleared more than 1,000 items of unexploded ordnance. “Then you look at the scale of this conflict, and you are looking at a massive amount of contamination,” he says. “We know from experience that a huge percentage [of bombs] don’t explode. ”. “There will be thousands and thousands of unexploded items. ”. Israel has said it plans to rebuild Gaza once Hamas is defeated, but the large presence of unexploded bombs will be a hindrance to that. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
