Protesters inside the encampment have started to tear down their own barricades on one side to take elsewhere. We heard them shouting "police are firing rubber bullets at us". (Law enforcement is yet to confirm this and the BBC can't verify the claims). There are a lot of loud bangs going off, which appears to be a mixture of police using flash bangs to disrupt protesters, and protesters setting off fireworks. We have seen protesters being led away by police and officers tearing down lines of barricades around the camp. In the last few minutes, we've just heard another loud volley of flash bangs as police move further in the encampment. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
