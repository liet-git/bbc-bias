There are more than 1.4 million Gazans crowded into Rafah - five times its pre-war population. According to the Norwegian Refugee Council that works out at 22,000 people for every square kilometre. Already disease is spreading, with outbreaks of diarrhoea, hepatitis A, and meningitis - as well as a continuing hunger crisis. Rafah is where the refugees of Gaza reach the final wall, the border with Egypt which is closed to the overwhelming majority of the displaced. They arrived after being pushed from one place to another by the advance of the Israeli forces. Israel has long insisted that it will invade Rafah. But NGOs say there is nowhere for the displaced to go. A new offensive will only result in more civilian dying, they say. And families of Israeli hostages still held in Gaza say their loved ones will be put in further danger by an IDF offensive. The World Health Organization (WHO) is already preparing for additional field hospitals to help if people are forced to move. But there are questions about what happens to the seriously ill and the elderly currently in overcrowded hospitals in Rafah. "If you look at our health sector, it is crippled already and an incursion will actually mean that we lose another three hospital," says Rik Peeperkorn, regional director of the WHO, who recently returned from Rafah.
