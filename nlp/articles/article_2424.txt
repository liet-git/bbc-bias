A man has pleaded guilty to making antisemitic posts on X, formerly Twitter. Peter Kandalaft, 57, sent multiple tweets following Hamas' attack on Israel on 7 October and Israel's subsequent invasion of Gaza. Officers arrested Kandalaft at his home address of Bourneside Road, Addlestone, Surrey on 11 January and seized an iPhone and iPad. The court heard Kandalaft posted 21 tweets between 2 November and 25 December 2023 that were reported to the police by a charity. But Mr Kandalaft's X account had been suspended by the time police investigated the report. During a police interview, he said he was Palestinian, his account had been hacked, and that he had "no particular views on Hamas or Jewish people". He appeared in the dock and spoke only to confirm his name, age and to plead guilty to sending "at least three" indecent, obscene or menacing posts on X between 19 November and 19 December 2023. He was released on conditional bail and ordered not to post on X. He also faces a charge of possessing an offensive weapon that will be dealt with at the same court on 19 August.
