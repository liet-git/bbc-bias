We've been monitoring Hassan Nasrallah's televised speech, in which he offered his condolences to Hamas for what he called a "dangerous" killing of Saleh al-Arouri. Here are some of the main points Nasrallah made: He said if there was an attempt to wage a war against Lebanon, the country's "battle will be boundless, without rules" Nasrallah claimed Hezbollah's "quick" action on 8 October and the cross-border shelling had prevented a broader bombing campaign by Israel of Lebanon. He added that it was the first time something like this had happened since the 2006 Lebanon War. Nasrallah also vowed there would be "no ceilings" to his group's fighting if Israel chose to launch a war on Lebanon and that Israel would "regret it" He praised Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi movement for their actions in targeting ships in the Red Sea. He described al-Arouri as "a great leader" and said he was killed in an act of "blatant Israeli aggression" Nasrallah vowed there would be "no ceilings" to his group's fighting. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
