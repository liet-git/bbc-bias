T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. Joe Biden’s threat to cut off further weapons supplies to Israel in the event of a full-scale assault on Rafah is "very disappointing", Israel's ambassador to the United Nations says. "This is a difficult and very disappointing statement to hear from a president to whom we have been grateful since the beginning of the war," Gilad Erdan tells Israeli public broadcaster Kan radio. "If Israel is restricted from entering an area as important and central as Rafah where there are thousands of terrorists, hostages and leaders of Hamas, how exactly are we supposed to achieve our goals?"
