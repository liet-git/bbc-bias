A military base in Iraq housing a pro-Iranian militia has been damaged in an explosion, security officials there have said. The incident comes amid heightened tensions between Israel and Iran. Here's what we know so far: Iraq's military reported no drones or fighter jets in the area before or during the blast, and the US said it was not involved. The militia, the Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF), blamed an attack. The explosion at Kalso military base, about 50km (30 miles) south of Baghdad, happened early on Saturday, the military said. It was being used by the PMF, a paramilitary dominated by Iran-backed Shia Muslim militias. A member of the PMF was killed in the blast and eight others were wounded. The PMF said its chief of staff, Abdul Aziz al-Mohammedawi, had visited the base to review what investigators had found so far. The Iraqi military also said it was investigating the cause of the explosion. The PMF's chief of staff (C-R) visits a man wounded in the explosion at a hospital. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
