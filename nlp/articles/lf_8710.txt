Father-of-four Ahmed Qishta , 33, tells AFP new agency that there has never been "such an Eid - all sadness, fear, destruction and a grinding war". Abir Sakik , 40, who had to flee her family's home in Gaza City and is now living in a tent in Rafah, says Gazans "want to rejoice despite all the blood, death and shelling". "We are tired and weary, enough, enough of war and destruction. " Tens of thousands of Palestinians are also praying at the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, Islam's third holiest site. Nurse Rawan Abd , 32, from Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem tells AFP it is "the saddest Eid ever, at the mosque you could see the sadness on people's faces.
