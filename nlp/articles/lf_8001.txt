It's just after 19:00 in Israel and 17:00 here in the UK. These are the latest developments: Russia and China have vetoed a US draft resolution that tied an immediate ceasefire in Gaza to the release of hostages held by Hamas. The US accused Russia of putting "politics over progress" following the vote, while Russia said the US draft was a "hypocritical spectacle" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has finished his visit to the Middle East and spoke to reporters in Israel before boarding a plane back to Washington. He said there had been "some positive steps" on aid in Gaza, and ceasefire negotiations are down to a "few remaining gaps" He again cautioned Israel against a military operation in Rafah. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told Blinken that entering Rafah was the only way to defeat Hamas. Meanwhile, a separate UN draft resolution will be voted on by the security council tomorrow. T-E-X-T-E-N-D.
