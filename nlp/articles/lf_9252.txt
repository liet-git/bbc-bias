Jabalia refugee camp in the north of Gaza used to be one of the most densely populated areas on the Strip and the territory's largest refugee camp. The camp covers an area of just 1.4 sq km and before the current conflict was home to more than 115,000 people, according to the UN. Now it's under intense bombardment by Israeli forces, and despite evacuation orders Hamas-run local authorities say tens of thousands of residents remain in the area in dire conditions .
