German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock is calling on the European Union to impose fresh sanctions on Iranian drone technology. She says she campaigned last year - together with France and other EU countries - for the drone sanctions regime to be extended. Meanwhile, Baerbock is heading to Israel today for talks on calming tensions in the region. She told reporters it was important for Germany "in these fragile times that we all work together to contribute to de-escalation" in the Middle East. After Iran's attack on Saturday night, she said "Israel can protect itself", and condemned Iran's "aggressive behaviour". She said the regime wanted to "destabilise an entire region".
