T-I-T-L-E-E-N-D.  T-E-X-T-S-T-A-R-T. The United Nations Security Council has referred the Palestinian Authority's application to become a full member of the UN to the committee on the admission of new members. The Ambassador to the UN for Malta, which is presiding over the Security Council for April, proposed that the committee meet on Monday at 15:00 local time (20:00 GMT) to consider the application. It is extremely unlikely that the Palestinian Authority's application will be successful, as it requires at least nine votes in favour and no vetoes from any of the Security Council's five permanent members, which are the United States, Russia, China, France and the United Kingdom.
